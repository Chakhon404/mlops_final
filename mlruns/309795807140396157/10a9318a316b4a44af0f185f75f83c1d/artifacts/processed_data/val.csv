"it really pisses me off i am sorry if i sound really blunt but it needs to be said. having suicidal thoughts and feeling like total shit most days while seeming visibly okay calm feels completely surreal and not in a good way. it is almost like i have to replay my previous suicide attempts mental health crises in my head so that i can reassure myself that i am struggling and that i am not just bullshitting my problems for pity or sympathy. it is not the only reason but a big reason why there are still so many ""shocking"" and unexpected suicides because and i have been told this by people people think that if you see your friends and if you laugh and smile and chat to people then you cannot be depressed, lots of people think being depressed is never seeing your friends, crying constantly and not smiling or laughing. it is really dangerous. stop saying you care about suicidal people when you only mean the people who are visibly struggling unwell",6

"ear infection or something more? hi all, this is sort of a follow up post from this i woke up with ear pain this morning in addition to the other symptoms and i ve had recurring ear infections for the past few years so i didn t think it was related to everything else going on. the doctor said that it s a middle ear infection and my lungs sounded clear, my throat looked fine, etc. so the fever and aches are all from the ear. while i was in the waiting room i went and replied to my post above. a few minutes after the receptionist called me up to the desk to get my doctors note for work and when i got there i fainted like full on blacked out, unconscious, woke up confused and surrounded by nurses, etc. i ve fainted before but only when needles were involved. the doctor said i had low blood pressure and low blood sugar probably true, i ve had no appetite and have barely eaten and the fainting was not because of the ear infection itself. i m home now and my fever is still 100. i m just worried because the ear pain didn t even start until today but i ve had the fever since yesterday. do you guys think i need a second opinion or am i overanalyzing this?",0

"bipolar versus ""trauma"" i have been dxd as bipolar 1 for the last 5 years, had signs before that. i am on some meds, but we're always trying to find a better combo, and i do weekly ect which helps the most. i have to do therapy, so i have been the the last few months, and my therapist wanted me to meet the therapy head counselor manager person, and had me take this one 1-4 on each question thing after, my therapist who is still in school to become a social worker, says she doesn't think i'm bipolar, and the manager comes in and sees the sheet of paper and says something like ""yeah, this is very common for people that think they have bipolar t's just their trauma response"" and i'm supposed to hear from the trauma dept for other info.....but i have been dx'd by more than 1 doctor by this.....this is completely setting me off. i see my regular psych tomorrow but wanted to know if anyone had any similar experiences....",1

"sorry but this will probably be rambling. i am having a harder and harder time finding a reason to do anything anymore. i have a great job but i cannot focus. moved into a nice new home, but cannot even unbox the first thing. going through a rough divorce, but i always said she was my light, and now without her i cannot see a reason to do anything. nothing seems worth it anymore. being in her presence made me a better person, made me feel i could do anything. now i struggle to make it to the bedroom door every morning. for the last few months i have leaned heavily on my support group, but i can feel them stepping away as i overburdened them time and again. i am afraid to tell my therapist and i do not know why. maybe i am afraid they will lock me up. all i know is i spent 27 years lost in the world before i met her, and then 7 years feeling like i had found heaven. now i wish i could feel nothing. that would be an upgrade. i am just empty. so empty. i do not see how i can do this without her in my life. i thought moving out of our shared house would make things better. but it is 1000 times worse. i cannot keep feeling like this, but i do not see a way out. i need her. so badly. she was my everything. i even loved her flaws. probably loved them most of all as that is what made her human. i do not know what to do. i just know i need her. i have to find a way to move on without her. but i cannot even imagine tomorrow in my head right now. to say the least of a future. i am so tired and so empty. and the world feels so dark. and i do not know what to do anymore. i thought i was depressed in the past, but no. i am just so empty. cannot find a reason anymore",2

"not looking for pity. just want to get this out there. also ill probably end up deleting this eventually. backstory queue the clich ultra successful father and i am just a dipshit fuckup story. i am his first born son. i have never lived up to his expectations, flunked out of college, and now i work in a call center and live with a roommate because i cannot afford to live on my own. you know, that old chestnut. my grandpa, who was a huge father figure in my life after my parents divorced, committed suicide a couple years ago. i developed a raging alcohol addiction which hung around even after i had mentally gotten over the initial shock. in spite of this, everything was actually going well. i lost 60 pounds on keto, was lifting and running 5 miles a day, but then covid hit and the gyms shut down. then i fucked up by not getting back into exercising once they reopened. i started drinking myself into a stupor and still do every day and night. at work, they forced us to start taking regular old loyalty calls since were some of the most tenured agents. yup, i have been getting yelled at professionally for the last 5 fucking years. i went from customer service, to tech, advanced tech, advanced internet tech, providing internal support to other agents, commercial support and sales for businesses, but now, this fucking loyalty shit is insane. i was getting through it, working with my boss to handle these calls better, but sweet jesus, the loyalty department is just not my fucking jam and have always known that i never wanted to go there. i get that they must have looked at all their options and said well shit we have nobody else to take these calls so were going to have to make them do it, but at the same time, my job is so vastly different from what it was before and is now mostly handing a call type that i have avoided like the plague that it just fucking feels unfair. i get off work and just start slamming shots, chugging beer, and sitting outside smoking for an hour after work. every. fucking. day. on days off, after i have had my caffeine and have woken up, i start drinking by 9-10 am. shit, i am outside drinking and chain smoking as i write this. i was not even doing any of that before this loyalty bullshit. this job is literally slowly killing me. problem is, i am making like 23 an hour and do not know where the fuck else i can go to make even close to that. i have 0 skills...i did not intend for this to be so long. so now to the present. my dog died 2 weeks ago and that just fucked up my whole world. i work from home and had him there to comfort me all day and now i just feel so alone. i was starting to feel somewhat normal and then a week and a half later my grandma passed away. and i just have to put a fucking smile on while people tell me to eat shit and die all day now. fuck!plus there is just the overarching feeling of doom and gloom with this covid bullshit. like since its endemic, i guess were going to have constant lockdowns and vaccines shoved down our throats. fucking awesome. i guess my best years are behind me. hit with a bunch of shit all at once and just need to word vomit and get this off my chest.",2

"i would have liked to consider myself as someone who recovered - like someone battling cancer or other similar diseases. like its been 6 years now, can i say that i do not have major depressive disorder anymore? what is damning about mental health is that its closer to an ongoing process - closer to what you might see in recovering addicts. i am having my first major relapse depressive period in almost 6 years. my initial depression was something i did not recognize- something i was not consciously aware of. honestly, i did not know of another way of thinking that long ago, and thought my life would always be like this, id always feel like this.. its a miracle i lived as long as i have. with the help of a counselor who was able to change my perspective, a psychiatrist and developing a support system, i was able to overcome the lowest of my depression and finally feel. normal?now, i know what both feels like. what is normal and what is abnormal. i have had some small bumps and up and downs throughout time, but nothing major. i was always self aware enough of what negative patterns start to lead me to a downward spiral. i have maintained medication and self-care habits to keep me from the edge. right now, i am in a major depressive episode. i do not know what happened. all of the sudden i was thinking of killing myself again. it first started actively thinking of ways to off myself. i could not think of anything else. then, those thoughts started to think in the background. i was grocery shopping, looking at fruits and trying to think if i wanted an apple, then i was hoping that something would happen and kill me there. its this weird disconnect where i feel so self aware of these thoughts unlike before. like i know i am moving slowly. i have to think about the next step on refilling water than just doing the entire process fluidly open lid, think next step, ok put lid on side, ok what is next, . when i sit and stare at a blank wall, part of me wants to laugh because i know what is happening, but i cannot stop. i am still self aware mentally, but my body cannot take the action to start moving. i know its the symptoms of my depression, and i want to laugh everytime i notice it, because, hey its there and i know it is, but it will not go away and its making me do weird things like staring at blank walls for 12 hours. another thing i have noticed is when i talk to other people, its not a seamless experience of reacting to emotions and providing non-verbal cues with verbal responses. i am taking in the information, putting everything i have into listening, then i have to think about what you said then decide how i should act. like i am thinking about whether to frown or how to show concern on my face, then i can finally maybe think of something to say. its like this very unnatural experience to try and stay normal. sleeping regularly is something that i used to take pride in. now i cannot sleep until the sun rises, but then to try and correct my sleep, ill wake up 3 hours later. ill feel so tired both physically and mentally until about 10pm, when i finally feel ready to accomplish a small task. from 9am-10pm, i spend my time trying to gather some form of strength to move, to accomplish something, to do dishes or laundry or really, anything. now that i am not a teen or young adult anymore, and as someone who now has a career and a job where other people need me, well, its not going good to say the least. there is no real end to this because there is no end, and i am currently suffering from an depressive episode. i feel close to a crisis but also feel too aware and cannot just let things be like this. i guess to end this, would be some advice or help? i am in so deep that doing simple things take 10 hours before i can do it. i try to think of things i used to enjoy doing, but cannot even fathom any enjoyment in them- i.e., hiking- right now, its just a lot of effort to look at some effing shrubs and trees. what were the small things you have done to pull yourself out? thinking of taking medical leave and seeing my psychiatrist seem like an impossibility daunting task right now. relapse ramble amp support?",2

"i have a plan, but not an exact date. sometime in august. i have an unknowing accomplice a tinder date who likes to take long scooter rides. we did one 24 hour ride a few weeks ago, around the whole island of taiwan. i asked if he would take me to a really tall bridge on the southern end of the island, which would be a 12 hour drive, both ways. he thinks i want to go there to enjoy the view and take pictures. it is technically a tourist spot. i do not have my own transportation, so if he does not take me i will have to wait until later this year, when i can afford my own scooter. i fantasize about jumping taking my helmet off, walking away from my companion, putting enough distance between us so he will not have a chance to grab me, and climbing over the guard rail in one smooth motion. i looked at the guard rail on google maps so i could imagine how exactly i would climb over it. i do not want to stumble. i do not want to give him a chance to grab me. i feel motivated to desensitize myself to the idea jumping, so i will not hesitate once i get there. there is a small part of me that does not want to go through with it, but i have a strong desire to overcome this. i feel morally obligated to give living a chance, because i know how suicide affects the people left behind. i feel bitter and angry towards the people that love me, for making me feel guilty for wanting to end it. i cannot seem to picture a future that i can look forward to. trying to imagine the future makes me feel agitated and makes my chest hurt. and yet, imagining my grandparents or my brothers finding out that i jumped off a bridge, makes me feel horrible as well. the tension between these two variables is driving me fucking crazy. cannot stop fantasising about suicide",6

"i just do not understand why it is so difficult for me to just, breathe and be okay however i am... my past traumas just attack me endlessly and that ruins my present. hence, making me want to not look forward to my future. i have so much to write but i do not know where to start. i am not sure if saying it all anonymously is going to help me at all. i just feel empty. and as i am writing this, i hope i do not wake up tomorrow. i just want it to end. i am 23 now and i am tired. i do not want to live anymore, neither do i want to kill myself. i have tried that 3 times already, i gave up on it as i have failed 3 fucking times. lol.jokes on me. i do not know if i should tell everything, but i have only joined this community because i know i am fucked up. and sharing it with my family will not make a fuckin difference. there were many times i tried hinting it at them, that ""hey, i am fucked up. i do not want to wake up tomorrow. is there any way my family can help me?"" they brushed it off. lol. to my family, depression is not even real. it is all the devil's work.that makes my work short, because i know putting in effort there is just waste. if anyone reads this post, let me know if it is okay for me to share what reasons made me the way i am today. and if it is a bother, please do not use harsh commands. just be civil about it and i will get it straight. thanks why is it so hard to accept whatever there is in life?",2
"a revolution in the treatment of depression ? a bbc article looking at the link between depression and inflammation. you can read the article here from the article gt inflammation is part of the immune system's response to danger. it is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces. if inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. if it is too high, it causes damage. gt gt and for some reason, about one-third of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. hayley is one of them ""i do have raised inflammation markers, i think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40, it's coming up regularly in blood tests."" gt gt there is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients, but is actually the cause of their disease. that the immune system can alter the workings of the brain. hopefully this might offer another treatment approach for those of us who mostly suffer from depression. there is also a 30 minute bbc podcast on the subject here",1

"don t know if i have borderline personality disorder or bipolar? sorry if my this doesn t come out properly, i feel sometimes as if i have so many things to say, but i don t know exactly what it is to say. this is mostly a venting. when i was a kid, i was diagnosed with depression. i ve mostly felt depressed my entire life due to emotional, physical and sexual abuse growing up. i was always tired, fatigued, i could barely get up in the morning and do things as simple as brushing my hair, taking a shower, eating, etc. after i got married, whenever my husband and i would get into arguments, i would feel so overwhelmed with emotions that i would scream and start to hit him, it literally felt like my mind was going to burst, and sometimes i would place my hands on my head to keep my thoughts from blowing up. but then when i would blow up, i would start screaming and hitting things without any discernible purpose. we just thought i was just an overly emotional person, because we never assumed anything was wrong other than my depression. so we went through several years of that, until a few years ago, i had an emotional affair with someone that literally seemed it came out of nowhere. at that time we started going to a doctor for depression where he also diagnosed me with bipolar depression ? , and anxiety. and then prescribed me, vibryyd, then lamictol, trileptol, zoloft, gabpentin, sorry for the spelling and then finally wellbutrin. not all at the same time just in a period of a year i also went to a therapist who told me to pretty much divorce my husband and at that time i felt like that was the greatest thing to do, so i went through with it up until the paperwork, and then suddenly decided i didn t want to go through with it. around that time i also stopped my affair extremely abruptly it felt like i literally woke up one day and didn t want anything to do with that person and situation. throughout all this time, i ve had about 15 jobs, either quitting or being fired. i would be really happy for months, i would be excellent at my job, then suddenly i felt like doing nothing, i would lose complete interest and that showed in my quality of work. there was also a point where i drank heavily when i had the affair, to the point where i would be drunk everyday. that feeling to get drunk did go away just as quickly as the feeling to have the affair did as well. thankfully my husband and i got through it all, he forgave me and i ve been extremely consistent with my medicine and trying to make things as easy as possible for my mental health. my doctor at that time prescribed me xanax for my anxiety with did not help at all. it made me feel like hell. if i took it and didn t fall asleep immediately after, my body and bones would feel like they were shaking, and my mind felt like everything was sped up even more. this caused me to jump in front of oncoming traffic to kill myself because the pain was just so bad. i wasn t harmed thankfully, but i did get baker acted until i weaned my self off the xanax, which was an incredibly low dose, if i remember correctly. i also put on 20 pound during this time which worsened my depression. after all this, my doctor took me off xanax, and lamictol, and just kept me on a new medicine, wellbutrin cl 300mg i felt great. i suddenly had all the energy in the world, and was able to get up and do things! i did have some depressive days, but they went away fairly quickly. i was really happy, i thought i found the medicine for me! but it stopped working, i got more depressed and at the same time, i found myself getting more and more irritable, my emotions blew up again, i couldn t have arguments without screaming in a rage and hitting myself or my husband, and my anxiety was getting worse to the point of being angry and irritated all the time. instead of going back to the doctor, we found a new one and he pretty much told me that my old doctor was just treating my depression while my bipolar disorder was not in check. so he decreased my wellbutrin to 150mg and gave me back my lamictol and added 25mg of seroquel as a sleep aid. i m happy that this doctor is really trying to fix what the last doctor messed up, but my concern now is that, what if i just have borderline personality disorder instead? someone told me that those people have really intense emotions, which is what i feel now, but i don t want to diagnose myself, when the doctor already told me i have bipolar disorder. i just have a lot of distrust if that makes sense. also this seroquel makes me so drowsy, i sleep 12 hours and all day i feel this grogginess like a zombie almost and i ve only been at 50 mg- 25mg. i feel calm and relaxed but it feels like my body is so slow. so i m just worried that this medicine isn t really for me and just another med that will make me lose my mind. i just don t know what to feel or if i m bipolar or just depressed and all this makes my head spin and feel even more hopeless.",1

"since i was a kid i had access to any forms of media i wanted. especially being from a poor country where piracy is the only way to consume things, i had literally any movie, game, book, tv show, comic etc... at my fingertips, available in 1 second. any single one.and while there is like 10 different other factors that go into my depression and general fucked up life, i have been thinking that this extreme availability and consumption of media is definitely a small part of it.idk what it is exactly, either dopamine burnout or something else. but it is definitely taken a lot of magic out of life. consuming so much for so long made nothing interesting anymore. everything is just boiled down to the bare minimum in my mind, it all seems predictable and repetitive. do you think that one the factors obviously not the main factor of your depression was the excessive consumption and availability of media, the internet, video games?",2

"i am at an age rn where i should have figured out everything.... and i did, but things happened. ocd got triggered and i was given meds that should not have been given to me, strong meds. i stopped feeling anything, any enjoyment from any interests i had, music, movies, books. stopped feeling any empathy for other people, i cannot get into activism without feeling like i am virtue signaling. then on top of that, i started to see synchronicities around me that led me to reading about spiritual awakening and my ocd got triggered again. i feel like every action i do or thoughts i have will lead me to a spiritual awakening. i do not trust my own thoughts, i feel like i have no choice but to leave my old life when i have dreams that i want to get back to, desires that i want to have again. i feel like everything is happening for me to spiritual awaken, did i even will anything to happen? i do not have free will. i also fear therapies and other mental health approaches because they are kind of the same with buddhism practices. anyway, its starting to feel like a self fulfilling prophecy, i cannot describe myself anymore bc idk who i am, or who is spiritual awakening. its everywhere around me, its inside my head. my family is getting tired of me. they belittle everything that i have gone through. if its just ocd then i might be ok with it but i do not have anything to cope with, i do not feel any enjoyment. my life has no quality. then you will read horror stories about anhedonia online. i cannot live like this for 20, 30, 50 years. i do not even know why i should work, when i have nothing to use the money for. i am just so so soooo done with everything. like i do not see anything that makes me want to stay in this world. i might do it once i am alone. i am about to do it.",6

"do your episodes result in physical health problems? i've been battling bipolar for about about 8 years and just recently diagnosed and medicated in the past year and a half. every episode i have results in my thyroid swelling up as a reaction to stress like so big the endocrinologist gasped when he saw it , i have a whole bunch of nodules on my thyroid and now instead of the thyroid swelling up, it's the nodules that are filling with fluid and swelling up....only when i'm at the end of an episode so i know it's due to stress and the endocrinologist agrees. i've also experienced sibo and i still do if i don't follow a strict diet, i became allergic to fragrance, coconut on skin, and aloe vera all out of nowhere, and my hair was falling out, this all happened when i was unmedicated, undiagnosed and extremely stressed out and my anxiety was through the roof. i'm just curious if anyone else has experienced extreme stress from these episodes that's resulted in other illnesses?",1

"ha for two weeks - just discovered what its like hi all so the last two weeks have been a ride for me. i've always had a buildup of wax in my left ear runs in the family . a few weeks ago i noticed a ringing noise in my left ear. i went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection. so i started taking antibios ... didnt go away. so today i went to an ent, who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time 1 week, 1 hour, 1 month ... he said ears take awhile to heal . i had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well. the ringing will go away, just in time. the problem is... throughout the past several days, i spent the majority of my time convincing myself that i had some sort of major illness. the first concern was cancer, then that turned into a meningiti, then that turned into inner ear concerns, then that turned into hiv concerns ... i don't know how i arrived at any of these conclusions. i had no symptoms of any of these illnesses, yet i immediately assumed that i had them. no way do i have meningitis, i would know by now ... no way do i have cancer, it doesnt really run in my family nor do i display any other symptoms. no way do i have aids ... i have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible. my friends and peers are all convinced i have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor. i went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that i have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria. i literally started checking myself every day for things .... lumps, rashes, bruises .... i write because i'm curious to know other people's stories. how do you cope with this? this constant anxiety-driven fear of having a major disease. i've spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses, conditions, symptoms ... trying to connect the dots from anything i could have possibly been exposed to in the past. the slightest itch would terrify me. an ingrown hair on my belt-line convinced me i had an std. in effect, i didn't actually live the past week. my worrying sapped away from my actual living. sorry for the long drawn out rant.",0

"it is going to be a long one. my parents have a tough relationship and i am very used to them quarreling. since when i am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which i witnessed many arguments. although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. my dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually though not easily . i did not realize how have all these affected me until i got into university i am 21 now and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.since i am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that i must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time i disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. an example would be that if my mum and i are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure i know she favors him over me. although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. if i do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and i would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. i hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. very hurting words like ""you should just go die"" ""your dad does not want you anymore"" or ""it is all your fault"" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. probably a few months ago, i found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once i got so irritated i almost cried when a friend is talking to me though i had a long day . i also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. in addition, i also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. it is another question which i always ponder at, whether i am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day then recently, i cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. i just felt like i am being treated like shit for nothing. sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. i could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like ""why do you have to make a big fuss"" ""you did not stand up for me when i was in an argument"", etc. i did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.days after, till today, i still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that i do not know the reason of. i am tired even though i slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. i have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. what is my problem and should i get help? what can i do in the meantime? thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, i hope the grammar is not too bad. thanks all i think i have depression but i am not sure, can anybody help?",2
"things i used to find fun just feel like a chore to do, and boring. i find it exhausting to even get of my seat. i have tried exercising, waking up earlier, eating healthily, meditation and so many other things but no matter what i do i just feel lethargic and even when i think about the future, i do not think ill feel satisfied. also, the career i want is to be a singer, but i have already tried and being a successful singer is almost impossible in this world. there is no other career i want other than being a successful singer, everything else is just un-fulfilling to me to the point that id rather just end my life. i am starting to feel like giving up on being a singer, which means i do not want to live anymore as stupid and childish as it sounds. this is the only career i have ever wanted in my life, but its impossible. i have had a few jobs before but they made me feel like i was wasting my life and i am terrible with social interaction. everything in my life just feels so boring and i used to have high hopes for my future and i used to be a happy person but that was like 5 years ago now. i do not know what to do everything feels boring and the career i want seems impossible",2

"things don t feel quite real. i sometimes get into these fogs of feeling like my life isn t mine or that it s all not real. i have a cold and my partner just handed me nyquil to take before bed, it felt like the pills crumbled or disintegrated in my hands for a split second, i ve seen felt this before in the car when i look at building or the road sometimes for a split second it looks like the buildings or the the world around me crumbles disintegrates kind of like the movie inception if that make sense. i ve been in a mixed episode for almost 5 months and keep get snip bits of this feeling. last year my sister in law essentially took my personal experiences having bipolar and claiming it as their own experience observed from their many behaviors this person shows symptoms of bpd and factitious disorder this kind of fucked with my head a bit. i am someone who constantly tries to make themselves feel guilty, i obsess, and try to convince myself my problems aren t as bad as they seem because i don t want to come off as pretentious or as a victim recently i shared with extended in laws that i have bipolar in the context of the conversation we were having, one of them was a social worker and i had a lovely conservation with her about it that made me feel open and comfortable. however in sharing this i feel like i am coming off as though i m victimizing myself or trying to gain sympathy even though that wasn t my intention . this is making me feel like my experiences aren t real and that i m just pretending to even though i know what my life has been from my memories but i keep questioning if they are real? i keep questioning if anything is real. and i m kind of terrified. it isn t that extreme but maybe it will get worse i don t know i m very confused... anyone ever experience this?",1

"losing my mind over my palpitations... i have had heart palpitations and severe anxiety for the last 6 years. today is my 25th birthday and i am overwhelmed with stress about these palpitations. i m 5 10 and 210lbs, so a tad overweight. i have been to several doctors and a cardiologist over the last 4 years the cardiologist visit was just about 6 months ago and no one can seem to find anything wrong with my heart. my blood tests come back great, my echocardiogram results were immaculate. i even wore an event monitor for a few days and it recorded a few episodes that my cardiologist told me were no cause for concern. but i just can t shake the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with me. i can go weeks or months without noticing a single skipped beat or flutter , and other times like today where i have 10 or more in a day! they scare me. some are very light and feel like a small jolt. others feel like a big flutter or thud and usually make me jerk or gasp. sometimes i feel out of breath from them. i do go the gym every day and never get them while exercising, which is a good thing. i have never fainted or passed out or anything either. they don t hurt. they just scare the crap out of me and i cannot get it through my head that there isn t anything wrong with me.",0

"rant i knew it! my medication is poisoning me! i originally posted this over in the r casualconversation weekly chat thread but upon reflection, realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and i feel i'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what i've been dealing with. from my original post gt it'll be 8 years this summer since i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of depakote epilum sodium valporate for rapid cycling moods and mania. over the years, i've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects i would experience on this drug and every single time, my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant, never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner. gt as a result, i've had to do my own research and recently, i uncovered several side effects that no one told me about gt according to what i've read in numerous articles and medical journals, prolonged long term usage of sodium valporate can apparently cause depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals i've perused, it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. considering that i've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years, this makes sense but no-one told me. no one told me. gt it can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. my pyschiatric doctor the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times i've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 6-8 weekly blood tests has been because i drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not, let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas, which is typically characterized by intense cramping pain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. this makes so much sense considering that all these years i've had near-daily cramping and aches in my abdomen that i always previously thought was due to ibs or my iud being a dick. gt apparently, it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which i have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormones testosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps i often get regardless of what time of the month it is. also, i was at child-bearing age 22 when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst i have no desire to ever procreate, the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so i feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again, no-one told me any of this. gt i am absolutely steaming and yet i just know that if when i raise these issues with my current psych doctor, she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial. gt i know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but i honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that i've learned. i ended up writing a strongly worded but teeth-grittingly ""polite"" letter outlining all these concerns so i can slap her in the face with it- not literally but y'know- and get my voice heard. gt i want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare which is often laughably crap at times here , it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process. gt urgh. i'm so angry i could spit fire!",1

"i am just so tired, been for a while, but i tried at least.. streaming especially helped me feel i was doing something with my life and having a schedule stuff to do helped a lot as well.. but after the previous week with my friend who visited me i am just done really.. with everything.. now that he has left i have been binge eating and drinking alcohol to get drunk on a daily basis as well.. streaming is also gone now, and i doubt anyone cares either.. about streaming or me really.. i am just so weak, have so many issues, i am beaten down over and over and i just cannot handle it anymore. i also seem to have some ""ptsd"" now. anything that feels like a touch including my own clothes at times, or even seeing guys touch girls makes me flinch or freeze up and feel terrible, and i fear guys even more now than before as well, even hearing guys breathe in a certain way now on dramas or movies i watch makes me feel quite unwell.. does not help i am ugly as usual. got called sir at the store today even though my friends tell me i am pretty.. right.. also does not help people keep staring at me like crazy non-stop. my friend confirmed this, so i know it is not just me imagining things.. my age regression stuff does not help either.. wish i got carded for my age, but i look probably 30s or 40s.. have not been carded since i was like 15.. lmao.. myriad of other issues, but bringing them up with nurses, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists does not do anything, or they treat it as if it is a normal thing.. e.g. me mentioning dissociation and i just get applauded for the effort i have done so far based on my own research as usual, sigh.. i tend to learn a lot on my own whenever i need to help someone, can help someone or face my own issues i need to resolve.. had to solve a lot of medical issues this way as well, since the entire system here in denmark has just failed me, or doctors are openly hostile to me because i am a foreigner.. meds for me also never worked, i tried so many and they all ruined me completely. only diet and lifestyle ever worked for me in any way, but can be hard to maintain when you fear going outside and when you spiral one day or friends family make you eat stuff you never eat normally, and then spiral downwards starts.. i get very easily addicted.. already been thinking of various methods and where to go or get stuff, even thinking of a suicide note for the past several days.. as much as i want to say i will admit myself like last year was forced there, though i will not. it would be extremely traumatic to me was quite difficult and make things even worse afterwards.wish the pain would stop, but it is been lifelong and there is no help because i have been pooped on by so many people growing up, and now i am just broken completely, and things just get more difficult as i get older as well, which does not help.. how long am i supposed to wait.. 50 years to maybe get a tiny bit of longer term happiness..?i keep hoping i can get blackout drunk almost at least and end it, but my tummy just refuses to drink that much and i get drunk only.. wish i had someone who understood me, but they do not exist. they simply do not. not someone with as many complex issues as me.. they might have a part here or there that they can relate to, but never even half or a majority of it.. tired amp ruining my life further",6

"i have been browsing through this subreddit for who knows how long, at least a few weeks, maybe a month.i do not think i have ever posted here though, until now.anyway, so stuff has been really shitty at home. i have been living with narcissists all my life, and now that i am 18 things have gotten way worse.to spare you all my life story, my mom is an abusive pos and my grandma and to some extent, my grandpa are enablers of her and are on her side. my mom spread lies about me and used her persuasiveness to get an unknown number of people to believe that she never abused me. or that what she did was not abuse.i have been job searching for 6 months at this point. i have been looking for remote work, due to my location and not wanting to be chained to this area if i want to move, and so i do not leave a paper trail of my earnings etc in case my grandma opens my mail again. i have made about 50 usd freelancing, but finding work is hard and sifting through the shitty posts or the ones that do not relate to my skills is taking a toll. i just want to leave. i am living with my grandparents and my mom recently moved back in. she is just as physically and emotionally abusive as she always was. i cannot stand her.my grandma apparently wants me to pay 400 a month in rent when i can find a job, but for some reason could not tell me that directly and passed the ""dirty work"" on to my mom. i wanted to move out before then, so i do not have to pay to stay here and be tethered to this place.but everything i do fails. i have submitted probably hundreds of resumes to remote jobs, only to never hear back 99 of the time, or get rejected. i am starting to wonder why i even try, when i cannot even take 99 of my belongings with me when i can move without my family trying to get into a legal battle over gifts which are my property and not my mother's. why not just end it and stop my awful contributions to the world so no one has to deal with me again? it is not like i will ever get my dream career anyway. or be who i want to be in life, instead of staying in the closet while i live with my parent like the rest of the relatives i live with do. long time lurker.... first time posting here",6

"hi, i am a 23 year old male. husband and father to a son who just turned 3. i have had depression and anxiety for around 4 years now. i have had suicidal thoughts but never attempted. i am not clinically diagnosed and i have not had any therapy.i was watching my son fall asleep tonight. i was holding his hand as her mother cuddled him to sleep. and then i thought to myself, ""if i did take my own life before, how would i have held this child's hand? how can i watch him grow? how can i love his silly, aptly childish acts that i have grown so fond of if i took my life before this moment?""it made me happy for a bit that i did not take my life but then i was confronted with another reality. ""is it okay for a child as precious as this to have such a broken father like myself? or would it be better if i was gone, out of his life, or out of breath?""thousands of thoughts rained down on the little moment of happiness that i had. maybe if he can see me and the effects of depression as he grows, i can show him how not to fall like me. or maybe if i took my life, he will have the motivation to lead a better life, free of depression.i know i am not a good father. i can only provide his physical needs and not those that he wants. i could not even buy anything for myself. i have an average paying day job with lots of pressures that at times, build up so much that it explodes to the two of them unexpectedly.i cannot afford therapy. i wish i could. and i wish i had real friends that i could talk to. not those who only know me when they need something. maybe i should not have had a child knowing my condition.and now i lie awake in the bed, thinking if i ever fell asleep, will i wake up to his smile again, or would i fall into slumber and take all the negativity away. parenting dilemma",2

"advice the dead sea, saltiest place on earth, second to her. new relationship, and best described as dating a pretzel... twisted, salty and i can't get enough! i'm a 22 y o maori male and have been seeing this choice as lady for a coupley months, she's 30 and deals with type 1. we just started living together, and she has 2 awesome young girls, who also seem to posses the ability of growing horns on command. i don't know how to explain, that i enjoy playing with fire aware of getting burned. the unpredictable is such a turn on, from good vibes present to more energy than a lightning storm. i haven't known her personally for long, but majority of her previous relationships with family and partners has been a path of hardship through physical, mental and spiritual violence... due to their lack of understanding empathy. i'm fortunate to have personal stability, and have so much stength to support this beautiful lady, plenty of time for her daughters, as want to provide them with the guidance and opportunities that, i took for granted in whatever they wish to pursue. it's still early days, and she's a really independent lady, a survivor not a victim, so there aren't labels yet as such, as she struggles with romantic feelings as much as guys. she doesn't take meds, but from previous experience, they bring about a numbness. i strongly identify with spirit natrual alternatives as a maori, not just crazy if anyone has any suggestions? at times she goes really queit, and you can feel the static in the room, i just haven't grasped, how to bring her out of this headspace, as she is so independent and hasn't had a partner that can support and just listen, without anger or wanting to fix everything she keeps quiet. her thought manifests in the environment and is like static electricity. she seems to resolve issues like a male through self reflection, rather than a verbal release. laughter seems to help, so i try change her pattern of thought with humour, but the downside being i dont know what's appropriate at times. last thing i want is to come across as her mother, especially since early days but i'm all about the family values and just here for support. to listen rather than reply, these ears aren't painted on. if anyone has any advise on this situation, dealing with my lady who could make even the devil breakdown on jeremy kyle. would be much appreciated. she's so worth it, without darkness we'd never appreciate how good the light is. nothing worse than a basic b tch, like a challenge.",1

nightmare related to my bipolar disorder i have been extremely manic the past week or so and a few nights ago i experienced a nightmare that really irked me. i get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. it started off with me walking down a street in the city i live in and i could see something up ahead so i started walking towards it. when i got close enough i saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with bipolar written across it. they were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that they re freaks. i started running down the street and i passed two children in a window sewing dolls not sure what that was about but pretty creepy and after that i woke up. overall it was a horrifying dream and i would like to know if anyone else with bipolar disorder has had a nightmare similar to that.,1

"severe anxiety i ll be honest i don t exactly know the point of this post other than i m really really tired of living and feeling the way i am. from ages 8-15 my life was terrible. my family was broken apart and pitted against each other, there was verbal and mental abuse every day, seeking help wasnt an option and it was all made to seem like normal life. 6 years later i m still dealing with it. i know my anxiety and depression originated from my childhood and i know i have realistically nothing to worry about but no matter what i tell myself, what i prove to myself, how hard i work or how happy i try to be it s never enough for me. i have a good job that i am interested in but it has turned into a nightmare. even though i m good at it literally as soon as i get off on my way home i will start having anxiety about potential fuck ups i can make and the work i have to do tomorrow. i ll stress about work at least 50 more times before i clock back in the next day. i mean even when i sit in my car for lunch i start getting anxious. i see my friends maybe once a month due to a lack of motivation or interest in seeing anybody. it takes a long youtube video and about 30 minutes just to tell my brain to stfu and sleep. i dwell on my fuck ups and i m scared shitless of letting people down. i say yes to basically anything anyone asks me to do i actually think i m scared of what people will say or do if i say no . the anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people, going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life. nothing gives me pleasure anymore and i rarely get excited about things. i feel very emotionally numb to everything except stress, fear, worry, and anger. my anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my so. i feel like i care about nothing. i don t find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends, doing the things i love or anything fun. my biggest problem and the main reason i m making this post is that i don t talk to anyone about it. i absolutely hate having to talk about how i feel and what i m thinking, even if it s not about anxiety. all of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. i actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. i m just tired of feeling numb, i m tired of not having fun, i m tired of this emptiness and i m tired of feeling and thinking so many things i don t understand. but this has been my entire life. it s not an on and off thing. it s how i think and how i feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life. im scared that no amount of work, or therapy will fix it because i feel like i basically have to rewire my entire brain and lifestyle.",0

"a letter to me the following is a letter i have written to myself to help me battle intense depression. i write this and add to it when i'm coming from a much better place. if there is one positive thing that has come from this illness it is that the wild variance in mood has helped me gain perspective. dear , here you are again. you've been dragged kicking and screaming into the darkness, the abyss, the place where there is only one way out. you barely eat, lie in bed all day but hardly sleep. ordinary tasks have become insurmountable. even your bed to which you have been bound is no safe haven. ideation and contemplation have reared their ugly heads. clear your mind of these terrible thoughts for now. remember that you have been here before. don't forget what you have learned. depression is not your enemy! you are mistaken. this immense weight you carry with you, though debilitating now, is a blessing in disguise. it is a badge of honor, a shield that covers you from head to toe. take comfort in the fact that you can persevere and survive this as you have done before. and when you leave this place, don't forget to take the shield with you. with it you will find peace in knowing that you withstand anything, because you have been to the worst place imaginable... and survived to write this.",1

"when did you realize your bipolar disorder hit a new level? i was diagnosed at 15 and began my adventures with finding the right medications. i m 32 and i m still on my adventure, as frustrating as that can be sometimes. it was about ten years ago that i hear bipolar disorder is a progressive mental illness. i scoffed at it- i had been at the same level of mental illness from the start. then all of a sudden, three years ago, all hell broke loose. i became insanely manic. i was hallucinating and ocd tendencies came out of nowhere. i was convinced that the planes that crashed into the 9 11 towers were going to crash into my home and the only way to stop them was to lock and unlock and lock my door again. after what felt like forever, that manic phase passed and i had the realization that i had hit a new level of my mental illness. my manic phases have become a monster of their own- i was never nearly this bad before. the lows are deeper, the suicidal thoughts have gotten more frequent though i would never ever follow through- i love my kids too much . everything thing feels so much bigger, if that makes sense. what was now something in the back of my head as a teenager, yeah i have bipolar disorder but i never even think about it, i m too busy living my life. has now become my biggest priority to keep in check and it s almost all i think about. managing my mental health is first and foremost and uncontrollable no matter how much medication i take. has anyone had the same experience? if so, when did you notice your bipolar disorder becoming stronger for lack of better words.",1

"27 yo with severe anxiety living with parents fails at life hey r anxiety, i am in a very tough spot rn, i was working towards becoming a teacher for 7 years, started my teaching certification programme in my country you need to do this , but after 3 weeks i was so anxious of all the people i constantly had to deal with that i started suffering from constant belly pain, diarrhea, insomnia. so after spending 4 weeks on sick leave i decided i want to quit and try to focus on my mental health first and maybe find a small job like a 10 h job in order to be slowly introduced into regular work life while getting support from therapy and social services the 10 h job idea was from my therapist because i havent had a job except for a summer job when i was 18 which was very traumatic because the boss constantly berated me, made fun of me and humiliated me . i still live with my parents who have financially supported me throughout my studies tho till i was 25 my health insurance was free and they got tax benefits and child benefits from me still living with them, if i had moved out i would have been entitled to support by them, my divorced father had to pay me 112 a month for instance and to them me quitting because i just can't work with children and a ton of colleagues and the constant stress of being judged and evaluated and dealing with maladjusted kids supposedly is understandable. however they demand of me to immediately get a full-time or 30 hour job so i can move out asap in potentially a field i have little experience in and they say i shouldnt become unemployed and rely on social services because it would look bad on my cv. because i was struggling to find a field that would interest me within a week of deciding to quit teaching and me offering to apply for a 10 h job at a library smth i wanted to do before but my applications failed sadly as a transitionary period my mother basically screamed daily at me the last couple days saying i should get a job and gtfo and stop acting like a child when i started crying, shaking and feeling like i was about to throw up. she says she is entitled to her financial support paying off after all this time and that i should get a job like a normal person and support myself. as a result of this constant yelling and screaming and ranting i havent been able to sleep for days, i have lost 3 kg of weight, lack any appetite, have to get up every night cus of diarrhea and havent slept more than 3 hours most nights. yday i proposed the idea with the 10 hour job and my mother reacted as if i was telling her a bad joke and said i should be ashamed for even suggesting such a thing. in her rage she said i should gtfo she doesnt care if it's social housing or a homeless shelter and that she didnt financially support me to become a work-shy leech. so in my panic i phoned a bunch of social services just in case so i would know my options. today she came in tears to me and said she was just very concerned about my future. yday i talked to my doctor and my therapist about the potentiality of getting kicked out and they asked if i could go somewhere to get away from this situation so i can recover a bit like i was supposed to during my sick leave, so i decided today to leave for my boyfriend's place who is still a student and also lives with his parents but in a different country we are in eu so travelling is no problem . i have some money left from my teaching job that i could give them if they ask for it i was paying my fam 250 a month from the teacher pay , so i wouldnt be freeloading while i stay there. i have been taking sertraline zoloft for a few weeks now but have had very little success. i have been in therapy since november and been on sick leave since late february. i think if i had stayed i would have become suicidal as i was noticing myself starting to go numb and dissociate whenever i was being yelled at. after explaining my situation to my doctor she said she couldnt let me leave without asking if i have sucidial thoughts because in that case she would have recommended sending me to a clinic. some questions are plagueing me now however... am i a coward? am i doing the right thing? am i a lazy leech like my parents call me or just too mentally ill to work a proper job for now? what do you guys think about my situation am i doing the right thing? what should i have done in your opinion? kind of asking as a reality check",0

"my mother is about to turn 70. she is a widow. through an unfortunate set of circumstances including years of guilt tripping on her part , i have found myself living at home with her again. she is also something of a narcissistic abuser. i understand that this is partly due to her own trauma with her own parents.she broke her arm recently and it gave me a taste of what being her caregiver would be like and i am terrified. she has a plethora of health issues some of which i believe to be exaggerated or that could be mitigated if she would just follow some reasonable health advice , but i know her well enough to know that if she can rely on me to do something, she would do that rather than try to be independent.everything i have read online about being a caregiver talks about how hard it is, but these people also say they would not have traded the experience for the world because of the time they got to spend with their parents. i cannot help but think that these people must have had better relationships with their parents to begin with.i cannot see a way out of it - if i leave, i will never be free of the guilt trips from her and others in her life, unless i cut them off entirely. i hate the thought of her playing the victim and making me out to be a terrible villain for doing what is best for me.if i stay, i do not think i will survive because the thought of it makes me feel like i am suffocating. it makes me feel like my life is over already.i come from the sort of world where suicidal ideation is not taken seriously - it is seen as ""asking for attention"" or ""being manipulative"". saying something like ""the thought of being my mother's caretaker makes me think about suicide"" would not be met with sympathy, but rather with judgement about what a horrible person i ami am not in any danger right now, but i think about suicide and self-harm every day. i may become my mother's caregiver, and i keep thinking that i would rather die",6

i live with my family and i have just gone quiet. i do not talk much about anything because the thoughts on my head do not make for good conversation. i have stopped taking to a lot of people last year bc i felt they were not good friends for me and i was right i just do not have other friends to talk to. i do have one tho i game with but i have trouble talking about feelings with him too. i do not want advice when i talk to someone i guess that is why i do not. i do not want to be told to get out more and talk to strangers because i do not know how to do that. or join clubs bc i already know that is a good way to meet people. but i am just discouraged the people i really like move away and we lose touch and i do not like that many types of people i just constantly listen to podcasts to fill the time when i am working on stuff but myself or gaming. i always feel like an outsider and i think being alone most of the time is making me worse at making friends. i do not even know what to do with friends like to hangout. like if i want to hangout with another new guy friend my age 24 i do not really know what to plan. and i do not really want to do anything either. it feels so weird to try and make friends it feels easier to ask someone out on a date than ask them to hangout as friends. i do not talk,2

"i don t know how to unpack it all at this point i m a 22m, raised in a close knit semi-strict religion, only surrounded by that community. i had a rough childhood with mentally ill parents. i left and traveled around the world at 18 and developed some ptsd from a few situations. i came back, got involved with a very toxic deceptive woman, she had untreated bpd , and this got me outcasted from my religion, which meant all of my friends and family. then her and i broke up the same week, and i ended up homeless for 6 months, isolated. many more situations continued to disturb my life and traumatize me, but now i m no longer in a toxic relationship, but my depression is so bad i don t even have thoughts in my head anymore- only rumination or flashbacks. i don t know how to socialize. i still never hear from my family or all of my old friends anymore. only now have i been able to begin starting over after losing my whole support system, and i don t even know where to start. i m scarred from all relationships, my mood swings, anxiety, and social issues are all over the board. i don t know where to even start.",2

"just venting a bit... hello guys. for the past month or so i ve been dealing with daily stress from thinking i have something. it started out with weakness and fatigue and stomach and stool issues which i attributed to colorectal cancer. after multiple blood tests and ct scans that found nothing, i made the mistake of looking up my symptoms on doctor google and found als. ever since this was early jan i ve been over analyzing every symptom i have and haven t had real peace of mind. it s taken a huge toll on me mentally and i plan to get help. i m the last 3 weeks i ve gone from having twitches all over to burning in my arms to twitching in my hand and now what looks like atrophy in my thenar muscles. i am scared and i just wanted to get it off my chest since my neuro referral won t come for like another month. things i have going for me 1 i am a 23 year old hispanic male and statistically less probable to get the disease 2 my twitches are widespread, which is uncommon in als. only recently have they been in my right hand more focused. 3 the lack of strength i originally felt isn t there anymore, nor am i dropping things or have any strength loss that i can see 4 i have gotten back into the gym and can lift things comfortably and well. 5 no family history of neuro diseases 6 this has been going on for a month without affecting my life other than mentally things i worry about 1 my right hand palm has some visible dents and lines that i feel have gotten more pronounced. this has not resulted in weakness but they seem to have gotten worse. i ve googled a lot of pictures and compared to friends and family and i havent found any that look like mine. all i ve found are clearly atrophied which at that point is completely obvious and don t look like mine. mine look as though i m missing muscle strips and crevices. 2 on the same right hand, the thenar muscles have begun twitching as of 5 days ago. my index finger especially will twitch and jump on its own. also my right thumb hand is less flexible than my left. thanks for reading",0

"cross post with askdocs -- random swelling?? hello, i'm a 23-year-old female, non-smoker, otherwise healthy despite an insane amount of anxiety. i've had slightly swollen lymph nodes on my neck for a while, but doctors i've seen haven't been concerned because i weigh 116 pounds and have a really thin neck -- an ent basically told me to dismiss it unless they actually get bigger. it's only one one side. during my appointment with the ent though, i insisted she check my parotid glands because the left side of my face feels a bit swollen. she agreed, but said it could be caused by a ton of things. my cheek is a bit swollen on the inside, too. it's most notable right under my ear lobe, resting on my jaw. it feels like a lump that's noticeably bigger than the right side of my face. she referred me for an mri with contrast, and suggested i cancel a sonogram i had scheduled because an mri would be better, anyway i did. i haven't had that yet, but i'm really freaked out and wondering if there's anything else i should be concerned with or if i should take her advice to just chill. i've had ulcers on that side of the mouth before 12 at a time, two years ago, apparently caused by stress , i wore clear retainers for two years that could have caused swelling and i had impacted wisdom teeth removed 8 months ago. they were more impacted on that side of my mouth. i'm not sure what to do, just wondering if i'm going crazy or if i'm right to be concerned. also, i'm more short of breath lately not like, short of breath in a way where i'm sweaty and my heart's beating fast. short of breath like my throat feels tight. but that could be caused by anxiety, too. thanks for you help.",0

"warningis this a manic episode? please help x-post r bipolar i've been diagnosed with bipolar by three different psychiatrists. i kept asking for different opinions because i thought i was ""simply"" afflicted with major depression on and off, for about a decade! . i've finally accepted the diagnosis and started the treatment, but the pills that the doctor prescribed are exclusively to treat symptoms of depression in patients with bipolar disease lamictal . for the past 5 days, however, i've been experiencing something very different some of my thoughts seem foreign to me, in the sense that i know they don't make sense, but i am still drawn to consumed by them. i do and say things that are completely outrageous. even though i am perfectly aware that they are outrageous, i somehow can't stop myself. it's very easy to trigger my irritability. i am screaming loudly and aggressively, and using profanity at the slightest of provocations. i am vicariously living some fantasies. when i say vicariously, i mean that i am having extreme reactions of nostalgia over things that never happened fake memories . it's strange in the sense that i know they are fake but, at the same time, i believe them? my head is a big mess. i don't have any answers. when i'm depressed, none of this happens. right now, i feel like i have more than one person inside my head. there is the rational side, the side that is aware that something is off, the side that is writing this. and then there is the unbalanced side, the side that is causing all this havoc. the only thing that seems to help is to go clubbing, or to a place with a lot of noise. it somehow makes my thoughts more clear and leaves me more relaxed even without the help of alcohol . has anyone experienced any of these things? i am scared, but i end up driving away everyone that tries to offer their help.",1

i woke up today and after feeling slightly better for maybe six months i got a letter in the mail my insurance company is reevaluating my claim for long-term disability. i feel like i just went through their evaluation by other mds a year ago and now they sent a whole package of information for me and my doctor to complete. i am so tired of being in pain everyday and struggling to get through a regular non-work day. i lost my job because of mental and physical health and there is nothing to go back to. how can they do this evaluation again? what if my doctors do not say the correct things on the forms. what if my psychiatrist retires next year? i am shaking with fear because the only way i am surviving is on disability and i was ready to end my life before they took me out of work. i just cannot do it. i am so tired and afraid. i am shaking with fear and dread. i cannot feel this way again. insurance reevaluating disability - any experiences or help?,2

"hi. so a bit of background.my dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. when my mum had me 21 , she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. my mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. this is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but i reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.his relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. he would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. essentially as i grew up, i became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. he took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. one time when i was 14, i went to the wrong street for him to pick me up one street over and as soon as i got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face i hate you, i fucking hate you. he would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. i have not had anything like that recently with him, but i do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. overall, i very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and i, that he wishes life could have been different.he has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. he has maybe three friends? but he only sees them at work.i have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. for a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. my mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked mental breakdown? but he was fine the next day. i did not say anything because i was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. the only person i would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. my mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what i should do when he dies, get everything in order. i said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if i am here next week. he then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. i am terrified. i think hes going to do it. i love him so much please help me here. i do not know how to help him. i do not even know if i am overreacting or what. what should i do. i think my dad might kill himself",6

"therapy is so expensive, and it is completely unpredictable if the therapist will even be able to healthily provide for your needs and personality. i had a therapist who was shit, she rambled too much about her own life and gave me toxic advice. but i thought that there was no way out, and three year later i am still struggling. everyone tells you to go to therapy as if its free, even i have done that at times. every time i crave the thought of therapy and feel like i desperately need it, i think about the price, and i am immediately pulled off. i want to go to therapy, but the price feels like an obstacle that you need to constantly pass.i get that people have to make livelihoods, but i have to pay more than quadruple what my age group can make in an hour to just talk about my feelings and for them to tell me stuff i already know. when people say that money does not make happiness, think about therapy. i have done hours of research trying to find a cheaper therapist, but the cheapest i found is like 35. why does therapy cost so much, but the advice to do it is thrown everywhere?",2

"so tired of being the person laughed at and not taken seriously. i'm a bit of an introvert but through the years i learned to appear social and outgoing with people. in most contexts it's positive and useful. but in others things turn out terribly for an actually shy and introvert person. i sometimes make jokes about memes, funny videos, etc. it's a good way to engage with other people at work for example. rest of the people do the same. it's not that i'm joking more than the rest of the people. i never make jokes about the others, i'm very respectful. i even avoid any joke or meme that might be hurtful to other people. yet there's always a moment where people go from laughing with me to laughing at me. for example, now people at work make fun about my poor diet. i never detailed anything about what i eat, or if i had time to cook. and some of those people bring canned food. or about some of my habits. when stuff like this starts happening, i feel really hurt. it's like i thought for a long time i was sharing funny moments with workmates, and actually everybody was clowning me. there are some ridiculous things about me. my voice is high pitched and soft for a man my age 37 and that would be a main thing. i'm gay and that makes it even more obvious, but i don't talk about my sexuality since it's private. i wonder if these aspects make me the target of getting laughed at when actually i'm being friendly like the others. however i no longer care. once i get fed up with all this, i avoid any unnecessary socialization with people who hurt me. i would consider to say what i wrote here in a polite way, but it's impossible to do that without being looked like a dramatic person. so i've decided to not eat again with this people, just go outside or stay on my own. not the first time it happens to me, but the first where i can just avoid it easily. i don't know why i trust people again and again. i know people are not evil per se, but other people can really be hell for depressed persons like me.",2

"life has left me hopeless. first, thank you for reading my rant, even if you don't make it to the end... life advice please... 30f, relationship with 31m, anf we have a 9mo son. we lost the home we were renting back in dec, due to mold. we've been back and forth between the in-laws since. i'm in school and he is looking for work, but also is waiting for his bar exam results. i can't stand living with other people. i'm currently dealing with my mental health bipolar and adhd and it's hard to function at times. the other day i was overwhelmed by my mil who wanted us to bring the baby over to meet some family last minute. that ended with me yelling at her when she came to the car wanting to take my son out because he was crying. i told her to worry about her children, not mine. this morning at 6am, i woke up to find my partner in his parents room talking. when he came back he stated ""it's me amp you"" over and over. later, he explained how no one will understand me or my bipolar and how much weight i carry and how hard it can get for me on a daily basis. he didn't go into full details of the convo because i'm an overthinker, but him stating his parents asking if i'm in therapy or taking medications, made it obvious. that's when my partner got upset because he saw how i consistently have to deal with our families not understanding. as i told him, not many ever will. i hate living with the in-laws. i love them, but i don't do well with the mil always home. having someone consistently there and always watching what's being done with my son, being there to greet him all the time, or making opinions like ""he's hungry, he wants milk, look at this, look at that"" etc has really been getting on my nerves. to the point that now i can't stand her voice or go into a negative mood when i know she's going to be around. my partner and i both feel uncomfortable staying at each others parents. financially we are unstable at the moment and were trying to figure out what our next move is... when my son was born, the first two weeks, we got covid. then, after 6 months of living alone, we lose our home to mold. during christmas, i went through a perfect storm of depression with losing the house and overwhelmed by everyone wanting to meet my son. i feel like his first year was one of the hardrst for me and i want to be able to enjoy these 3 months before he turns a year, but it's been so hard... so! any advice? any recommendations on work from home? any knowledge regarding starting a dropshipping business to earn an income? i need to do something because i can't keep living thi way. this is the most i've thought about suicide and that's not fair to me or my son! i'm looking for any avenue to be able to provide for my son. i miss having our own home and i miss alone time with my boys and i miss being content and feeling some happiness... help!",1

why did i have to be born into an abusive household. i am done pretending i have had a great childhood my father was a prick shit fuck and left me with issues that caused me to never have friends and he gets away with it. he left the fucking country so he does not need to pay child support so we everyday struggle for money. and when i feel like everything is going well i get reminded that we had touched me a little boy whenever my mum was out and my sister never helped. what the fuck did i do wrong? i try being there for others but because of how i behaved in school people hated me. i just wanted to be noticed or to have some little power in my life for once. i ended up leaving school too early and was dumped by the education system as they did not want to help.not that anything matters now i just need to vent typing this out helps in a bizarre unusual way. i am too worried to go to therapy. i was under cahms when i was younger and all they did was worsened things and betrayed me so therapy is possibly worse. i do not want to be diagnosed with anything i just want to believe i am normal?. i had a girlfriend for a year believe it or not i still wonder how. does not matter she used me and cheated on me because again i must deserve this for no particular reason. i am done venting now sorry for that. why me?,2
"i was doing so well for so long. i was on top of the world for months, even shitty things were not getting me down like they used to spiralling . everything for the first time in a while was working out for me had my life back on track, felt normal for a while. ran out of money for my meds so i had to stop taking them. obviously big mistake but even then felt fine for a month or so. now shit started to fall apart the constant anxiety came back, lost a job i was really trying my hardest in and the boss who fired me just confirmed everything i have my depression and anxiety has been telling me for years. now i am back to feeling like no matter how hard i ever fucking try i am never going to be good enough. always going to be a freak, i try so hard to fit in and i just cannot. i have tried being myself and then i say weird shit. i try mirroring their personality and then myself slips through and they think i am freak again i just know it. people ignore me when i speak, i am the only one ever trying to arrange things to see my friends. i just cannot ever do things right and i am so so tired of constantly getting myself through the day pushing it all to the back of my mind and then i am alone at night and alls i want to do is just cry and hurt myself. and it makes me feel so weak because a normal person would be over a bad firing by now. a normal person would not have to try so hard to be liked. and i have no one to tell bcus everytime i do i regret it an hour later and they care for a day and then they of course have to get back to their lives bcus i am a grown ass adult and should know how to do these things on my own. even the benzos do not help with the attacks anymore. i am just so tired.where do i go from here? was doing so well for so long",2

i have been doing relatively well for the past few weeks and socializing more. some days are better than others but today i am convinced that people hate me and try to avoid me. insecurities take over and i interpret everything in my own self loathing self sabotaging perspective. it could be as simple as a less than enthusiastic text answer from a friend. how do you handle that? days like these,2
"please help! hey guys, i have an on-site interview after being a complete depressed, socially angst hermit for the last 6 months. when i say i didn t go out of my house more than 4 times in 6 months, best believe it i applied for a job and i have to fly to another state for it. i thought things were getting better with me but my anxiety is through the roof just thinking about the travel, but mostly the interview. it s a 2hour session from 10-12pm. i usually take 10 mg of propranolol, but i don t think it ll be enough. do you guys think it s ok to take 20mg. before you ask me to ask my doctor, he said i should take 10-20 mg but i have never taken 20 mg before and i am scared i ll pass out or i won t be able to breath had asthma when i was younger . i was thinking maybe of taking one at 8am and then another at 9.30am-ish. what do you guys think? anyone with experience? also i m a little female despite being in my mid 30s . 5 feet and 110lbs",0
"health anxiety phobias i had posted this in the general anxiety sub, someone pointed me to this sub in the comments so i'm cross-posting here i'm new here. i've suffered with anxiety for as long as i can remember, but it took an existential crisis for me to seek treatment about 10 years ago. i've been medicated ever since. the meds definitely help me feel more ""normal"", but i'm never 100 without anxiety. it's still always there. i have some chronic health problems, and after suffering for years see a pattern here? i have finally gotten up the nerve to try to figure out what is wrong. for years i've told myself my symptoms are just anxiety related ibs, body pain, fatigue, extreme migraines, etc. it has now gotten to the point where i'm sick more often than not, i'm missing a lot of work and i'm not able to be a good mother or wife. i'm spending most of my time in the fetal position in bed. i'm in pain all of the time, sometimes so severe i can barely move. i'm losing weight without trying. i feel like i'm losing my grip on reality. the problem is, i am really freaked out by doctors and all the associated medical tests procedures. i have a gp who handles my anxiety meds, and i see her regularly, but i am awful at getting tests done and awful at seeing specialists .... even though i know logically that i need to go do these things to find out what is wrong with me so i can get better. in a moment of bravery, i made myself appointments with all of the specialists i've been told to see over the years... gastroenterologist, neurologist, rheumatologist, dentist and oral surgeon. i've gone to a couple of the appts and of course all of them want me to get tests done or bloodwork done. i feel paralyzed when i think about getting those things done. for example, i have orders for bloodwork. i just have to walk into the lab and let them draw blood.... super easy and no big deal. i have driven myself there 5 times in the last week and been unable to force myself to walk through the door to get it done. i break out in a sweat, panic, and get back in the car and leave. then i spend the rest of the day hating myself for it. feeling like an idiot because i didn't get it done. my gi doctor also ordered an ultrasound, which i forced myself to do i've had two kids and knew us were easy, so this didn't freak me out as much . however, she called me back to tell me that my us results are abnormal and that they might need to do a biopsy... so of course now i am absolutely freaking out. does anyone else have this problem? i feel paralyzed and terrified over the simplest things and hate myself for it. i need to stop being such a coward and get this stuff done so i can figure out why i am so sick and try to fix it.",0

"reasonable accommodation frustration. to start off with i have a few different mental health disabilities. i am fortune that i am employed full time! i am also ""out"" about having a severe and persistent mental illness at work. however being in my office causes me some issues in being easily distracted by things going on around me. my disability causes some executive function deficits, along with hyper arosal awareness... not the sexy kind this summer my 5 year old was diagnosed with two chronic, incurable autoimmune diseases. this of course has made mental health stuff worse. i was lucky to be in a dbt program when it happened or i'd be in a horrible spiral right now. i knew it would effect my performance and i asked my direct supervisor, and manager about working from home 8 to 16 hours a week as an accommodation. at previous jobs this has been heart for keeping me up to date in notes. i was told that as an orginzation we do not have a policy for this. i said fuck it, and worked from home anyways making sure i didn't go over my hours and got caught up. woo! over the fall we had a lot of staffing changes and i wound up with double the work load for 3 months. i have stopped working from home becuse i was worried in would get caught and get sacked. my performance has suffered and my new supervisor has noticed. i again went to my supervisor and director and was told the same thing about their being no policy allowing us to work from home. so i went to hr, with documentation from my care provider. hr just now got back to me, after a month. again they implied they where but didn't out right denying the request. i've been in contact with an ada specialist in my state, along with askjan about this and it's super frustrating. the best worst and most ironic part of all of this? our orginzation serves people with disabilities. this is what we do for them and teach them what to do. how to obtain and maintain emoloyment. my caseload is only people, like me, who have a serious or sevre and persistent mental illness. ain't that some shit? i love the people i serve, and what i do and this is really leaving a sour taste in my mouth about the orgization. if you read this whole thing... thank you for listening. i am so frustrated with the situation and i'm not gonna give up this fight.",1

"lost and depressed i'm 21 yo and i'm tired of what i'm studying computer science , i don't find it interesting that much, i find it stressful and the job market is extremely competitive. there is just so much fcking information to learn in cs it's absolutely crazy when people say that you always have to learn in this field they weren't joking. most of the material i will just forget quickly after a semester. luckily i am in community college so i haven't spent really any money on this degree but i have spent a shit ton of time on it tho. despite all that time spent already, i feel like it won't help me that much if i don't start to seriously study more but i just can't bring myself to. i don't really know what i want to do with my life but i do kinda like my job in retail even though for many people it seems like a shitty job and it kinda is but at least it's an easy job without too much stress tbh. night shifts are the best because there are no managers so i sometimes just chill after finishing my tasks for like an hour. i can even come in high and do my job easily. but there really is a social pressure to do something better with your life and i get it i really kinda don't want to do this forever but at the same time even if i somehow get a job in my field i feel like this field would just be too stressful for me. i have thought of other options than retail that don't require a degree but i just can't try getting into them because i have to finish this degree first since i only have a bit left before finishing.",2

"advice on treatment options? i ve been dealing with depression since i was a teenager. i had a suicide attempt in high school, had to be committed to a psychiatric hospital for a couple weeks which was highly traumatic and was on i believe zoloft for a few months until i moved to self medicating with alcohol and realized that the 2 don t mix well. i ve seen multiple therapists, but i have a very hard time being honest and open and i ve had therapists outright drop me as a client because i wasn t making progress. also when i was drinking heavily it was hard to make appointments so i stopped going. i ve come a very long way from this. i very rarely drink now, but i never went back to therapy or medication. i cope by staying extremely busy but i struggle on the weekends when i have less to occupy myself with. i feel like i need something to help. i m unsure about meds because even before i could never find a dosage that helped and i don t know if i want to start that process over again. and i also now have a masters in psychology and i have enough insight into myself to be able to understand my behavior. so i don t think a therapist can do anything for me that i can t do for myself, and i doubt that i can be completely open. idk what i m looking for, i guess just advice if i should try to get treatment, if it would be worth it.",2

"self-diagnosis for this, what do you think? obviously i think therapy is extremely important this, but i also think it's one of those things that can be self-diagnosed. with the age of the internet, it's easy to get into the mode of self-diagnosis, whether it be for physical or mental illness. but, i feel emotionally struck by this, it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable, it strikes me to the core and i don't want it to. i don't want this to be the reality, but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. i'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth, but i've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which i may not, but it fits so well. beyond on the symptoms, i've dung into the roots, the commo thought patterns, behaviors, etc. it's not something i feel will pull me down or become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as painful as it's been to learn about, it's something i feel refreshed by, in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. i thought i was self aware before, but i had a lot of false beliefs and i also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors.",4
"at one point i was having fun doing these things. its true that robotics competition taught me useful skills like how to code and build, but i was more obsessed with actually winning than learning. unfortunately for younger me, school teams coaches were focused on ensuring every student learned something and i never had teammates that were super passionate about winning the competition. in hindsight, its not like winning really mattered anyway. now for video games, i do not think playing them is bad until you start playing them to avoid your problems in real life or with the dream to go pro in some esport title. i wish i had realized that before i spent thousands of hours alone in front of the screen honing my skills. i never actually stuck to the same game either, i just played whatever was trending at my school during the time. i suppose i was the best there at competitive, but that is a pretty meaningless title. compared to the rest of the country i am nothing.i used anime tv and youtube as a means to escape reality as well. i did not make new friends in high school and would watch stuff for 3-4 hours a day while maintaining my grades so my parents would not kill me i tried to be a youtuber streamer just like every other internet kid but that takes talent and effort over timei also spent a lot of time trying being a game dev but i lacked the skill. i had a little success trading on steam but i still consider that time wasted because its not a very useful skill.i did manage to lose weight and get in better shape and got into a good computer science program but i have lost my passion for programming and math. its just become a thing i do at this point. i have started to have binge eating episodes and currently am on medication. it seems to have numbed my feelings. i occasionally feel intense despair and hunger but that is about it, usually i feel nothing.i have been to counseling but i just do not care enough to go anymore, what more can they do than say everyone makes mistakes. you are still so young and can make a ton of friends in college. do not compare yourself to others. what even is a friend anyway? also do not really have a great relationship with my parents if you have not guessed alreadyi do not have any skills that can get me paid other than programming. i hope i start enjoying it again soon. i am interested in entrepreneurship but its not the most safe thing to pursuetl dr i wish i was more productive and social as a kid instead of a loner that grinded pointless tasks. also lost passion for current major but too afraid to switch. feels like i am headed for a boring life. m18 i feel like i wasted an unhealthy amount of my childhood doing things that stopped being fun and do not provide any value video games, competitive robotics, and watching youtube tv anime",2

"i have no other options but to go on anti depressants. i have been suffering with chronic depression since i was 12. i am 22 in september. i have gone through sexual assault and developed ptsd bc of it. i also have a severe ridiculous anxiety disorder plus a history with anorexia and other eating disorders. through all this time i have tried everything to pull myself out of the shithole, i went through a period of time where i was addicted to hard exercise, i spend a lot of time pouring time into my career which is my life long passion, have been going tk therapy for a year and a half. last year things got so bad for me and i felt so deeply alone that i got myself a puppy. right now she is the only reason i go outside and get 10 thousand steps daily. i really was hoping that my pup could make me feel less lonely, but she is actually quite detached. in her 7 months of life i have never been able to cuddle with her - she does not like it, and i am not going to force her. she tends to gravitate to my mother much more despite the fact that i am the person who feeds her, walks her, trains her and generally takes care of her hygiene. i have realized recently that this might be because i am filled with nothing but negative, putrid energy, which makes sense how a young pup might not want to be around me. i still love her deeply but yet again i have reached another disappointment where i just keep being a problem.the only reason i refuse to go on medication is because i do not want to gain weight as a result, i know not all medicines do this, but most will do it. my self esteem is already below hell and if my eating disorder is triggered i might actually kms. its stupid, but i just refuse. i hate being alive. this is stupid",2

"i am tired. it is the same routine everyday. over and over again.i used to be a morning person before the pandemic happened. now i feel like a zombie waking up every morning. my mom wakes me up every morning, but never with a ""good morning"". it is always ""you are never studying"" or ""wake up you lazy ass"". cannot she, for once, notice that i am consumed by dark thoughts and sadness? i would not say i am depressed, because i am not clinically diagnosed . yesterday, after my online class, i was having an existential crisis and just lying in bed crying the fuck out into my pillow. i am pretty sure my mom heard me crying, and chose not to ask me about it. and while i like to be left alone when i am having breakdowns, it would really have helped me if my mom had comforted me. instead, she chooses to always call me lazy. i am so sick of this. online classes suck, but that is a whole another story for another post. i just feel really really suicidal right now. there is nothing left to live for. my life is not going like i would imagined it. what is going to happen? should i really keep going? when i am actually contemplating suicide, i realize i want to hold on a little bit longer. that is when i realize i do not want to die, i just want to live. i am so tired of everything",6

i only realized this was a stupid idea in my freshman year of college when i started having flashbacks. i tried once more to do therapy and almost failed out of school. again i buried it all to be dealt with at a more convenient time. i have now been working in a job that don't mind for the last year and 3 months. i found that november and december were a struggle and because of that i planned to address my stuff by going to therapy starting in 2019.,5

"been so anxious lately and now my friend is mad at me i m currently in my second semester of college and lately my anxiety has been sky high. i m currently on 2 medications buspirone propranolol. my friend is aware of my anxiety and noticed that this week it has been particularly high. anyways today i went a bit mute, i can t find the energy to talk and it s hard to communicate how i m feeling. so today in lab, my friend was getting frustrated because she was hungry from not eating all day. and when lab was over, i kind of rushed out because i felt a panic attack going on. i went to the bathroom to put cold water on my face. she got angry at me, texting me saying where the fuck are you? and when she found me she sat there with a look on her face. i told her she can go to the dining hall but instead she went back to the lab classroom and started to talk shit about me to our lab partner. so now i m currently sitting here too afraid to even talk to anyone, i just wish i could get rid of this. i hate feeling this way and making everyone around me upset.",0

"hello, my name is lucas, i have been dealing with depression for quite a few years now, i am 23 turning 24 in september. i feel like my life is just going further and further down hill, recently its been a 90 downward fall. i am heavily invested in computers and i love playing games, sometimes it feels like my pc is the only thing i have left in this world, also because i am able to live in another reality for as long as my eyes are locked on to this screen. i do not feel like going outside, i barely speak back when spoken to that is my own choice, for some reason. my mother has a rare heart condition called ""alcapa"". she has had 6 heart attacks and i have been a witness to multiple heart attacks she is had... it is the freakiest scariest thing i have ever seen, i truly believe witnessing your own mothers quote on quote death, multiple times, fucks with you hardcore. its a constant thought. i did not go to school for almost a year after it happened.. and that set me way back in school, so when i came back i knew nothing and i felt stupid. so i ended up being the ""funny stupid"" guy in class, making jokes at the teachers and being sent to the principals office many maaaaany times. i never got good grades and that shit is hurting me so much right now, not being able to get a ""decent"" job.a few years after it was discovered that my mother had ""alcapa"" my dad left us all to start a new family, at 48. since i was the oldest at the time, i took on a kind of a ""father role"" at 16 years old. i have tried reaching out, but he does not really care. so i have stopped reaching out and making myself look stupid, i will not ever lay my eyes upon that vile human being again.when i was 20, i went to help one of my grandfathers friends paint he is house. we had a few beers at dinner and i decided to sleep there for the night, in the guest room. i woke up early in the morning and this guy was sitting on the side of my bed and had he is hand in my boxers. i freaked out, called my mother and my little brother. we called the cops and took him to court. i cannot begin to explain to you, how this ruins the way you look at yourself. you feel de-humanized and it feels like your masculinity is taken away from you aswell as all of your dignity. i am heterosexual .after that happened i could barely look myself in the eyes when i stood in front of a mirror i still barely cannot . i used to be muscular, like.. very. but it is all gone, i look like sticks now. my cheeks are inflated, and i look like a skeleton. when i look at myself i see a disgusting 23 year old who is 167 centimeters, still looks like a kid and cannot grow a beard. i cannot even go to the store and buy cigarettes without someone who is obviously younger then me asking for id.i had a job 5 months ago. i made good money and it made me happy for a month, my first pay was amazing. but after that the job turned dull and extremely difficult and hard, they did not have appropiate equipment for carrying heavy stuff, we broke rules to almost break our own backs. i came home with pain in my back everyday and yellow and blue marks all over my arms. i had the job for about 3 months and then i got fired, because my ""boss"" told me i was not working hard enough. it made me snap and i said stuff i should not have, but whatever. i am happy i am done with that work, but it really shocked me that people look at me like i am not doing anything, when i really am putting in as much hard work as i can.i owe companies money at 23. i have taken small loans that have evolved into large amounts now.i have had a feeling my life would be short, ever since i was 14-15 years old, i do not know how to deal with this. the thought of suicide has crossed my mind over 1000 times, but i do not have the guts to go through with something like that. that is why i have fallen closer to the natural ""death"" side of things. i barely eat anything anymore, like, maybe a banana or something a day, because the pain in my stomach is too much sometimes and i have started smoking alot more cigarettes, just ""because"".i want help, but i will not ask for it. i have quit over 13 cigarettes on my own arm, it hurts and i do not like it, but i hope some day someone will notice my burn marks and ask what is wrong. i probably will not tell them what is wrong and i have been thinking about it alot. i feel like i am doing it for attention and i am not an attention seeker useually. i useually love just being overlooked. i am so confused! i want this off my chest.. thanks.",2

"hello. r depression expect some incoherence, here. i have had a 40. i will try and cover all the bases career, love, relationships in general, self-esteem worth. i will be 40, this year. i am graduating with a worthless bachelor's in cis this month. i recently moved to be closer with and provide a home for my daughter who is in the military. my boss loves me, my boss's boss loves me. my daughter loves me. i tried going on betterhelp but, it is too expensive. i am intelligent, articulate, and charismatic. i am also, probably suffering from cptsd...maybe...without a real diagnosis, you have to calculate these things indirectly kind of like an astronomer measures the distance between stars. so if we measure all the ""giftedness"" i had as a child and compare that to the actual output, setbacks, and emotional outbursts i have had in adulthood we can, maybe, probably say i am guessing the right sport...even if i am not in the ballpark. anyways, i used to feel something. i used to have euphoria almost everyday. i was working out and eating healthy. i was attractive and i had a sex drive. i felt hopeful and motivated. i had a much stronger sense of self worth pursuing my degree than i feel on the verge of achieving it. the key, back then, was that i had a sense of purpose. i felt that the world wanted me, even needed me and that i would offer up my contribution as a good and kind friend, as a supportive coworker, as a loving and kind mother, as an educated and ""gifted"" woman.i do not feel hope. my dumb ass pursued work in a field that is demand is decreasing. i am alone in a city and state that i abhor. i am too old to seek out friends and i have been alone for so long that i am just fucking weird in public. at least, i feel that way. what is worse is, in spite of feeling sadness, i feel hollow. i am sad because i do not feel the actual sadness. i never understood how people become entitled ""incels"" how they will not just get in the problem and do the emotional work and the physical work to get themselves out of their heads. well, i think i know why, now. sometimes, some people do not have access to their creative reasoning. some people do not have access to their visual mind and literally cannot see a way. some people cannot access the core emotion that drives them and pushes them to move forward. i have, somehow, become one of those people. i feel owed something for all my years of work. i am creeping ever closer to my sense of insignificance in this world how plain an lackluster i truly am and i am acting out in stupid, uppity ways. i drink nearly every day. i used to drink occasionally in a year. i want to take up smoking again. addictions used to scare me but, with the ever increasing sense of doom and hopelessness i have, any dirty spot under a bridge somewhere, homeless and single minded, feels like the right space to be in. tomorrow, i am going to do a thing that is always worked for me in the past. i am going to make myself suffer. i am going to cut off youtube, reddit, and facebook. i am going to wake up early and exercise and study and read and force the world into slow motion. i am going to let go of the beer and sugar and flood my body with veggies all day. i am going to meditate. i am going to relinquish my idea of who i am and what i am worth and set long term goals but, force myself to have short sight that only encompasses being in this moment doing as much as i possibly can to exceed my own expectations. this used to work. it has worked every single time in the past. i hope i have not squeezed the magic out of it by allowing myself to repeat this cycle. no one owes me anything. i do not owe anybody anything. i am curious to know what i am capable of and what i look like as my very best version of myself this takes embracing every moment with enthusiasm and without judgement. if i were the best version of myself i would take the energy i use to fight moments i am not comfortable with and use it to express some greatness from within. i should not wish for good days. i should strive to be good to my day. so, now that i have spoken to a bunch of strangers who probably will not read this goddamn mess. i have a sense of how to go about this. thank you reddit for having this thread. i know i have broken a rule because i have not really asked for anything but, i mean...i kind of just am asking to be witnessed. i think. would you please be a witness to this terribly painful moment in my life? feel nothing's worse than feeling misery",2

"i have tried before, failed. spent a week or so in a mental hospital while on active duty, ostracized and shit on by my ex wife while i was in the hospital. my whole life i had to watch my own back, growing up extremely poor in ghettos and around abusive people hoping my father would swoop in and save me one day but that never happened. sexually abused by someone i thought i could trust when i was in grade school, i still cannot remember all the details because my brain will not let me, at least that is what my therapist explained to me and idk if that is good or bad. gave my life and all of my love to my ex wife, only to have constant infidelity while on deployment but i still loved her, she facetimed me on my last deployment.... of her viciously punching her womb while in the 2nd trimester with our child. i had to watch her kill our child while trying to beg her to stop, then offer sympathy to her when i found out the kid was officially lost, but i was still the bad person. i would let her beat on me because i thought it was the right thing to take it like a man. my career was flushed because i tried to give her everything, i was damn good at my job too. i forgot how to function and began drinking a lot. i have failed at everything i tried to do in my life, if not at first a bit later. i was in therapy while still in, but after i got out that all went down the drain. its been almost 2 years since i separated and i look nothing like i used to, a pile of sweaty shit that did not do anything but drink and get high to numb myself. i have been sober for a couple weeks which i should be proud of but now i think about offing myself even more. 9mm to my temple, easy off switch. the only reason i saw fit to keep living was to take care of my grandmother, but she is ok now and does not need me anymore. my mother died last october on her birthday, she froze to death in her own apartment. i was ignoring her because i could not handle her mental issues, what kind of piece of shit does that. she needed me. i am a jobless pos that does not know how to function in society, and i do not think i could ever handle a relationship again. i do not know who to talk to that would believe all of this and not look at me like yeah, okay buddy. i am not even sure why i am writing this. i hate myself more for whining about my problems. i am so tired of pretending to happy.. my thoughts and talking about my issues makes me feel like a crazy person, reality at times seems permanently warped, sometimes i feel like i succeeded and i am just living in some sort of fucked up purgatory. i have never been good enough for anyone, just a waste of space. the stuff anyone likes about me is a lie because i am pretending to be happy. just a washed up pos vet, i do not feel deserving of that title either. this post is all over the place and i have no idea what i am trying to say or why i am even doing it. what is the fucking point of living, i have nothing meaningful to offer to anyone. i wish someone would kill me so my family would not have to deal with the memory of me doing it to myself. i am tired of living with my memories, so much fucked up shit i can never escape. but i do have signs of liver failure so hopefully that pans out and ends up killing me soon. it seems like just a matter of time.",6

"rabies anxiety i ve had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently i ve been concerned about rabies. about ten days ago i let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and i caught her hissing at what i think is a neighbor s cat that had jumped over the fence. i didn t want them to get in a fight so i shoo d the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. after about ten minutes i picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. i know that my cat is vaccinated she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 1 2 years ago and the neighbor cat was not rabid. i know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the us. i know that i m being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesn t help. i keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. it doesn t help that i woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that i ve been having nightmares where i loose my mind and become aggressive. i m not sure exactly what to do about this or what this post is supposed to do. i m on lexapro for general anxiety and ocd tendencies. i guess i just want to be told i m a healthy idiot.",0

"title, basically. i am kind of terrified. i have completely lost entire conversations, and looking back on those conversations the ones i can actually read because they happened over text it seems like someone else wrote them. they include details i do not know literally until i read them, and leave out things that i now do.i can never remember my best friend's major. it is engineering, i think, but which sort? i have no idea. i have asked him about it dozens of times, i know that much.friends are always introducing me to music. a few months later, i will invariably try to introduce them to the same music as if the first conversation never happened.i recently broke up with my partner. part of why i did was because i felt he was an awful communicator. then it came to my attention, through both him and other people who were close to the situation, that i actually just straight-up forgot a great deal of our communication on a few key issues. i remember it now, but i do not know if it will stay that way.i am an active member on a worldbuilding forum elsewhere on the internet, or at least i used to be. looking back at what i wrote there, it feels so... foreign, again, like someone else wrote it.i can never remember my childhood as clearly as my sibling. they can recite to me all kinds of things about family gatherings, semi-distant relatives, and various other memories that i have absolutely no connection to.i am horrible with names. i used to think that it was normal, but now i am questioning that assumption in light of everything else.i am currently visiting with a friend. planning logistics for this trip has been an incredible hassle, because i have thought that we discussed things that we never had a conversation about, and entirely forgotten conversations that did happen.i can never remember the tasks i need to complete. i always thought that it was laziness, or my capacity for straight-up denial, but i am not so sure at this point.everyone-- everyone --that knows me, apparently knows me to be very repetitive in conversation, far more so over the course of a day. i had no idea. i always think it is my first time saying something until someone tells me otherwise. i always thought nothing of it, but...this is an awful revelation. i feel like i am going crazy, like i do not know what is actually real in my life or what looks real just because i am missing some key detail. i am afraid that i have forgotten so much about things between my ex-partner and i that the breakup made no sense and was actually caused by mental illness instead of a genuine understanding of our situation. i am just really, really afraid. i do not know what to do.is this explicable with depression alone? do i probably have something else? are there ssris that improve memory, or some other effective treatment? please, any answers would be of help. i am really frightened. i am depressed. i have really, really bad memory loss. am i crazy in some other way, or can my depression alone explain this?",2

"muscle weakness from anxiety? hello all! this is a wordy post but i really need some input on this. amp i have a heaping helping of ocd and gad. since last summer i have been going through a huge amount of stress from changing medications and not yet having found the right combination, all while working full time with adhd. i also started taking blood pressure medication because that's just how my body responds to antidepressants i have bad genes, clearly. amp two months ago, i started having full body muscle weakness. i don't necessarily feel it all the time, although i am a lot more prone to soreness now. but any time i try to do anything physical climbing stairs, washing dishes, actual exercise my muscles start getting fatigued and that ""burning"" sensation that comes with a lot of activity. i feel like i have about a third of the stamina i usually do and my baseline stamina isn't great , and i'll feel like i've done a long workout after basically nothing. i have always had a tendency to muscle stiffness but never experienced anything like this. amp my doctor has run a bunch of tests and there's absolutely no medical reason she can find for this. this started a few weeks after i started a blood pressure medication that worked, but my blood pressure is not low and she cannot find any electrolyte imbalance anything else that might be caused by it. neither my pcp nor psychiatrist have ever heard of a side effect like this for any of the medications i'm on. amp so my question is, have any of you ever heard of or experienced muscle weakness like i'm describing as a side effect of stress anxiety? i definitely have had physical illnesses from anxiety before pain, dizziness, nausea but this is new. i wouldn't be surprised if this was from the stress of the past few months, but i really can't say. any input would be very appreciated!",0

"so i know suicidal feelings are probably the result of trauma and modern life, capitalism sucks, but most definitely a parent making you feel like you do not deserve your existence and it is definitely my case, but being aware of it does not solve anything. i feel unable to heal. i feel like i cannot move on. i feel like i am tired. i cannot go on. i am too young to be living on my own. i want my dad to tell me he loves me but i pushed him away. i want to play with his xbox. i want to hang out with him. i want him to help me pay a doctor and help me figure out what is going on inside my mind because my mom abused me so bad. i want to go running with him. but i cannot because i ruined our relationship and i cannot fix it, and i am afraid to fix it. i want my ex to hold me but i pushed him away too. i want to never have hurt important friends in my life, but it is too late. i want to become better at singing but i cannot bring myself to be disciplined enough to practice. i want to workout but i do not feel like it. i want to be good at my job but i am always fucking up when my boss is present and she thinks i am mediocre. i want to be okay but i do not feel ready to be okay. i am not used to the absence of caos. i feel like trying to get better is a trap. i feel like my mother's abuse started from the moment she decided to conceive me and killing myself would be actually rebelling against her because maybe the fact that i am still here, suffering, without justice for what she did to me, is exactly what she wants, but i cannot stop feeling so much pain in my soul. i am too tired. i cannot go on. i cannot do this. i want out. i cannot be fixed",6

"what s your relationship between bipolar and chronic pain? i read that bd and chronic pain are commonly paired together, but i haven t met doctors or therapists who have had experience with both at the same time. i was diagnosed with fibromyalgia even before my bd diagnosis. makes me wonder if it s really common of if that s just internet facts. usually, when i wake up with my entire body stiff in pain, and my energy levels sapped, i m having a down day. and the opposite is true when i m elevated. also, my days of no pain and not enough sleep crash into a downward spike, so it makes sense that i wear out because of that. anyway, curious to hear your experiences, what you do to mitigate the pain, etc.",1
"i have severe depression that has been diagnosed but my mom refuses to treat it and says i am faking, that its all in my head. my mother is a narcissist and is convinced the internet planted these ideas in my head even though i have previous childhood trauma and adhd. she is just convinced that i am fine but i am far from it. i have a pet allergy and have prescribed medication that makes me extremely drowsy and take benadryl as needed but have access to it regardless. its been months since i have started taking it daily, twice a day sometimes three times, its become a ritual. my mom just yells at me for being constantly asleep and lazy but she does not even know that i am abusing my medication like i do. i cannot even stand being awake anymore, i cannot stand being myself. its like i cannot stand waking up, i cannot stand living anymore, and when i am asleep its like my only escape. when i fall asleep its my only chance to not be me. nothing is fun. nothing is worth it. i just want to sleep. i cannot stand being awake anymore",2
i am a make and i am 16 and i just broke up with my gf. when i was little i was touched by a girl in my school and she kept doing it even after i said no. although i told my close friends what happened they told me i was a loser and that i should have liked it. sometimes when i go to sleep at night i can still hear there voices telling me i am a loser and my recent relationship did not help. during the relationship i felt like i was more of a therapist than i was her boyfriend and she dumped all of her problems and issues on to me and expected me to be able to make her feel better every time. this made me feel horrible about myself because anytime i did not make her feel better we would have an argument and then he would say she was wrong and apologize. we have had more than 60 arguments over our 6 month relationship. and anytime i would ask my friends if i should break up with her they would say no. but during my last two weeks of school my parents told me i could not call anyone or play games so my grades would stay up. the same friends that told me not to break up with her told her to break up with me for not talking to her. i broke up with her because she wants me to give her 6 hours a day and anytime i ask for time to myself she would see upset. i hate myself right now and i do not know why. i have cut myself multiple times and have to pretend like everything is ok when in reality i am 5 seconds away from breaking down. i do not want to seem emotional because i feel like my friends are just going to tell me i am overreacting and it is not as bad as i am making it. i am scared to tell my parents because i feel like they will see me differently. if anyone could give me some help i would love it or at least some advice on what to do i would love it. sorry for the long entry. recently have been thinking about killing myself a lot,2

so my roommate recently moved out and our apartment is pretty empty and ever since she moved out i ve had the worst anxiety attacks and have been kinda depending on my boyfriend and spending time with him to distract me but he works night and that s when my anxiety is the absolute worst. everything flutters through my head. like i think i m annoying him by asking him to spend so much time with me?? he s never expressed this. he s actually expressed the complete opposite which is nice but i feel like i m being too clingy and too annoying leading me to want to spend some alone time in my apartment but my apartment just makes me more sad because i m alone and i feel useless like no one care???,5
i realized he is not very nice or smart and totally unwilling to cooperate compromise. i wanted to leave but he had spent all my money promising to give it back haha and i had nowhere to go. i had the baby he went out to eat with his mother while i was in unmedicated labor . basically i made one stupid mistake after another and let him walk all over me and it doesn't stop there. i took care of the baby all by myself for 6 months.,5

"does this just sound like anxiety depression? hey! i know you guys arent doctors, and i am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists, but i was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight. i feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels. amp sometimes i just get these episode where everything gets ""scary."" i just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy. my life feels almost like a horror movie during these times. usually a small sound such as my fridge, pc, anything really will seem to grow louder and seem eerie spooky. my thoughts go down this loop of ""do i have some sort of serious chronic mental illness, will i feel this way forever, will it get worse?"" and of course i try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can, but the feelings are still there and very real. sometimes i get very weird and super brief thoughts of doing rash things flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example . it feels like there's an anchor in my stomach and sometimes, but not usually, ill get shaky and have heart palpitations. these episodes last for well over 15 minutes and i never feel normal afterwards so i get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks, because they way other people describe there's, i feel as though mine are a lot different. amp another thing to add, is over the summer i did acid for the first time, and i always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future. so i often fear that i did acid and fucked myself over because of it, but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort. amp if anyone could give me some insight, or share what their crippling anxiety feels like i would love to hear it. thanks guys -nn",0

"i lost my mom then 45 days later i lost my 12 yr old son. my mom was sickly. she would told me she was tired. in the hospital, she had rallied. we thought she would be coming home. then she did not make it. my son was extremely grief striken. i realized he was not ok. i sent him to therapy. 3 days later, he was gone. i found him. my only baby. i went to the store and when i got back, i found him. he is everything to me. and, life is not worth living without him. i have to see everyone else's children grow and reach milestones. but, not my child. i die inside more and more each day. 3 months after he left me. i could not take it. i failed and wound up in the psych ward for a month. that was in 2019. i am struggling to keep it together and continue to appear ""ok"". i know my biggest fear is that if i succeed i may never be reunited with him in heaven. but , it is almost worth it to not have to live without him. he is my baby. i also do not want anyone else to feel what i am feeling. but, most days, i just pray god will just be finished with me. i have been in a really bad place the last few days. i know i need help. but, i feel like i have no place to turn. i feel alone in pain and i am tired. safe haven",6

"for the longest time i have been very very depressed. my depression started when i was probably in elementary school. i was sent to the counselor's office because i looked sad or i was acting sad or i was not participating in class because i was so overwhelmed with my emotions. my father has always been completely distant, shows no emotion except for when he was hitting me. my mother was fucked up on drugs and alcohol and physically and emotionally abused me. her 2nd and 3rd husbands do not like me either.i developed a bunch of nervous and noticeable tics because i was so sad or sick. when i would get an each ache or strep, i would get punished month long groundings, beatings, name calling my mother tortured me when i came out to her as gay in 2003. she sent me to multiple doctors and told everybody in our closed-minded, racist, homophobic family that i was gay. she also kicked me out of the house at 17. i ended up leasing a cheap sro studio in chicago so i could have a roof over my head. i paid for that rent with my job at best buy. i still do not know how i did it, but i didfast forward to 2015. i went through a bad breakup and ended up doing cocaine almost every night on top of my raging alcoholism in order to cope and numb the feelings. 2016 i started doing heroin occasionally and now i do it almost every day -- its been like this since september 2020 despite all of this, i was still dating because i thought that finding a partner would fix everything.i met the person who i thought would be my partner for life in 2018. even though he ghosted me on my birthday, then ghosted me again at thanksgiving that same year i still kept coming back. i love him so much, but i do not understand why.at the beginning of the pandemic, he a new condo and i moved in with him. we slept in separate rooms many nights because we both snore so bad.i loved being with him all the time. but the feeling was not mutual.my partner knew about my demons with drugs and depression -- he also had a drug problem about 10 years ago. i admitted to him that i had been doing heroin almost every night in december 2020. i pleaded for him to not leave me over this and that i was going to rehab as soon as my fmla benefits were active so i could go to rehab. i wanted to be honest and open, and i was.on march 2nd of this year, i told my partner that i would be starting treatment on march 16. i was very proud of myself for doing this. he, however, flipped out on me and told me that i needed to move out. now i had to drop out of the rehab program so i could find a new apartment and pay for the move. this led me to spending most of my money on heroin.i expressed to my ex back in march that i was very suicidal. he told me i would never be able to live with myself if you did that to me.i still see him a few times a week. why, though?anyway all of this has led me to crippling suicidal thoughts for the last couple of months. the only reason i have not done it yet is because my apartment is a mess and i do not want to put the burden of cleaning up on anybody i know.but i guess it does not matter on my end. ill never see these people again, right?i am quite sure that i am going to be done with all of this by the end of july. i cannot take life anymore. humans are horrible.tl dr i am a 35 year old gay man who has been experiencing depression for the last 25 years or so. i am also an addict. the one person that i love broke up with me in march right before i was scheduled to go rehab. i have nothing now except sadness and anxiety. i cry myself to sleep every night. people are poison",6
"7 years later tales from an so hey all. a whiiiiiiile back i had a really rough week. and i wrote about it here. well, i just wanted to say life is fucking grand. yeah, chris has bipolar. yeah, his medications suck. but he's up again. he's doing again. this isn't a sudden thing either, this has been slow and gradual and we wouldn't want it any other way as if we had it faster that's... bad news. but... our relationship is better than it's ever been. i stuck through the worst of things and honestly the worst was only about 1-2 years. only. i know that's a long time but seriously, compared to eternity, it's nothing. during that 1-2 years time i basically had lost all hope, and was only driven by my promise and loyalty to my husband. promises that were hard to keep because he seemed like such a doppelganger. we kept adjusting medications. we lowered stress in our lives. i took over on all the hard stuff and i give chris whatever latitude i can. i've lost my judgementality. chis still judges himself very strongly and i am trying to help him be less critical. he's come a long way but he wants to help more and i think this is a good sign. he just needs to be more patient with himself. about 4 years ago he had another psychotic break. this was while he was medicated. but the problem was we were moving. the stress of this put him over it's something that happens. but the second time was much milder, much easier. firstly, everything was set up so we had a p-doc the best, thank you madeline, god, thank you so god damned much and he had medication, and he was able to recognize the discrepancies. the first time through he had no idea something had gone wrong in his head. but this time he did and it made a huge difference. here's where i wrote about it at one point, sorry the picture is missing my hosting screwed up i'll have to fix that later. anyway, that was much milder and cleared up in a few months. so, all sounds pretty bad-ish, not grand like i claim, but seriously, let's step back and look at things, specifically this statement gt during that 1-2 years time i basically had lost all hope i. had. lost. all. hope. i had lost the love of my life. he was gone. i was resigned to caring for his shell for the rest of my days. i even... god help me... i even wished for his death. or my own. and now i have him back. there are no words i can write to explain the magnitude of this. none. all the worldly troubles i've ever had have melted in the face of this tragedy. all of them. anyway, hope this was worth a little read. chris will be waking up soon and i am gonna cuddle him back into bed the moment he does! lt 3 ---- edit tips for bipolar sos during the bad times take it a day at a time there's only so much you can do to help. get them their pills on time. force a smile, laugh even if you don't think you need to. be around when you can. you also have to help yourself. focus on work, focus on friends, focus on you. stop worrying every second about your so, the worries don't help either of you. during the good times enjoy the shit out of them",1

"acceptance...for now. i've been on disability for a good while now. anyone on disability can probably relate to the strong desire to be away from it. the social security office generally treats you like a criminal, you never know who agrees with the negative stigma and sees you as some sort of lazy leach on society, and some days, you fight with the notion yourself. many people tie worth to one's ability to work and contribute, and it's easy to fall into that realm of thought where you feel worthless and ashamed. anyway, to my story. around june last year, i was put on a game-changing medication. my anxiety disappeared seemingly overnight, and i felt more confident and comfortable than i have for most of my life. gears started turning in my head. i could go out among the people! maybe i could find some companionship and stop feeling so lonely. maybe i could earn my keep and feel some pride for a change. this lead to me starting a second part-time job with the intention of ramping up my hours carefully and slowly, the goal being to eventually be making enough to support myself without the ssdi check, medicare, etc. i was certain i was on track to being an honest, ""normal"" person. i took on more and more responsibilities. things were looking good for about 6 months. then the medication turned on me, as it seems they all eventually do. every day, things get worse. while it still keeps the majority of my anxiety at bay, i now have a persistent depression. i've lost interest in many things, including wanting to do a good job at work. i let things slip, do the bare minimum, and count each second until i am able to go home. increasing hours at a job that i am having less and less of a tolerance for seems like a good way to speed up an inevitable crash and burn. if something doesn't change soon, i will likely have a breakdown and or wind up in the hospital. and for what? before i started the new med and took the second part-time job, i was doing okay for myself. my first part time job was enough to keep me connected to the outside world, even though the pay might have been considered token at best. i kept myself busy with personal projects. at times i felt lonely, but i had friends. i had trouble with anxiety and depression, but i had time and space to cope. in my current situation, i feel like i'm on a speeding train. there are no time-outs when i am feeling terrible. what time i have for my own interests is tainted by dread of the next workday and this consistent, low current of depression. the second part-time job has made the first one, the one i found rewarding and enjoyable, feel like an inescapable chore. all i want to do now is go home and hide. all this effort put in to build a ""respectable life"" and dig myself out from under disability, and i feel so much more frightened, fragile, and trapped than before. no medication has been effective for me for such a long duration. i was certain it was the one, so i ended up biting off more than i could chew. now, i'm dependent on a drug that makes me miserable and puts me in a precarious emotional state every day. i stress out and hide from my responsibilities. every day i feel inadequate and not up to snuff. and why? because i felt guilty for being on disability? because i was certain that life free off it would be better? that i couldn't have companionship, self-worth, or be among the living if i wasn't earning my keep in traditional terms? after much thought, i have made a conscious choice to ""regress."" clearly, working full time is not an attainable goal for me right now. i'm cutting my current average of 15 hours per week at my second job to around 7. between it and my first job, i'm likely looking at around 10 a week, which i think will be manageable. also, i'm getting off the ""wonder drug"" that keeps my anxiety at bay at the cost of my sanity and happiness. i will regroup, stabilize, and find some damned peace. being off disability wasn't in the cards this time, and that's okay. there's a reason i was put on it in the first place. maybe i will find an opportunity to be financially independent in the future, maybe not. but i will stop with the self-shaming. i can still have a worthwhile life, whatever the circumstances. tl dr - i found a wonder drug, thought it would finally get me off disability. it didn't, and that's okay. life goes on. edit added tl dr and fixed some grammar.",1

"first real date we walked in the park for like an entire day, then the next day watched a movie. we kissed, which was my first time doing that, cool. but it turned out she wasn't as into me as i was her. so its over, all for the best. i'm feeling so positive about it. it was painful for the first couple days after no lie, but now i feel great. i was so worried that i wouldn't be able to make a move sexually, but i did it. it was awkward as hell obviously, but i did it. i was bold as fuck. and it was really no big deal. i saw her again the other day and it was totally cool, no hard feelings. i finally feel like a real living human being. it's like i've been set free in a major way. only a year after i asked out the first person haha. feels like a lifetime ago. i never thought i'd actually get here, and i'm so grateful that i did. and i have so much time ahead of me. i'm only 24. i used to look at the future and see only dread and misery, but now i see hope and promise. thank you thank you",4
"2 years of relentless hiv anxiety - please read and keep calm for the last couple of years, i have been utterly petrified of hiv. i'd say it has crossed my mind at least once an hour for the last 2 years and 4 months. statistically, the chances of me having it were alwaysridiculously small, and none of the science would support the hypothesis that i had contracted hiv. but some brains work in funny ways. and mine is an example of a brain that immediately believes the worst possible outcome. and i'm sure there are many many many more out there who have wrapped themselves in a similar web of self-loathing and utter panic. the advent of dr google is good, but it can also do some terrible things for our mental health. the solution the whole time was simple test. test and set yourself free. it's hugely important on so many levels to know your hiv status. for your own health, for your sexual partner's health. for the sake of the nhs. i am so glad i got tested. i can literally feel a part of my brain resuming activity. it feels strange not carrying around the fear i had been carrying before it has literally given me a headache as my brain tries to decide how to reallocate this space. i had all the symptoms. absolutely text book seroconversion illness. fever, sore throat, swollen glands, night sweats, stomach discomfort, everything. doctor's presumed it was glandular fever, but tests never confirmed the presence of the ebv which it should for glandular fever . classic ars. of course, after a couple of weeks i was back on my feet again, and the doctor was quite content.then about a year after this, i came out in a weird rash that wouldn't go away for like 2 weeks. seemed like some sort of bacterial infection to me . and it always got worse in the sun. obviously my immune system was compromised. from the moment of my ""glandular fever"" my brain had convinced myself i was carrying hiv. but i wasn't brave enough to test. i was being cowardly. however, over the last few months i've been having some stomach issues, which are pretty non-specific, and the internet didn't really help me link it to hiv. the doctor did suggest a cbc test for me though, i think just to get an idea if anything was going on, blood-wise obviously lol . i was told by the nurse who carried out the blood test that it was very much a case of ""no news is good news"". of course, having had the blood test on monday, first thing on tuesday i got a call from the doctor. my white blood cell count was low, and she wanted me to come in so she could feel my lymph nodes. ahhhhh! my brain went in to overdrive. i couldn't cope. this was it. my worst fears realised. why me? why me?!! that's exactly what hiv does - it attacks white blood cells. nooooo! i went in for the doctor's appointment, and she said all my lymph nodes were normally and no cause for concern. she did then say, ""i would like to test you for hiv"". my world was crumbling inwards. i couldn't believe that this was happening to me, a very conservative, early twentys, heterosexual male. i looked at the statistics to such a deep level, that i knew that in my country of residence, there was only 32 males aged 15-24 who were hiv positive. that's essentially like 0 of the population. i was about to become a medical phenomenon. the doctor eventually decided just to take the cbc again in 6 weeks time, and that we wouldn't test for hiv just yet as i kind of freaked out when she suggested the hiv test . but the time was now - i needed to know. i would have no quality of life with this intense level of anxiety coursing through every fibre of my being, every second of the day. i had a second job interview for a pretty plush job that day, and i totally flunked it due to the unbearable mental tension i felt. i did manage to summon the courage to order a hiv home test kit, which i had delivered to my family home, where i would have the test in the presence of my family so that i could receive immediate support from those closest to me when the test returned a positive result and in my head, it was very much of when not if . i spoke to them on the day the doctor said about my low wbc, and they were all wonderfully supportive did have to speak to my mum about my sex-life though - not ideal . so i went home yesterday, and i had the test. and, of course, it was a big fat negative. which it always has been. it was a crucifying 15 minutes waiting for the test to work, but during those 15 minutes, on a deep level i felt a sense of peace. the band aid had been ripped off, and life was going to move on. hiv is the worst for health anxiety, as almost everything can be linked back to it. the anxiety can make your brain question everything - i was even questioning my ability to swallow at one point. but the chances are, going off the plethora of statistics out there, you don't have it, whoever you are who is out there searching for every piece of hiv research ever which has been me for the last two years . but still, if the anxiety is as stressful and overbearing as what i was experiencing, you need to get tested. now. somehow. make it happen. i took the time to write this in the hope that someone who is currently going through a similar thing to what i went through, can find solace in it. you will be alright regardless. you are a good person. but you need to put your mind to rest. you need to have the test. 'thinking fast and slow' by daniel kahneman teaches a brilliant lesson in terms of this. our brains are desperate to come up with a story that will justify our irrational way of thinking catastrophising. but numbers matter. statistics speak volumes. you are not special. you are overwhelmingly likely to be normal. you aren't the 1 in 100,000 shot. you are the 99,999 out of 100,000 shot. our brains struggle to compute the true values of these numbers, but we must try. peace!",0

"my generic eye pain is totally an eye-eating parasite, right? woke up this morning around 4am to my eye burning like hell, my eye was pouring tears and super sensitive to light, my vision was blurred, and my eyelids felt like they were coated in glass. i got pissed, thinking i maybe had pink eye. waited until 8am to go in to the doctor. by the time i did this, all that was left was a vague shred of soreness and light sensitivity- no more redness or crying. doctor couldn't figure out what was wrong. cue my anxiety. she put me on antibiotic eye drops, and told me to go to an ophthalmologist if it gets worse. fast forward to this evening. the burning is back. not as bad as before, but it's dull and present. and now, i'm freaking out. hyperventilating, sobbing, posting to reddit. sounds dumb, i know. but i'm fucking terrified. my vision is everything to me and eye problems freak me out more than anything in the entire world. i keep thinking back to some stupid show i saw where someone contracted acanthamoeba and i'm running through the symptoms non-stop. this guy got it by wearing contacts in the shower? shit! i did that three times last week! his eye felt like a foreign object was in it! oh fuck! me too! i know that the symptoms for just about every eye problem include ""red, itchy, burning"" but i'm so fixated on this worst case scenario i'm making myself sick. i'll take a thousand nightmares of pregnancy scares and infections that'll kill me over this one. it honestly feels like my life is ending, ha. anyway, i'm not claiming that i have this-- but i've mentally convinced myself that i do. anyone able to talk some sense into me?",0

"how to be there for a depressed friend? hey everyone, a friend of mine struggels a lot since a few years. she is 59yo and about 4 years ago her mom got sick and she cared for her til the mom died. they lived in the same house. her adult daughter is on a different continent and cares pretty much for herself only -wich is ok, they have a good realationship, i just try to draw the whole picture. she lost a close friend to cancer in december, they have spent nearly every day together. since 2 years she isnt able to work because of her depression. 2 months ago she tried to explain to her doctor that she wants to work again, not fulltime, just to get back some routine in her days. doc declined. now shes at home most of her time. alone. her loved cat died earlier this year. she says the whole house just feel dead to her and she is so lonley there. but at the same time she doesnt want to be around others. i know that every time i visit her she struggles and is always close to cancel, but knows that she feels a little better afterwards. she is calling for help -indirectly. i get the calls. she wants back some structure in her days. she wants to help someone by reading books for kids or a women in a wheelchair who is helpless. but she cant bring herself to do it. i dont want to push her to much. but i also have to strong urge to help her somehow. more than visit her once a week and listen to her. but i dont know how. i cant imagine the situation she is going throuht. i cant relate to that feeling but i want her to get better and be that brave, wise, strong and creative person she was before. she wants help but i dont know how. she cant bring herself and i dont wanna be to pushy. i thouhgt maybe you guys can give me some advice! ps she is in therapy",2

"i have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. i have extreme anxiety which i think ultimately makes me depressed. i put off dealing with the issues for years, because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. in my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. i had a lot of bad circumstances, but after i graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. a few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. i met this cute, funny, guy through mutual friends - and he asked me out on a date. there was an instant attraction. we talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. it was the happiest id ever been in my life. i had a job, i moved out of my parents house, i had friends, and i had a loving boyfriend. my life was finally coming together how i wanted it. i thought, maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. i was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.then - just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary, my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. i was completely blindsided. he told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be, and was not falling in love with me. he cut me off and never reached out, even on my birthday. my life fell apart. all of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.i realized that i am not valued or competent at my job, all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with. and honestly? i miss living with my parents and can barely afford to make it by. i hate my life. everyday i go to sleep and hope that i just do not wake up. i want to disappear. i frequently fantasize about suicide but i know i am not brave enough to do it. i have put my poor parents through enough by creating such a mess of my life. nothing can make it better, just have to keep dealing with the pain of life. i think this is rock bottom",2

"i see an overarching theme here where people are deciding whether or not they want to stay or go. they often decide they want to go, but yet cannot bring themselves to do it. i also observe that many here are young, so i wanted to add another perspective. everyone is situation is different, and i am not here to recommend anything, but i can tell you, when it comes to living with depression, it does not get better with time. depression is a very selfish and self-centered disorder. we obsess over ourselves, how we have affected others, and how we feel. we also obsess over how the people we leave behind would feel with us being gone. we consider those who we have hurt in life, but we fail to consider this the countless others we are going to hurt. when i think of all of the pain i could have spared people, it becomes overwhelming. the marriages i ruined, the relationships, the children i brought into the world. you think its painful to disappoint your parents? failing your children is a pain 100 times worse. exposing those who love you--whom you are supposed to protect--to the addiction, abuse, the emotional absence, and all of the other awful things that come along with depression is horrible. then, you find yourself in a place where you cannot leave, because you are a provider and you cannot devastate your children. its like being in one of those movies where going to hell is being damned to live the same day over and over. and all you have to look forward to is growing old, the loss of family members, the decline of your health, financial struggles, and career failures. yeah, things could get better. but if you are wired as badly as we are, this is highly unlikely. not only will things get worse for you, but you will ruin the lives of people you have yet to meet, some of whom have not yet been born. consider all of this as you decide whether you want to stay or go. maybe it will get better--probably it will not",2

"9 months ago, i very suddenly got depressive symptoms. id been struggling with anxiety before that and was in therapy for that reason. depression hit me like a brick in the face and i started to share thoughts of suicide to my friends and therapist. i was involuntarily hospitalized after i cut myself in public. from there it stayed bad.while i could avoid the psych ward within the last 9 months except for that one time, i have scars all over my body, especially my leg, from cutting myself. they are itchy, horrible and so fucking ugly.i do not think i have spent a week without an episode in the last 9 months, no week without thoughts about killing myself. i have friends, a therapist, ill be put on medication. there is a boy and if i can trust him, he likes me just as much as i like him and we may have a future. things are objectively getting better compared to when all of this started, i was lonely and being emotionally abused by a friend. but i have lost trust in all of this. in my head, i cannot get better. i cannot believe i am loved even though i kind of know i am, logically.i constantly still think of killing myself and today is one of those days. the thoughts do not stop even though life is getting better",6

"4 years ago i wasnt showering for months at a time, depressed, anxious and paranoid. at the time i was sober going on 18, 19 years. i was, and am on disability since 09' for schizoaffective bipolar type disorder. for the longest time, especially since sobriety, i've been overwhelmed with thinking. space, time, behavior, tornadoes...whatever. but, since my life was an unmanaged train wreck i had no confidence in myself as having any quality. it seems that feeling good about yourself comes from a well managed life. my last job was as a janitor on the army base near by roughly 5 years ago. i couldnt handle the pressure. i was so dependant on others for everything i was asking if i was sweeping properly. very bad mindset. a lady mentioned crying and it made me feel like crying. i didnt understand how that could be. it seemed like witchcraft, so to speak. that was my last day at my last job. it was my 4th attempt to go back to work since my disability badge acquisition! i've been in therapy for 16 or 17 years ago i got into therapy from a mental health episode. during that visit at the crisis stabilisation unit in virginia fredricksburg i met a man that changed my life. he went by the name bose uncle. he taught me a breathing exercise. 3 in 6 out. you breath in deep for 3 seconds roughly then out for 6 seconds. also roughly. dont try to be specific like me and do it exactly 3 and 6. on down the road, life and me under pressure and practicing my breathing because sufferage bleep blop bloop, pandemic. overwhelming, unadulteraded pain in the brain from an anxiety i'd never expierenced before i saw a vision. it seemed to be the exact same thing that happened to bill wilson from aa. a wind blew through me. his words. my words on it are, i was no longer a bound up point in time and space holding on to the memories from the stimulation from the moment. i was free from the tension that came about from the fucking utter bullshit that exists. i let it go. the moment. i stopped holding and figuring. amp it was like my being afraid got wore out. i remember specifiaclly saying to myself at the height of my pain in a ridgid bodily posture laying in my recline, ""bullshit."" i calle dbullshit on my old beliefs. that old fire and brimstone god. intstead i chose ""my concept"" of life as my god. my ideas are good to. changed life. about six months later i nearly died from pancreatitis. when i got home from 6 days in the hospital i shared it on facebook. i received a good number of get well soon messages as expected. i did not get what i thought i would. people coming to visit, bringing me food...all that. i nearly fucking died. i know hundreds of people. what does that mean? my perception is fucked up, my beghhvior is fucked up, i need to change. i did not think that way at first. at first i thought, ""i fucking hate everyone."" for a while. then 6 months later, i got diagnosed with autism. april 24th 2021. 6 months later after learning to relax, i rested on my heels for the first time in my life. this began the second chapter of my life. the taking my time portion. the i am the most impotant person in my life to me. you all come second. for ever. i no longer run to the kitchen, the bathroom, through the grocery store, drive fast, or move my limbs fast. i have even taken control of my eyes speed of movement. did you know that your body can control your mind. if you dont control your body your body will be controlled by your environment throught the mind. you receive stimulus simply due to being a sensing being. this moves you. if you are not aware of it. make yourself aware of this and take control of your body, the way you look, smell, move behavior speed amplitude of voice ...total bodily control and you can eliminate a great deal of your own suffering. i havew come off my depression meds and greatfully have finally been more aptly medicated with litium. now i dont have to force myself into slow mo behavior but i do stay aware i think from a bit of fear. you can control your thinking! you can control your thinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! amp i wish i could impress upon whomever needs it that the pause in conversation is ok. moving the body oddly slow is not odd. not speaking is an answer. and, you dont owe a motherfucker a goddamn thing if it stresses you out. peace in east!",0

"long story short, i am working with a psychologist to finally get to the root of 25ish years of moderate depression. it is hard to explain everything through the trauma i remember having suffered, mostly body dysmorphia and being a social outcast. there are some other things that potentially point towards sexual abuse at a young age. i cannot remember a thing and there are no risk factors for abuse in my very loving family, though there was some risk exposure to someone outside my family. since working with my great psych i have started to feel occasional feelings after decades of emotional repression i am also starting to be a lot more aware of dreams that often involve me violently defending myself, though contain no sexual content. the dreams lately have been really rough, it is like even when i sleep i am not resting. it is just very disorienting not knowing if anything happened or if it did what it was. i am also worried i am reaching for an explanation of my depression that goes beyond what i already know a feeling like what i was subjected to does not justify the level of depression i have suffered . it would be helpful to know what someone is experience was like uncovering fully repressed trauma of any kind. the good news is that i never tried to kill myself even after years of strong ideation though came close to accidental death a few times doing high risk sports and jobs . i have managed to keep my health and avoid the very alluring pull of drinking and drugs. i have a wonderful partner, two amazing dogs, a great family, and good career, and some wonderful friends. i can even afford some treatment. i know lots of folks here have very difficult life circumstances that exacerbate their depression and i really feel for them. it is quite disorienting when you basically have everything going your way and still feel like shit though. thanks! what was your experience uncovering and processing repressed trauma?",2
"it can be really tough to open up about mental health struggles, or something in our lives that may because or contribute to depression. i have the faith the risk to share is in fact worth it though.something great that happened to me recently, my friend helped me stay in a motel for a couple days, to have space from a stressful circumstance. it helped me realize i am not stuck in an endless loop of the same old, and there are things i can do which might be scary and uncertain but will also change my trajectoryi'd love to hear your encouraging stories too! what was something great that happened as a result of sharing your true experiences with someone?",2

alcohol and mental illness stole my life from me. i should have graduated university a couple months ago. instead i am on day 8 of not calling or going to work at all because i woke up too hungover and withdrawing last monday to even put in the effort to call in. it would have been fine too they would have probably seen it as a positive that i called at all. my bosses are incredibly understanding and know i am struggling. i have pulled this shit like 3 times in the last 4 months. i should have been fired a dozen times. i just keep disappointing everyone. i am the black sheep of my family and i just want it to fucking end i really need someone to talk to. i have not wished for death this much in a long time,6
"going to get five replies maybe none do not care even as i am typing this out what is the point. i find people boring. i do not like drinking. i do not like hanging out because the main activity in that is talking and what is there to talk about? i cannot connect with people. there is something missing. something they have that i do not or maybe something i have that they do not? its like a flat line on those heart monitors they use in the hospital when i talk to people. maybe a few brief moments of an upward jolt, but mostly a flat line, nothing there. sometimes id rather not be here. i exist though. this is my template. so if i am human that means i must be natural, not abnormal, because i have a brain, legs, and hands like everyone else. no medication. no need. can function normally and do not have a chronic condition. hopefully i disappear and this all ends no more typing this is getting boring now you can judge me negatively because i spoke out i know you want me gone because i am not like you title",2

"first, some background, i am 38 m and have been living with mom for the past six years. i moved back in with her because i was in a bad financial and emotional state. lost my job was basically broke. after going through another couple jobs, i finally found stability in a job that i have had for the past few years. now, i am thinking about moving out as it is time do that and my mom's going to retire soon.still there is some uncertainty about what i want to do next. i am not in not sure how much i want to stay with the career i have been able to save up a fair amount of money because of my situation so i have some options i guess. i know that i have to make my own way in this world in spite of the issues i have but i am not sure what to do next.i do not really have much to keep me where i am now which is pretty much where i have lived all my life. i do not have any real friends, except for some that i message every once in a blue moon on fb. i have lived on my own before so i know i can do it but i wonder if getting a fresh start in a place far from where i am now is a good idea.not sure if i should go somewhere where i am close to family or if i should not let that be something that is really important part of where i decide to go next. i know my depression is not as bad as some people's but it is something i still deal with on daily basis and the loneliness of not having friends is probably the worst part of it. i am hoping that getting away from this place that has so much personal negative history to it will help but i am not sure. have any you been in a similar situation? did moving help? did you try to stay close to your family? thanks in advance. thinking about moving and getting a fresh start",2

to me it seems like something everyone struggles with sometimes. i know it is a serious thing but i just do not understand why it is not normal. is it possible to not think about suicide sometimes? i think about it often last year i thought about it every day. i had a pill bottle in my closet i had a plan but i knew i would never do it because it is too scary i am afraid it will hurt and that i will fail the attempt. no one ever knew because it feels stupid to tell someone i have the thoughts but i am not actually going to do it i just think about it. if a few years ago someone told me they were suicidal i would have been shocked and kind of scared but if someone tells me now it is just a normal thing to me. it see it as something normal that happens to everyone. like having a bad day everyone has bad days sometimes. but i have those thoughts too so i should understand that it is a very serious thing but i do not are suicidal thoughts normal,6

"i got heavily exposed to some really toxic mold about five years ago while working as a scuba instructor. there was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and i was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat once i had figured out what was going on it was too late i had been severely poisoned i have been trying to get my mental health back ever since a couple of years ago i developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus, with my hearing test coming back as normal. every time i talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue i have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but i need back up on this and there just is none. i have tried bringing what i have done and the limited success that i have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again the research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue to date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. and insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.i was recently able to push for a head mri and it showed something interesting in that it showed flagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. this was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the mri technician saw on the mri was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. i do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. it is looking like i may have had do have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. i asked my health insurer for a ct scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem, both were immediately denied. i am currently fighting them on that. what is the point on giving someone an mri if you plan on just ignoring the results?... if a ct scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation, my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. they are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.i have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. my health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that i am currently facing. i have been so destroyed by this situation that i am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year i just switched over to state medi-cal insurance. since i am now on state insurance my copays are zero and i am pretty sure that i can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.these days i am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. the current rules state that i am supposed to go to emergency if i am passively suicidal. i do not because i think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but i think that i might start going. since, if i start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless i pose an immediate threat to myself or others. this will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me at what point will the state stand up and take notice? fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted, a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand? there has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. i doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. then i can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there. the negative publicity for health insurer may be very significant. let me know what you think? i am thinking about weaponizing the current laws against my health insurer to get adequate testing and treatment let me know what you think?",6

"really bad health anxiety at night some background... i was diagnosed with ocd in the third grade, but was suspected of having it long before that. i have bad intrusive thoughts. i've been in and out of therapy for many years. within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again, like it was when i was a child. in late 2016, when i was 19, i went through a phase where i thought i was dying every. single. night. i ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. i lost over 60 pounds in like 2-3 months. i got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. it helped a lot and continues to help. now, like a year and a half later, it's not as bad as it was in that period, but the symptoms linger still. i haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. i'll go to the doctor if i catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup. now....this is because i'm like, terrified that i'll find out that i have a terminal illness. cancer, of any type, kidney failure, some kind of disease... whatever, it doesn't matter. whenever i think about it i freak out and get nauseous and scared. when i'm laying in bed at night i will feel my boobs for lumps, and always convince myself something is there when it isn't, in different parts of my boobs. i've gotten to a point where i dont even like touching them. i know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap, but it scares me so bad i'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. i'm not currently in therapy but i know i need to be. it's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep, but it's seeping over into my daily life. if my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think i have it. it's gotten so bad that i actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. i just need to know that i'm not alone. i would also appreciate any advices or exercises that help...",0

"i tried this and it worked now i don't think it would've worked right when the anxiety started today but by the end of the day i was so sick of the panic, nausea, warm rushes, and racing thoughts while trying to act normal in front of my kids. i just said screw it, i'm going to stop fighting it and reasoning with myself why i'm fine and shouldn't be anxious and let it wash over me. it actually worked! i'm so much calmer now i might actually sleep tonight which never happens on bad days. i hope this can help others. i found this article which explains better than me.",0

my old life and everything and almost everyone i loved is gone. taken away. i do not know if i should hope for better or just die. the only things holding me back are hurting my mom and the thought of dying like this things cannot worsen if i am dead but they also cannot improve. should i even try?,6
"no matter how much i try, i can never see on why someone would willingly talk to me with their time and actually treat me like a human. i have such a negative mindset onto myself that i cannot fathom why people would talk to the likes of me.do they talk to me out of pity? want something from me in the future as 'compensation'? do they really not have anyone else better to talk to? other than these 3 questions that i always get into my head, i cannot help but wonder why else they would talk to me without hating me as a person.i cannot help but wonder if i just tried a little harder, maybe i would not be suicidal either and probably would not have to think of these negative thoughts over and over again. why do i feel like everyone secretly hates me?",6

"you aren t your thoughts. you aren t your thoughts. you just experience them. just like how we have mental illness, but we aren t the illness. it s a disease just like cancer. you don t see cancer patients saying i am cancer . they say they have cancer. i think saying i m bipolar makes it seem like i m saying that it s my identity. i remind myself all the time that bipolar is not an identity, its just a journey that i m on. a journey that is different than anyone else s.",1

time in my life who would ve know that be the last time i ll ever be happy i ve only been happy once this illness is for life making peace that it might never get better thinking of bigger idea

is clear and i m brave fierce today we begin the process which probably started before i even knew it did subconsciously i never had him or wanted him in the first place they re right it triggered me badly i wanted to die now i want to live at least till i get to go home non of this matter at the end of the day i have to admit i don t care about the superficial stuff i care about the ugliness amp

analysed why i did all those thing during elementary school that my mom had to literally befriend my teacher to make sure i m took care of i wa that troubled 9 i think of all these intruder that entered my body without my wish kelly moore s dad a white kindergarten teacher in a majority chinese school felix another white men that raped me unconsciously in the club naz in which i still not entirely sure how i got lured into i look back at my self i sometimes wondered what went wrong how i wa made the best and then the worst why did i always had a bad time why i don t remember anything why and why and why did all this happened to me i think i just had an over amount of change that now i need a giant break but i don t know how to relax i love you but who i need to love someone why do i do that when i don t know who you are i m so stressed out i can only move on being rough wa all i know just people forcing themselves onto me all the time maybe why i thought zaineb wa so special and i m not ready to have that again even thought iain count a my first love i think zaineb wa when i completely trusted someone i just feel wrong and not accepted i guess i had another thought all those time they ve touched me just touching me everyone not just at the club it be when i wa getting take out shopping at the super market i never said anything why didn t i every time i look in the mirror i see myself disappearing into a bubble i wish i wa brand new i wish i wa soft and clean fresh off the boat too i wish i still believed in the world and white men you guy are losing me bit by bit day by day faded into the background i guess for now i know there s more to life than romance and belonging there s knowledge and creation story line and peacefulness in nature i realised that s when i m most allowed to stay is when i realised i m not rejected by the other side i m not rejected by hell a place that ll understand me may devil protect me and be by my side got ta stop having death fantasy must be a reason why i m fortunate and not is it karma or wealth abused or wa i too spoiled to think i deserve happiness is it karma or illness it must be karma right i know everything about you i usually prepare my research before i meet you a guy anyone i go through your family photo your ex the girl you slept with before me and potentially after me too i spot for lie matching the story you told me with evidence the fun part is researching the girl you are fucking i can feel my heart beat it like an electrical rush of anxiety it s quite an easy and intimate process a i realised

i need clue i need to find out if i m the other woman why do you want to know thing you shouldn t know ugliest ugliest truth still better than lie in my opinion and when i learned the fact that i am nothing in your story this is where i imagine love story that involves the girl you actually like is this process psychopathic i think it s a poetic way of practicing being a wife haven t wrote shit

"i know this might be a feeling that many can relate to. i have had depression more or less half of my life, due to many different factors and things that have happened throughout my life.i used to drink alcohol quite frequently and even smoke a lot of weed. however i have quit those things completely a couple months ago, and that has been another journey in itself.i knew that indulging with different substances that make me high drunk, i pushed the feelings of anxiety and depression aside, not making them disappear but just forgetting about them for the moment. until they came back. for the last couple of months now i have been completely facing my shit, unable or should i say unwilling to ""escape"" by any means. i constantly have the feeling that i want to cry all the time. not just a little, but i have the feeling that i want to let the floods out for real, got so much tension inside and i know i have the potential and that it would feel much better afterwards. but at the same time i just feel so empty and cannot cry no matter how hard i try. it feels like those emotions somehow are trapped deep inside of me, and i would need a terrible reason to be able to ""let go"" of the pressure. instead of just letting it go and getting rid of it, it just keeps on staying where it is, and it is really frustrating... want to cry but cannot",2

"honestly at this point life feels like a burden. i do not see a reason to live anymore. i am ugly and short. yeah that is my problem. and nothing in the world frustrates me and advices like groom yourself, go to gym, skincare, be funny, be confident, be yourself, change yourself. you think i have not done any of those yet? plus browsing subreddits like amiugly or amihot have depressed me even more because the supposedly ""ugly"" people there are so beautiful. i cannot cope and quite frankly i do not want to live a life where i am underprivileged.today was my birthday too and i spent it all alone. every time i see beautiful and nice looking people, i envy them to no extent. i cannot go out. i literally broke down while walking in front of people, when i saw people laughing and holding hands.people often say enjoy your life, eat good food. i cannot man i am sorry i have tried it and it are not working. like anytime i see someone happy i get jealous. plus people do not understand what it means to be truly ugly. please give me a fucking reason to live.to be honest i do not even want to be in a relationship now, i do not want hugs, emotional support or intercourse. i just do not want to live.if you will put wings on me and throw me from a mountain, i would become a stealth aircraft. i am tired of my life.",6

"it is not like her - even when she was that age - to succumb to pressure like that. i'm trying really hard not to victim blame and immediately feel guilt when i think that way but, again, knowing my wife how i know her - as someone that's not afraid to call bs- it just makes it hard to conceive how she went along with it for so long, knowing that it made her uncomfortable, knowing that it was escalating, and then it was actual happening and her not saying no. i just can't believe these things happened on repeated occasions. i can absolutely see him pressuring her once, her not knowing how to respond when it happened, and then her saying ""this is bs, i'm out"" afterwards. but that she stuck around and let it happen multiple times just seems odd to me.",5

"i truly think these posts remove the purpose of this being a support sub, and there seems to be a flood of them. i know these people are hurting, but the way these posts are written makes them challenging to start discourse. i think people that posts here should be showing us that they clearly have hope to become better, even if that hope is minimal. again, there are soo many of these posts, and you can tell that others have a hard time figuring out how to approach these types of posts in a helpful manner. mods, can we ban remove ""will this kill me"" and ""what is the easiest way out"" posts?",6

"just when i think i've made it, i get pulled back in. i've had so many tests, painful and otherwise, over the past several weeks. after finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, i brought up with my doctor the one thing i didn't think about until recently. i could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery. what started to scare me, is that i realized i could feel that lymph node for something like 3 months . my doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning i got a really somber call from a nurse at the dr.'s office saying i needed to see an ent right away i not only have the one, but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in that area. my understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and they're enlarged at least one is on the order of 2cm , but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, i have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign. i've been freaking out all day and i've been trying to avoid the internet, but the soonest i can get in to see an ent is next tuesday, so i get to spend the next 4 days agonizing about this. i'm 38 years old, and i've been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months mostly heart related that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...",0

"hi, every since covid hit i have been struggling with being sad all the time and depressed. i was 13 when it started and have not been the same since. the problem is usually the reason i am sad is because i am super insecure of my weight how i look. i also never go out with people i used to because i break down because i hate how i look. everytime this happens or i am depressed for a few days i eat way to much, its basically a viscous cycle that happens all the time pretty much, some days are better then others but always bad. i was wondering if anyone have any suggestions on how to stop eating a lot or how to loose weight, or even have to love myself what ever works. if anyone else has struggled with this and has found a way to cope that would be great to know some tips. over eating",2

"do you guys ever wonder why you couldn t have just had a normal life like everyone else? my life was normal until my father died at 7 and my mom left at 9. i experienced childhood trauma, physical abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, and neglect by the people that raised me. not only that, i come from a strict religious immigrant family so along with all those issues, i was never allowed to leave the house much. my family also never went out and did anything and they also never showed me any love or affection. this was my life growing up until i finally moved out at 22. i ve since been doing better for myself as i ve graduated college and have a career now. but the damage was so severe that i don t think i ll ever fully recover. my upbringing made me lonely that i never had many friends. verbal abuse made me mute and unable to talk back so i can t talk with cluttering. i do not have much confidence or self esteem. i still do this day don t have many friends or much of a social life. i also have a hard time dating and at 28 still have not hooked up with a girl outside is kissing and making out. i look at my life and the look at everyone else. they all had loving caring parents, siblings to play with, and grew up with all the love and compassion in the world. they have many friends, they have boyfriends, they have girlfriends, they don t have speech issues, etc. they just seem to be able to live life normally unlike me. i did nothing wrong to deserve the things that happened to me as a kid as all of it out of out my control. but sometimes i ask myself, why me? just why? i was given only one life on this planet, why did my life go like this? why does everyone else get love and compassion while i got nothing but misery?",4

"hello, new here hello everyone, lurker for a small while now. i'm 24m. i'm in the process of getting diagnosed, cause my life is shit and i continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. everything points to avpd according to the psychiatric place i'm being diagnosed in, so i figured i'd check out the sub some time ago. i resonate with a lot of people in here, so i felt like i'd chip in a bit. i've essentially lived in complete isolation for 3-4 months now except to buy groceries on sick leave from my vocational school , only very rarely seeing family in that time. all social interaction is through online games not that this has ever really been much different , which i do think help ground me a bit more in reality. i know that some of you guys have gone years without even that, and i'm sorry to hear it. i want to get better, finish my education, have one or two friends, a roma tic relationship and a job. but life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen, seriously fuck living like this. i'm getting a little hope from knowing more about avpd and that i most likely am about to be diagnosed, so i can get help, but even still i've had times today where i just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. i'm scared of getting hurt so i've never attempted suicide, even though i've fantasized about it a lot. i also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family, sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear. anyways onto more non-death related shit, earlier i ordered food and have put a note to the delivery driver to just ring the doorbell and place it on the mat. i really hope they got the note, cause i look fucking terrible and struggle with taking regular baths. besides my apartment looks so bad i'd rather not have anyone look inside, so yeah kinda just hope to be able to pick up my food in peace. that's all i have for today, besides all the shit everyone here struggles with, i wish you the best possible day",4

"i am 17 and from london and all my life i have been living torturing myself without realising it. the way i think is so messed up and it stemmed from an early child, which i am regretful of not fixing. it is only since last year that i realised that there was something severely wrong with me. i do not have a sense of being a child because i have no friends and self isolated myself my whole life without knowing how affecting it is on a kid. i never went out during high school and i do not remember primary. during high school i came home straight after school and i did not even go out on weekends. and i had a totally warped perspective of school, where i took it too seriously. i did not realise anything wrong with this until this year or so and its haunting me. further more, i grew up quickly when i was young but it went far left. my mum passed when i was 9 and life just hit me hard and anything bad in my life was exaggerated due to this. like i was poor and that got to my head, that i was insecure about my clothes, now i just go out with those clothes, i was saddened that i could not have experiences or buy things like other kids. i have a lack of support system. my parents fully care about me and are overprotective but they never showed this love. like growing up they never gave me any advice or tips, did not take me anywhere like shops that normal parents do and i get really jealous when my friends talk about their experiences playing sports with their dad or going shopping with their mum. i do not know if this is neglect but i cannot balme my parents because they do care about me and at the end of the day they are not abusive. also, i got addicted to porn at a very young age, i am not sure when i started but i remember trying to quit at 12 years old. i remember this trip at school and i was just so stressed from watching porn because i was scared i was going to die. well it is 5 yrs on and idk dying. i probably started at 9. obviously this was probably an indirect attempt from my brain to soothe my pain from that time of my vicious life. but then i think the worst part is not the first half of my life where i lost my mum, my dad worked hard by himself, my stepmom came and worked hard for me eventhough she did not know me. the hard part for me is the 2nd half were i loved so blindly to torturing myself, i grief my childhood, i never felt like a child. i cannot remember any memories because of the high stress and i feel like i have lived a negative thousand years and i do not feel like a 17 year old. i have been going counselling since the beginning of this year and it barely helps. my whole life feels like an illusion. i never understood school for what it was, i never had a social life until i recently started developing one and i realised that the way i lived which i thought was normal for hurt teenagers was actually psychological torture. i cannot help to keep thinking that i have not lived yet even though i am 17 and it hurts. i am 17 and do not want to live anymore",6

"hello, i'm 22, female and from the uk. i'm kind of freaking out right now because i think something happened to me as a child. i don't even know, i'm sorry i wish i had something concrete to say but i don't think i could even type it out. the problem is i've recently moved to japan on my own and have no one to talk to here. i would normally talk to my boyfriend but he's not awake and i don't even know what i'd say to him - i don't even feel like i can say anything out loud even if i was with him.",5

"i have been trying for so long. told my family about my depression and they act like they care then forget the next day. i finally managed to ask for professional help from a doctor and my school. i am 15, my parents are divorced. i live with my mum and my dad lives some 2,000 kilometres away. i moved 2 times in the past year and due to that i lost my friends so i do not have anyone to rely on, and i am a year 9 so i friend groups and so on have been already made and i cannot really befriend anyone at this point. i have been struggling the past 3 weeks with anxiety and depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning for school. and to add to injury my mum is now saying i am going to go back to my dads and will have to start working and drop my education, which i do not want to do, and i do not want to make issues for my dad either as he is a driver so he drives 800km per day so he is rarely at home and barely gets sleep. i just do not know what to do at this point, talking about will not help since they will just act like nothing happened, and my dad cannot support me as he is over 2k km away, and he is not the best dad either but still cares enough to see that i am hurting and need help but cannot do much. i do not know why i am writing this and in such a weird way, i left out so many details but i do not want to make it too long. tl dr i am depressed, seeked help, person who cares cannot do much, broken inside and want to end it all. what to do next?",2
"what's wrong with me? insecurities i 27m had a horrible breakup 4 years ago and since then i've dealt with depression, suicidal thoughts, and very low self-esteem. i've been seeing progress in my mental state and i'd say i'm doing much better than the years since and have better coping mechanisms for my negative thoughts. however, there are some insecurities that are still with me. i've just met someone wonderful about 4 years younger than myself but i can't seem to properly love trust feel secure with this person. when she talks about traveling with her friends, i get turned off. it's like i only want her with me. i feel a sense of abandonment. also, i don't have any close friends like hers or i don't think i do. my ex called me a loner when we broke up and that's stuck with me. when this new girl talks of her successes i feel like shit again and get turned off. i want to be the alpha, i want to be successful and take care of her. i get attracted to broken people , maybe because i'm broken. i don't know if it's fair to her if i continue this relationship. i want a relationship but it seems that i'm not ready. i want a bestfriend. i know i'm wrong in my thinking, how do i fix myself. what do i do?",2

"how to get over anxiety fight or flight when people are in my personal space all the time?? hi everyone. i noticed my anxiety over the past couple months has gotten worse. i used to maintain decently w cbd here and there, but i find that i'm getting frustrated or my fight or flight is seriously kicking in for context, just shopping in a store the other day. i'm reaching for a can of food and my bf is near me. suddenly, a middle aged man w a cart barrels through towards me and an employee is inches from me, reaching for items directly below me. i suddenly moved so i wouldn't be touched or run over by this guy w the cart. no 'pardon me' 'excuse me', nothing. this morning i come to do my laundry at my local laundromat. i usually chat w a little old lady here but she usually gets in my personal space to clean literally crumbs from the floor. i am putting laundry in and i'm suddenly butt-to-butt with the laundry attendant, a woman comes in w a body bag sized laundry bag and almost hits me w it and i try to back up and the laundry woman is directly behind me, inches behind me i finished loading the laundry and went to my car for a deep breath. i called my bf to vent and he understands mostly how i feel. i also am starting to feel like an emotional burden to him. idk how to cope anymore. i feel like i'm on edge all the time. any tips would be amazing. i don't have health insurance so i can't be seen by a doctor anytime soon thanks for listening",0
"help i am 27 m . i am married and i have an amazing, loving and supportive wife. however, i am divorced. my ex-wife hurt me pretty bad, but not how most people would think. she had two sons and i happily raised them as my own and things were great. one day, she made the suggestion that i should get a vasectomy because neither of us wanted more children and we were both completely happy with our lives at that point. she didn't force me too, but i did it. i trusted my wife. i got the procedure . fast forward, one day, i find my wife in my bed with another man, such decency. we divorce, i lose everything, as most men do. i lose my wife, i lose my children that i raised from infancy, but aren't biologically mine, so i have absolutely no rights in the state i live in and i have never seen them since the day she left . i get married, i tell my now wife up-front about everything. she loves me anyway. i can't shake the feeling of what i have done to myself. to take it steps further, i work in child welfare. everyday, i see people who have children and they piss it away. i would give anything for that opportunity. i paid thousands for a reversal and it wasn't successful. i've never been a suicidal man and i've never felt any panic type emotions until all of this hit me in the face. everything i have done to myself. i know life isn't over, but i now have to face the reality that i could quite literally die alone... and i am 27. i've tried medicine, i've tried exercise, i've tried counseling, for months. nothing shakes this feeling of emptiness. i feel like i was set up and robbed, but what was taken was worth much more than money. i don't know who to call, i don't know where to turn.. i'm not even sure if this is the right place to be but.. i know my wife loves me. i just don't love myself anymore. i feel like the stupidest and most naive man to have ever lived. i trusted my wife. most 27 year olds, you know, they do stupid things. i've thought about suicide but not because i don't want to be alive. my parents just think i was stupid for ever making that decision. all i can respond with is, ""yeah, i was pretty stupid."" and that's it. i lay in my bed every night with a beautiful woman and i cry myself to sleep because i robbed myself and i robbed her and i can't cope with it. can anyone help me?",2

"lately i am been going through almost daily battling depression and i am not sure how to fix it. i would say i have had major depression not medically diagnosed for about 2 months now, but its been slowly growing over the course of 6 months when i could still function. i moved from east to west coast of the us and thought i would be fine when i moved. however the past 2 months of living alone has been extremely tough on me.i have days where i have some semblance of ""normalcy"" where i can cook prepare meals, clean, etc do stuff i need to . but most days as of lately are just me sulking about my life situation and i barely have enough energy to even get out of bed or stand up. so its those odd days that still keep me going. overall i have been having incredible feelings of dread , hopelessness , and aimlessness . dread because i have had this idea in my head of how i want to live my life, but nothing is the way i want it. after college i wanted to move abroad and live in an rural foresty area. but, currently i still live in the us and live in an urban desert arizona . i strongly feel like i do not belong here but i accepted the job anyways since i need experience out of college. i hate cities, hate the heat, and hate driving all things i have to deal with. hopelessness because i have many things i want to do and improve on. but cannot get myself to do them creating an endless cycle of berating myself. i distract myself with youtube, video games, and talking with friends which makes me temporarily happy but when i stop and realize where i am, i just break down. aimlessness because i do not know what to do with myself. even though i am working in a company that has nice and helpful co-workers managers i just do not care about the work and am only planning to stay here for 3 years to get experience. however, the 2 months i have been here the longer days feel. i thought i would make friends at work but am not putting in effort in making them, and so put myself in a lonely situation.i tried looking for therapy after i got insurance from my company but all have waiting lists since they are completely booked. i still apply anyways but am not hopeful for any help coming soon. depression worsening but feel lost on to fix it",2

"there is always light at the other end of the tunnel! just a little backstory i have had hypochondria that has steadily i creased in terms of severity, since late last november. over this period of time i have been worried about going deaf, having heart disease dying of a heart attack, going blind, having the hantavirus, having lung cancer, and the most recent one - skin cancer. throughout all of my fictional illnesses, even with the consideration of how rare they are to my specific case, i continued to believe i had them. i mean heck, i live in australia and there are only 15 cases a year of the hantavirus out of the whole country. didn t matter. my brain knew i would be in that 0.00000062 chance of getting it. although of this considerably unrealistic thinking, i still believe that deep down i knew i did not have the virus. enter, skin cancer. out of all of my fears, this one really stood out to me. i had an oh shit moment where i realised my petty fears before where nothing compared to this beast. due to the fact i am a relatively avid golfer who plays without sunscreen and typically without a hat, this fear was so real to me. book the doctors in, a 16 day wait i shit you not. in the beginning of this wait i was fine because my worries were on other things. however, approaching the date i developed absolute chaos inside of my head. i head to google and establish... yep... must be stage 4 skin cancer, this is the end. for the week i could not attend school, maintaining the fear there was a long road of chemotherapy, doctors appointments and eventually death, ahead of me. today i finally go in to the get the skin check. i was essentially prepared to have my life torn to shreds if i needed to get a biopsy, and then to wait for the results of said biopsy. doc looks at practically every mole on my body - nothing. no stage 4 cancer. no risk of death. just, nothing. although other worries have taken the limelight of the skin cancer, i maintain a sense of happiness and humour about how much i work myself up. how much i google every single one of my bloody symptoms. not just i however - we all do. this story was to simply let people know that there always light at the other end of the tunnel and i cannot say it enough - stop googling your symptoms. if you are really worried about something, get it checked up with your doctor asap and put your concerns put to rest by the professional!",0

"dear ,i am writing to you because i had a similar experience to yours in marchof this year,when i tried to end my own life. i am your grandmother's brother and imet youseveral times when you were much younger, although you probably won'tremember.first of all, i apologise for writing to you in english, but iunderstand that your knowledge of my mother tongue is far superior to myknowledge of french.i attempted to take my own life with an overdose of codeine andparacetamol but obviously my attempt failed and i spent eight days inhospital whilst they tried to rectify the damage i had done to my liverwith the paracetamol. thankfully they were successful, as i understandyour doctors were also successful in mitigating the damage you had doneto your own liver, which is wonderful, wonderful news.so we are both now living what i call our 'bonus lives'. i do not knowwhether you believe in a 'creator' or the notion of a 'guardian angel',but because i can find no rational explanation as to why i am stillhere, i do. i am not religious but my own journey through life has ledme to believe that god, or the creator, stands for everything that isgood in our world, following the example of the universe in whicheverything has an opposite good bad, night day, alive dead,positive negative etc. so i try to concentrate on everything that isgood and to reject everything that is bad, and i believe that most of usintrinsically know the difference. you may not believe in 'god', but i'msure you believe in 'good'.i understand why people decide they have had enough of this world andjust want peace from the pain and uncertainty and misery, because imyself felt that way. i had run out of money and my health is poor. ialso did not want to be dependent on others for my existence - i havealways been independent and i never much cared what other people feltabout me. i do not know your exact circumstances or what led you to tryto take your own life, but i do know that i felt the same way, a senseof hopelessness. i was tired and wanted it all to end. but just as foryou, my life did not end and i took that as a sign that my life was notmeant to end. even the doctors were very surprised that i survived. buti did survive and in spite of my own problems and we all have problemsto deal with i am now happy to let god life fate determine my departurefrom this world and for as long as my life lasts i will try my best tolive every day to the fullest. some days i am so exhausted that i canhardly get out of bed, but i do because i cannot predict what willhappen in the future and maybe, just maybe, i will feel better as theday progresses. and if not today, then tomorrow might be a better day.none of us knows what will happen in the future and the only advice ican give you is that we can choose ourselves whether to embrace anoptimistic perspective or a pessimistic perspective. as there is nothingto be gained from negativity it makes sense to be positive, even if thatmeans we will be disappointed on occasions. and just as negativethoughts can drag us further into the darkness, positive thoughts canhelp us find the light.i think one of the biggest lessons i learned from my own experience isthat i have a family and they care about me, just as you have a familyand they care about you, me included. however dark and black the dayappears when you wake up, you cannot know that the sun will not shinethrough later in the day. unlike me, you have your whole life ahead ofyou and from what your grandmother has told me, you have a great deal tolook forward to, especially being as intelligent as you are. life ishard for everyone, but it is even harder if you are stupid and you aremost definitely not stupid, so already you have something to be thankfulfor.so if you find that your own life is headed in a direction you are nothappy with and you feel there is nothing to look forward to, lean onyour family for support. no one is judging you, we only want to help inany way we can. sharing problems with others is very important becauseit enables us to obtain a different perspective on what is troubling us,one that we may not have considered when we tried to confront theproblem ourselves. knowing that there are people who really care for youis a source of great strength and you have an extended family who allcare about you and are there for you whatever the obstacles you face.you are not alone and there is no reason for you to face the worldall by yourself and try to make sense of it all. i am sixty-six years oldand i still cannot make sense of a lot of what goes on in the world, butit's the only world we have so we just have to try to live it as best wecan. even though i have my own problems, i have now shared them withothers and as a result, solutions have been found for most of them. ididn't imagine that could ever have been possible whilst i kept thoseproblems to myself, but once i shared them it became very much easier todeal with them and overcome them.i am sharing my experience with you in the hope that it might help youin some way to overcome your own difficulties. you are not alone andthere are more people than you might imagine who love you and who careabout you and who want you to be happy. i wish you a swift and completerecovery from your ordeal and if ever you want a shoulder to lean on orsomeone to just listen to what you have to say, i would be delighted tohear from you. this message, was sent to my sister who tried to kill herself, from my dad's uncle who has seen her a very few times a long time ago. it is important to me.",6

"when i am in a manic episode everything seems possible, i have so much energy i barely sleep 5 hours a day, i am working around the clock and compliments from my work-colleagues for my productivity is driving the manic state even higher. i go out clubbing and my altered self-esteem makes me appear more charming and attractive to women.as usually, a few weeks ago the lack of sleep physically degraded my body so much that life has collapsed like a house of cards again. i called in sick for a week, work piles up, my home became a mess, friends called me asking me for a reason why i am suddenly not responding to them - to ashamed to tell them that i am mentally ill they think i am just sick of them and they stop talking to me altogether which is accelerating depression even more.i am used to all of that but the reason why i am writing today is because in my manic state i met a wonderful girl at work. we laughed together, we partied together. we worked together. we became good friends and i fell in love with her - i never experienced love like that. and i lost her not because i am a psycho - which i am - i lost her because i shared my feelings for her and she did not feel the same way. at first - as a good friend would say - she assured me that this would not affect our friendship but after all she avoided being with me. i believe she started seeing me as just another guy hitting on her.what bothers me most is that she never even saw my depressive side, knowing that even my best was not good enough. sorry for this long post. struggling with manic depression for a few years now.",2
"the hollow self my life is spent largely devoted to work. between morning prep, commute, actual work hours, and evening prep like laundry, packing lunches, and other small maintenance tasks i only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. after all, i need to be in bed at a decent hour or else i won t be well-rested for the next work day. that s it. that s my life. meanwhile, even though i m so devoted to work that i sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it, i m barely earning enough money to survive. i have over 50,000 in debt that is slowly growing as i struggle to make ends meet. i don t know if i can ever pay it off. i can pay off maybe 1 3rd of it if i really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. i m turning 40 in 6 months. at what point am i supposed to go from surviving to thriving ? i know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but i just don t see the light at the end of the tunnel. what is my purpose? why am i grinding on the world s worst-ever rpg system? i feel like i m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year, and at some point i know i won t be able to keep up. my job itself is relatively easy, i m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. for the most part it s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at excel and power bi. though i don t know if i m that good at my job. tomorrow marks 1 year in this position, and every night i feel like i m doing the bare minimum. like i m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. i imagine they say things like, he s so slow. what s he even doing all day? or i better schedule this meeting because if i wait for him to do it, it ll never get done. they don t say these things out loud of course, and maybe they don t even think them but maybe they do. maybe i m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. i think i m ok because my head is still above water, but realistically if i keep doing this i will drown. i need to swim. i just feel like such a loser, all the time. i don t have kids, and i don t want them. i m not married, but i ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. we live together. she makes a lot more than i do, so she pays the mortgage and i pay everything else. it s probably not a fair arrangement for her, but i just literally don t make enough to split everything 50 50. she earns 40k more than i do a year. she would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. then we could split the 4th one, that would make it even. even with that justification in my mind, it makes me feel like a loser. not that she makes more than me- good for her! she deserves it! just that i can t contribute equally. i feel like a mooch. we work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. but her s pays more. them s the breaks i guess. overwhelming shame. about nearly everything. i m too fat. i m too bald. i m too old. i m not smart enough. i m not rich enough. i m not funny enough. i know those are called automatic negative thoughts , or ants, and like ants they should be easy to squash. i ve read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. i would go to therapy, but it s expensive. my company pays for 3 sessions a year. the other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die, i guess. is there more to this life? is this all i m supposed to do? click buttons all fucking day, sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show, then repeat? all day, every day, until i m old enough to scrape by on social security? this is it, huh? this is the whole fucking thing? there needs to be more, because i swear sometimes it just doesn t feel worth it. i m not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going? i have hobbies and interests, and i indulge in them as often as i can. i grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces, i hike in the woods and enjoy nature, there s so many things to occupy my free time if i had any- but the fact is i devote 87.5 of my day to making someone else richer. so my measly 3 hours a day- which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set- are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. i have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because i can t even be present to tend to my own garden. it s absolutely ridiculous. when exactly am i supposed to do anything of substance, of value? 3 hours in the fucking dark. that s what i get to live off of. most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt. 50,000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. meanwhile, i get to help analyze the company private jet spend. cost us over 365,000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. we paid 75,000 just in pilot fees for the month of january. i don t earn that in a year. so when i see how much money there is, how much is available to toss around, and just how little of it i get why would i work harder ? why would i sign up for more of this disrespect? i just don t know why. why can t i work 4 days instead of 5? why can t i be remote, considering i have only had 1 face-to-face meeting in the last month? i m wasting a ton of money on a car that i primarily use to get to work, a ton of money on a special wardrobe that i only wear at work it s absurd. and depressing.",4

"wondering if i was misdiagnosed no, i m not taking myself off of my meds. i ve been struggling a bit recently. 33f, diagnosed bipolar type unspecified 4 years ago. i have a clear history of depression going back to high school that i don t dispute. i was diagnosed adhd as an elementary schooler and again in high school good student but disruptive in class, incessant talker, impulse control issues, highly unmotivated unless i m interested in the subject, object permanence issues that persist today , medicated for it on and off, was prescribed a variety of medications and responded best to adderall, but i also have a touch of anxiety so dosing was finicky. treating the adhd diagnosis yielded some progress, but never addressed all of my issues. i was medicated for depression at various times with similar results, but notably was never treated for both diagnoses at the same time. edited a typo. four years ago i was unmedicated and my depression was the worst it had ever been. i started seeing a new psychiatrist, pried a bit into my family medical history both adhd and bipolar appear , and got a bipolar diagnosis. i ve been on trileptal and wellbutrin since then, and like before, i feel a little better than i did before the meds, but the issues aren t addressed. my symptoms are mixed, and i feel some degree of symptomatic obviously good days and bad ones every single day. my manic symptoms consistently spike in conjunction with anxiety flare ups, which are always traceable to a trigger. my sister 28f is diagnosed with depression and adhd and, when she describes how the combination affects her, it matches up to my constant mixed symptoms to a t. i ve started to wonder if i haven t been going at my mental health the wrong way, and i m extremely anxious about bringing it up to my doctor for fear of sounding manic. i don t think that i m healed or no longer in need of meds, and i don t plan on taking myself off of them. i also don t plan on asking for stimulants i m open to any treatment plan deemed a fit. but i have a lot of concern that i won t be taken seriously. has anyone been through anything like this? to be clear, i m not asking for commentary on a diagnosis! just seeking advice for broaching this subject with my doctor. part of me wonders if i might be best off trying to connect with a new one i ve raised concerns about my meds not being effective numerous times in the past and haven t really felt heard. but then i worry about the appearance of doctor shopping, and again, i m not actively seeking stimulants. anyway, any wisdom would be appreciated!",1

"what i am typing seems odd since i am sharing this on an online forum but still i just need help figuring this out.i sincerely cannot wrap my head around people, i do not know how to word this properly but i just get the sense i am the only human on this rock. i just cannot make myself understand or care for others, i feel happy certainly around maybe three people but even then it is the same happiness i feel with a pet. even then for me i do not have a problem with people dying, i understand life is precious and should not be wasted. but to the same degree as water or food should not be wasted, once it is gone no point in crying.i try to understand how social interaction works and yet it seems impossible, one thing i observed and mimic seems correct at times but wrong for others even in the same situation. i do not get why people feel or sense the things they do. i admit i have never been one for feeling, i see people as one sees a tool or item. it has a purpose and a use, some for pleasure and enjoyment and others to get what i need. and yet i am told this is wrong and it makes no sense. i do not exactly feel much, just analyze and try to figure out solutions. constant waiting and silence, studying and working to solve how i am supposed to talk or have others' perceive me. just mimicking what i think will help, never my own thoughts but what will please and give me a higher reward.as much as i hate people and those around me, i feel so lonely. a terrible emptiness at the idea that those around me wear faces like my own but are not similar to me. that i am the only soul. it is not that i am better but not the same? i am not saying i think of myself as an animal like a cat or dog but just alone. as hard as i try to connect and figure out why i think of people as objects and how to find humanity in humans. i cannot. i have had thoughts of just stopping with this game, to quit entirely. that the world and those who are forced to suffer my existence would be happier without me. like i am some machine that cannot be fixed, so why keep me around? yet, the greatest fear is not that it is the end or the pain created rather, that it does not stop. i have talked to my ""friends"" and yet i feel like it is just copy and pasted garbage, it is to be expected and as supportive as it is in sound, voice, and wording. it is empty and a farce to the fact they hate me. that everyone hates me and i am the one who is not human. am i evil?",2

"at this point in life i rarely truly worry about the swings and cycles, but my brain has been so unstable lately that i'm am worried. it's been a very rough past couple years and so many things have been affected by what's happened. to be clear i am not suicidal in any capacity. my cat would never forgive me and i do enjoy being alive even when it's chaotic and kinda terrible. i have basically been rapid cycling the past 11 months with a few intermittent bigger episodes, dealing with a very fresh ptsd development due to being in an abusive relationship with someone who in a psychotic rage beat a woman so bad he caved in part of her skull. he's in prison now but it doesn't erase the damage done to her or me. i had 6 months med access instability, 1.5 years of job instability, housing environment instability, other health problems ever tried to use your hands when you can't feel 80 percent of them? and these god damn hallucinations and crying spells really need to fking stop. i've been trying out more meds, different med combos, self-care, coping mechanisms. i've been in therapy and physical therapy and those are helping. i keep my appointments with my specialists and p-doc. i do my job the best i can and try to keep my shit together but i've been barely holding my head above water for such a long time with it all and i feel like i'm about to drown. no, correction. i feel like i'm drowning. i've been drowning for a while and i just realized it. i'm just trying to survive and it's getting harder and harder to do so. i'm bawling just typing this out. i did my taxes today and for the first time in the 13 years of paying taxes i authorized someone else to talk to the irs if necessary. i wrote down my important login information. i've been talking to my dad and my sister about the gist of everything. i know my sister will take care of my cat if i can't, i've already gone over all of annie's overall care and needs especially regarding her medical care and environmental needs. i need a fresh start. there are too many ghosts in this area that haunt me and my dreams. i've had too much loss and trauma to call it home anymore. i want to move up north to the only place i can call home. i want to move into my dad's place and live with one of the few humans i trust. i brought it up today and he's thinking about it. i will see what his thoughts are about it later. i can't stand how things are anymore and i need to be better. in addition to my lithium, lamictal, vyvanse, buspirone, propranolol and gabapentin, i started vraylar last week but it's not working fast enough so i start olanzapine tomorrow. maybe it will help me. i'm really hoping it will help me because i can't hold it together anymore, not even for my cat. i hate and despise my brain with the fury of a thousand bonfires. i wish i could be normal. i wish i was blissfully unaware of how any of this feels. i spent most of my 20's learning how to handle bp and to become and stay stable. but apparently my early 30's are having a laugh at what i managed to achieve. edit my dad said yes. i'll be moving mid-may after a few appointments and finalizing everything. i'm going to be paying cash for my meds for a little while until i can get on medicaid, but that's okay. i'm hoping to fill my meds as soon as my insurance lets me up to 5 days before the days supply ends so i can build up extra. maybe try to get a vacation override or something towards the end. i'm gonna work some extra shifts to build up some money. i gotta get annie to the the vet for her annual exam and refills of her phenobarbital. and ask the vet if she will authorize an early refill or prescribe a larger volume so there's more of a buffer zone for her because her seizures are both heartbreaking and terrifying at the same time . i have so much to do! i have more hope again. god damn i love my dad. he's always been beyond awesome and supportive, he has been one of my biggest supporters in multiple ways over the years. i legitimately don't know if i would be here typing this if he wasn't who he is. i had some happy tears today and i'm like to think they outweighed all the sad and angry ones that i've had lately. edit 2 honestly this post doesn't even mention many of the other things, like the rage i have felt for sometime, a brief hope and desire to date someone. a miscarriage i still mourn and how i never told him that i named her. the depth of complexity and severity of my nerve, skin and gut problems and how much money has been spent on them. or how i stopped loving my job because i hate the place i work and my coworkers are a pack of wolves who i've tried to hide weaknesses from. or that i've just been so tired for so many years.",1
"can anyone please save me from myself i can't do this anymore. this constant feeling of self hatred, the dissociation, the want to isolate. i've shared my story many times without a single person noticing or helping.. i've dedicated so much of myself to helping others not feel the way i feel. i've gone to therapy, i've picked up hobbies, and i've done all the things they say will cure depression yet here i am lying in bed, having called out of work again. i didn't think i'd ever feel this way again, but i just want to die. i want to disappear. i want to be forgotten about. i've gotten rid of all my friends, my girlfriend just thinks i'm sick and i feel like i can't share my deepest feelings with her because of the stress she already goes through, my parents don't speak with me. i feel like if i'm not doing something for others they don't want me... all this yet i'm too afraid to die it's pretty pathetic.",2
"i hate my life so much. no social life till 27, like back in the days of kindergarden, our teacher literally begged other children to at least try to befriend me and not exclude me from all their activities. and still got marginalized, had 0 friends, got bullied a lot. but still was a cheerful person till i moved out of my parents house and went to uni.and when things started to turn for the better, guess what? covid happened. isolation again. the fact that i live in a literally shit country romania made it even worse. what hurts me the most is the impossibility to find a romantic partner. tried every dating app possible, went to every social event after restrictions were lifted, literally trying hard to check all the boxes and no success. not a single chance.also tried therapy counselling. did not help at all. one can tell me "" do this do that and you will eventually find someone"". i just cannot do it , i am too menrally exhausted to try it anymore and i feel i am condemned to live this both dream and nightmare stuff called life- dream because every other aspect in my life is on point and going absolutely perfect. but there is this social aspect that gives me suicidal thoughts every day.the only thing i can do is being an aggressive troll on the internet. if i said something bad to about you, sorry i did not mean it. it is the unending frustratiin that speaks for me. sometimes i wish i had a terminal disease and know i will certainly die very soon",6

"honestly, not even sure what i want to say. kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. not post-partum depression. i have struggled with self-hate ever since i was kid. i believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. there just really is not much to like. not soon after it became depression and i have just lived my life like this. i am married and have 2 kids. just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. being depressed as my doctor explained is usually from outward influences. depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. but yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, i have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. really, i have no idea what i want to say. i guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. you may think that those things will help you i did but they do not. instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. anyway, i recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. it was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. and i am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but i am waging a war with myself. get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. personally the latter seems like the better option but then i think about what it would do to him in the future. would he really think i loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? so i am getting help instead. there is so much more i want to say about having depression and being a mother, but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that, so yeah. it sucks, but get help. where to start",2

"i have gotten better with depressive thought spirals like this over the years. i know i have. and this time, i have just been countering the thoughts with other thoughts, about all the good which i know is there, all the reasons i have to be alive, all the things which i have concrete plans to do once things get better because i am going to fucking force them to be better even if i have to improvise .but goddammit everything is just too much. the chronic pain. the medical neglect. the constant anxiety because i am in the presence of my parents because i fucking live here and i will have to continue living here for 2 years minimum, which is simultaneously a lot and barely anything at all, but so much can happen and i am always at the verge of hyperventilating. i think the peak of summer heightened the neglected pain as well, which ended up...... everything is on a precarious sort of balance and is about to collapse. i am about to collapse.i have almost collapsed and actually collapsed many times before and i do not fucking want it to happen again even though my brain keeps saying, ""down a bottle of poison"" what poison? family regime outlaws pretty much any effective medicines and all i have is a bottle of hand sanitizer, which would not actually kill me and i am not going to fucking do it so why must the thought keep coming back .i know how to fight against the thoughts, and now that, ""remind yourself of why you need to stay!! your creative projects are worth more than your problems!!"" is getting exhausting because i do not have enough good things to counter the bad things with i am going with the distraction strategy, but goddammit i am so so so tired. i am so tired, i feel like a trapped animal bleeding out on the street, i am just fucking exhausted. i just want to,,, un-suicidal my brain",6

so the next fall is deeper and harder to bear each time there s one little glimmer of hope i know that it s ephemeral and could be gone the next day but i can t stop myself from getting lost in it thinking maybe this time it could be real for a while and some time it doe lurking there for a while like just right then but when it s lost it s going down ten time worse than the last and the anxious and unbearable state i m in is urging me to destroy myself even more it s like being locked inside a transparent box full of insect and reptile crawling over me it s slowburn and icky and suffocating i just want to bite my tongue off quick to release myself from the situation but i m still scared of the monstrous pain that act would cause me and if i m not dead immediately it s grotesque i made a first post here a while ago just to let it out i don t think anyone would care but i got called a very nasty stupid word like i m always afraid would happen if i even complain in real life so i don t even want to talk about it right now i just can t take any more anxiety i don t even want to think about it and write them down anyway same shit all over again why don t i get used to it when it keep happening am i that weak it s like how dare you have depression and suicidal attempt if your life look like you re having a fucking blast believe me it s all a big facade i m putting up so i could delay the speed of this horrible decay inside me to feel a bit bearable to last one more day but nowadays i just stop giving a fuck and destroy everything in my life and lock myself inside my room i use humor and shit to cope so i think at least there s one good thing coming from this right now is that i couldn t eat a thing so i m getting thinner to bone and skin like i always wish and if i die right now i could look prettier than ever before i m glad you read until now and i do appreciate that it make me feel a bit bearable for now my anxiety level keep shooting through the roof i just try really really hard to not harm myself and fall to the pit again,2

the number one reason i m severely depressed is the fact that i can never get a foothold in life i m like this powerful rocket on the launch pad that never take off rocket have phenomenal thrust potential but they need a team of people to actually allow it to succeed at what it wa built for i need friend i need family i need people to actually work with me i m year old and have yet to find a foothold to allow me to ascend the mountain for success i ve worked so hard i ve worked countless hour i ve dedicated my heart and soul to excellence i even started my own company a few year ago but a company can not simply run itself you need client investor and people that actually believe in what you re doing in order for that to reach it fully potential i have all this stored up explosive thrust yet no way to get any of it off the launch pad i can have all the desire integrity energy die hard spirit and tenacity however i can t do it alone in a world of untapped potential i feel absolutely isolated and alone i m incredibly intelligent and resourceful yet i m still broke financially and can t ever find a way to get a leg up it take more then one person to succeed i can t continue to give 000 while this world turn a cold shoulder to me and give nothing in return it doesn t and can t work that way so yeah i m depressed and teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown because life isn t working with me it s constantly working against me and to my ultimate demise,2

this is my first reddit post also my first time sharing this information with anyone but i can t really keep it in anymore man so bear with me hopefully there s a psychiatrist out there that will read this and hit me with some world altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell i will ever tell anyone especially not a doctor or psychiatrist what you are about to read but i really just need to get this out there first and foremost no im not going to kill myself let s get that out of the way but i do think im depressed i wa telling myself it wa just a life slump for a long time then i wa telling myself it wa just sadness from the slump now i ve literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i got ta talk about it with someone even if someone is this phone screen i ve always had major self esteem and confidence issue not really sure what it stem from but i have always felt inferior to those around me which btw i can not believe people live life happy with their appearance that is a blessing that people take for granted anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and i believe that over the past few year a mix of rapid lifestyle change and stress related event ha caused me to have depression the part that confuses me is that while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of thing i don t feel like it s a bad life to live i have wonderful friend family i have a great scholarship to a good school i do fun thing and go to party and drink i feel like an average person put in my shoe would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passion at all which i do not probably why i fuck everything up all the time it is common for me to have suicidal thought i really don t know why since in reality i wouldn t want to kill myself i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm i am self aware of these thought and i have attempted breathing and thought altering method to get rid of them but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger it physically hurt they are not always about suicide but they are always very negative targeted at myself i just can t help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nut to finally end it all sometimes i can t look at myself in the mirror because i know it ll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me and a sad a it is to say it i really just do not like myself i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy im and im physically fit but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different there have been a few instance in recent month of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can t i literally can t i don t see it i don t know where you guy are looking but i truly don t see what you see okay it s not just about my appearance i find myself annoying and awkward i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes but behind my smile is most commonly a frown im fucking annoying my thought scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect i talk too much sometimes i say thing i dont even mean or agree with just to say something i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot im volatile and irritable and ugh i fuck up most thing i do work school relationship you know how it go the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal something about the way i wa made is just wrong i guess that s another one of those negative thought that repeat in my head a lot born wrong today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself beating my own face in felt great honestly wish i could ve made it a reality i can t find happiness in any of the thing i used to enjoy ive gradually stopped all my hobby except for the gym which is where i take my anger out usually i have a lot of that i can t even sit through a movie without thinking what is the point of me doing this what is the point life feel numb pointless i go about my societal life just like everybody else i study work play sleep rarely but it all feel the same a gray bland mesh of nothing even something like eating delicious food i just don t get enjoyment anymore the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone make a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh honest opinion of myself i fucking suck im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck i constantly make poor decision and can t seem to learn from previous one im ugly the only thing im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself i say dumb shit and get shit on for it what kind of asshole ha the privilege and opportunity that i have and is still sad and lazy like this im the type of person that wa actually just wired wrong in the head and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can t disgust me to be honest i don t even know who i am a few month ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is i replied nothing i don t have one i really don t have a talent or something im good at and seeing people around me do amazing thing and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurt i do not feel like this id say about 0 of the time i forget about all my stress and worry and appearance and fuck ups and im actually happy then when the happy go away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all come flooding back im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless high and happiness that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them the question i find myself asking often is why why am i doing this why do i feel this way why did i say that why did i do that why am i a certain way yadda yadda i am a realist i also truly believe there is no point to this life why do we all live such stressful unrewarding life putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever i read comment on post like these saying that life is beautiful meet everyone you can experience nature get help it get better it can get better but the thing is no it can t everyone s situation is different i guess but where im at and what im doing nothing gon na change im not going anywhere even if i wa it wouldn t matter societal standing and fancy job position mean nothing human are not made equal everyone is different special in their own way therefore some people are biologically and factually better than others whether it s stronger larger smarter faster people are different and some trait are preferable i just happened to get stuck with the trait that make me fucking suck at life no amount of meditation or antidepressant fuck big pharm is going to change who i am people don t change painting a leopard red doesn t remove his spot it just hide them temporarily well it s and im going to the gym at and then lecture after that so i guess i should sleep a few hour so my motor function stay working so i can keep going on in this endless cycle of pointless effort thanks for

"just as pretext i am not looking for support. i am just posting this at 12 30 am to rant make something maybe relatable.life is sick as fuck if you think about it. all this shit you can do and achieve. so much to learn and experience. life however is also very superficial and does not actually provide anyone with anything concrete. what i mean is that everything we do here is trivialized by the fact that we are going to die.now if we knew for a fact that doing stuff here grants you some benefits for doing all this shit--all of this would maybe make sense. this of course is not the case and we are all doing what we are doing for zero reason.so yes life might sound to many as this cool adventure that everyone needs to experience. myself though i think everyone should know how irrelevant it is to push themselves so hard, when the reward is more than a huge slap in the face. life is a cool concept, but it is not executed well",6

"hi, i am going to try to not make this too long, but, for the past year or so i have been feeling horrible. my whole life i have always struggled with thinking about doing it, but always convinced myself that i have it so well. but, long story short, since last quarantine i built up a really good youtube channel with over 60k subscribers and a loyal fanbase, but its really all too much. so many people have said horrible things to me, i see people say mean things about my appearance and voice, even in places where they would not think id see it, they just post it. i see people reply to cringey comments i have made 2 years ago like oh hey did not expect to see you here and it freaks me out. i feel like i always have eyes on me and i am not built for this. like the title says, i am only 16, and all this youtube stuff built on top of my already existing depression has me feeling left with no other option. and yes, i have tried quitting, silently though, i did not announce my departure and people just got mad that i did not upload and started to unsubscribe. it suuuucks. idk what to do anymore, thanks for reading this if you did, that is about it. i do not think i am going to ever do it, but i cannot go a single day without thinking about it. alright bye. 16 and in a tough rlly specific situation",6

"your honest opinions, please! ok, so i have struggled with hypochondria for going on three years now. last night, my girlfriend was puppy sitting for a coworker, and i stopped by to bring dinner and hang out with the cute puppy, for a while. as puppies do, he was a little bit of a biter, and at one point he got in a little deep just above my elbow on my bicep. i pulled my arm away but it dragged a little bit and drew a little blood, so i assumed it punctured the skin. he's only a few months old, and apparently he went to the veterinarian four days ago. i haven't confirmed that he got a rabies vaccination there. i think he would have, but i don't remember what all my dog got when i took him home two years ago. this puppy who bit me came from a shelter. so, please tell me honestly should i be worried about rabies? should i go to the doctor just in case? i could use a level head's perspective on this.",0
"from a young age i have loved cars, i wanted to build a career out of my love and passion for them. i had dreams and goals centered around them.after getting kicked out of home and was forced to move to far away from automotive school, with no transport, i slowly began to lose interest and not focus on my passion as much.i did eventually get a car, and the passion somewhat came back, but not entirely, not like it used to be. i stalled going to school to pursue my career because i was getting really depressed and started drinking heavily. i was lost. i still wanted to try pursue my goals eventually though.after witnessing my friend get into bad car crash, trying to pull him out of his car, and thinking he was dead, i began to lose interest even more. after crashing my car, i lost even more interest. hearing of so many car crashes, death, accidents... but what sealed the deal was when, a few months ago, i was with a friend and he was working on his car, when the jack slipped out from under it and crushed his arm. i luckily noticed the jack slipping out and he got out just in time before the car could, well, crush and kill him... what if i was not there? what if i had been looking away for a few seconds and did not notice? he would be dead... i have known him 15 years. it is given me ptsd. now it feels like i have completely lost my love for cars. i just do not see them the same, only as a mode of transport, and a ticket to death. i still like them, but it is just not the same.now i completely do not want to pursue a career in automotive anymore, or my goals of building, modifying, and racing cars. which has been what i have wanted all my life. that passion has just completely disappeared. it sucks. i have completely lost interest in the one thing that that i truly loved and was passionate about.",2

"first i am going to present you with a few questions that you can answer on your own. after i will provide you with what i went through, before i begin, i would like to tell you have severe ptsd but no depression.1 why are you sad kind soul? are you not loved? do you not have a single person in your life who cares so much about you and dislikes reverently to see you upset?2 why are you allowing other peoples actions and choices to dictate how you feel? do you not realize the control you have given them over your mind, heart, and choices that only you have the ability to dictate action you make? 7 billion people in the world and 1 person who you thought cared about you but has proven beyond reasonable doubt they do not, so why do you care what a fraction of a penny to a million dollars thinks?this is why i cannot rationalize depression. who gives a damn what other people think about you? not when there is so many people you have yet to meet and get to know who would give their life freely to save your own. not everyone is this way, why allow people to turn you away from love of someone you never met? do you not allow them to win at this point in time? is that not laying down and accepting defeat in every measure. you have given them control over who you are. break free of it, some people are truly evil scum and this is what they want. they want you to feel worthless, how many people right now can ask a friend this ""hey, i feel alone can i talk?"" personally i do not have it but with online friendships and a few real-life friends. i went from being known in all of california, to being hated by everyone because of slander. so instead of giving up, get back up, do not stop that drive in you to be kind. suicide is not a answer to any form or self pity, self loathing, or self hatred. killing yourself will only hurt those who truly care about you. if you die can you share your story? no! you damn well cannot, so instead of realizing that struggle is growth and growing from a mistake, whether it be from how you may have treated innocent people when you were down and out, or maybe it was how you were treated when you needed a shoulder to cry on? indifference is not the answer, you are loved by someone! past, present, or furture tense! remember you could be a drive to someone later, a story that if you quit on or recluse on that you have already that that which plagues you win. life is not easy, let me share 11 years of my life, i know from personal experience that life is difficult. yet, i refuse to give up, mama did not raise no bitch or a quitter.sept 17th 2012, prior to that date someone who was called a friend but proven he was not used my name to put a ms13 member in jail facing 1000's of felony charges. that person was facing life in prison without the possibility of parole. i did not know about the hit on my name. a hit is a contract to kill someone. on the above mentioned date, i was overdosing on 26 drugs, four times the lethal limit. i also had enough acid in my system to because that test result to come back beyond blood red. i blew a 3.14 bac level. the people who did it went against a description to attempt to kill me. i had calico hair and brown eyes, olive skin tone. the description was a white ginger kid with blues eye. they kid napped me and attacked me repeatedly. well my advise to all, if you want someone unconscious or cooperative why in the hell would it be a good idea to drug them with pcp? in short, i did not feel a thing. they eventually put a gun to my head after three horrific failure attempts to knock me out. me being me and with who i know told them to "" do it"". i had them call my closest friends so i knew that in killing me that everyone there would be dead with me. i presented them with this logic, they put the gun back down and decided to try their luck with punches again. every time they had turned around prior i was being fed information, this time i did not wait i had what i needed. i allowed wrath to hit my voice, they trembled, as the passenger reached for the gun i hit him hard enough to put him in a coma for 7 days. i turned to the driver and present him with two options drive me to the town near where i lived, or i will beat you down to a pulp. from knowledge prior that night i knew he had a gun in his door panel never brag about where you keep loaded guns . he repeatedly kept saying ""ok! ok! i will do it as he reached for the gun and i could see it plain as day. that second the his hand touched the gun i hit with with everything i had. i shattered his right side of his jaw to such a extreme he had to go into surgery to get it fixed. i laid back and felt sick, i am not a fan of harming people and at that point i was exhausted. thankfully i hit him hard enough that i was able to rest for fifteen minutes and eventually stumble out of the car and run. i came across a navy personnel who was driving down the road. i ran into of him and screamed for help. finally, he got out and he said ""what is wrong, what happened?"" i was so exhausted and afraid i could barely tell him. when i managed to he dialed 911. i was taken to the hospital, it took 8 hours with no narcan to get it out of my system. i used the restroom twice, had a bottle of gatorade and a bottle of water to drink. i was not allowed to sleep. i was in psychosomatic state of mind and was not hallucinating prior to being there. when my urine analysis came back i was informed and it hit like a ton of bricks. walls melted and shifted violently, the floor rose up like ocean waves, i just wanted to be home. i was alone and afraid, no use of my phone was allowed or any phone for that matter. when i talked to the detective in charge of handling the case, i was threatened with if the person i put into a coma died i would face man slaughter charges, that i should be happy that i was not being charged with assault and battery on the person who is jaw i broke, i was still tripping. i pointed out the fact that the evidence gathered from that vehicles dash cam proved it was self-defense.. i got a response of "" i do not care"". funny because i am 7.4 balkan and 14.9 scandinavian. when i told her that she did not like it and said we shall see about that. in the end the case was thrown into a incinerator, all because i could not bring them to the point of kidnapping. yet, we have tech that allows us to trace cellphone signals.. i told her my number and she refused to it. i gave her names of everyone there, told her to call netherland's spec ops who were there to protect me, nothing was done... i told her to her face this ""you are a cunt, you are a corrupt piece of trash and that i would stop at nothing until i had everyone even remotely affiliated with what had happened dead before a firing squad, even swore to god"".... well people who know me know i keep promises, especially to god. i finally have called everything into question, now its time for hellfire and brimstone. i should be depressed, i should have so many issues and i truly thank god for getting me through it. believe in what you want its your choice. this is a factual story and really did happen. it is not all i went through. 11 years of my life dedicated to hunting everyone even remotely affiliated, the more i found out the sicker to my stomach it made me. raped and child molestation, direct connections to the federal government. i never thought for a second it would be that deep. i had no real clue as the truth of how far the rabbit hole went down. i went to the bottom, and came back up. never allow anyone to change who you are, you are far more valuable when you have respect and love then to become like them. the only way people will ever beat you is when you give into what they want. youtube aggressive motivational speech, picture of a lion. i helped write it and spoke my piece. something i feel needs to be shared",2

"this is ruining my life. i need to make a change. title says it all. this is ruining my life and making me feel like life isn't even worth living. all i do is obsess and worry and browse the internet. i'm 27 f, and in the past week i have gone from worrying about brain tumours to ms to early onset parkinsons to liver cancer, blood cancer, meneire's disease, diabetes, and other illnesses. i've been like this my whole life. i don't even know why, but ever since i've been a kid i've been worried about my health. i was a semi sick child, but nothing life threatening or horrible. i have been seeing a therapist off and on since i've been 14 and it does help, though i haven't gone in a few weeks. 2 months ago i began getting vertigo. doctor told me it was an inner ear problem, and the whole thing made my anxiety completely spiral out of control. i haven't stopped thinking about whats wrong with me or worried about not being dizzy for longer than 15 minutes in the last 10 weeks. the room spinning vertigo is gone, i'm just left with some random dizzy spells and disequilibrium unsteadiness. i was convinced the doctor missed something, so they agreed to do some blood work and booked an mri. they don't seem overly concerned but said they will do it. i'm waiting for the mri, but just got news back from my bloodwork. apparently it's all normal expect for my b12, which is elevated cut off is 950 and i'm 1048 .. this is pretty unusual, since b12 is normally low if anything. i have been taking b12 supplements, so i'm going to try to assume that's what caused it the nurse told me about the blood results and the doctor has yet to follow up, so i don't know what to do about it besides stop taking the supplement but of course my crazy self went on google and found out high b12 can be indicative of blood or liver cancers and is really serious. cue freak out. i'm just done. i'm so done living like this. i don't know what the follow up will be for the b12, if anything, but i'm just going to be sitting here wanting to browse the internet in hopes of making myself feel better when in reality i never will. i will sit here and think about every bodily sensation and worry about feeling off balance, and worry about something sinister going on and picturing all the horrible scenarios that are going to happen and how i'm going to die young and suffer and leave my children motherless. amp i just have to make a change. even if i do have blood cancer or liver cancer my current fear , there isn't anything i can do about it. it's not like worrying is going to make it go away, so why do i do this to myself? i can't do another day like this, searching for answers and being constantly scared. i've booked an appointment with my psychologist for this wednesday and i am vowing to myself to get off google and never go back on for answers. i don't know what else to do yet, but i feel this is a good start. amp anyone people who have cured their health anxiety who have tips? or just any commiseration out there is helpful too.",0

"hi folks.i am 31 and have had depression since i was 16, tried different antidepressants and currently on one. there is nothing really wrong in my life, i have trauma but does not everyone. i am just so sad and tired like mentally and sometimes physically it is hard to get myself to do anything but i still do stuff, i think i could be called high functioning even though my depression has been moving from mediocre to severe. sorry if this does not make sense, english is not my first language. i have good days hours minutes but after the good moment passes this emptiness and heaviness comes and it feels like it consumes me. i am looking for a therapist but that seems too much sometimes. most are also too busy to take on new clients.what else is there other than this, this depressed life where i either feel so depressed or wonder if i am just making it up. how do i get out of my head and into my life. how do i do anything like see a friend without dreading it at first because after hanging out, even if i had a great time, i will most likely get sad and beat myself up, ""i am stupid, i did x and that was bad"". i am someone else around a friend and i do not know if i want to be that person 24 7 or never. i wish i had friends i liked always, i do not want to sometimes hate them but sometimes i do. i would never tell them because it is not like they did something horrinly wrong. most times my hate stems from the friend just saying something that i did not like. and i never tell them that. just in my head i go i do not want to be friends anymore. but irl i just keep the convo going, smiling, acting like nothing.everything is like a chore. i just want to enjoy life and be content. i feel so alone and so suffocated. i just wanted to let this out. will i ever not have depression?",2

"i have 30 paracetamol tablets 500mg currently next to my bedside. i am male, 22 years old, average height, and maybe a little over my recommended body weight. this feels like the easiest way out available to me but i have read that it is slow amp painful and could lead to permanent damage when unsuccessful. i have been thinking about ending things for a while now. honestly, in the past it was just a distant thought for the most part and i could just ignore it when i would think about it but over the past year and a half i have pretty much spiralled down to probably the darkest point in my life and it is pretty much all i have been thinking about. i feel like i am just a failure who has burned any potential future i had ahead of me, and i have even driven away close friends because of my poor decisions and my sometimes chaotic behavior recently. i really hate myself rn and am so disappointed in what i have amounted to. i have lost pretty much all motivation i had. the thought of suicide is starting to feel less abstract and more like a real potential outcome everyday. but the more real it feels the more i feel like there is no easy way out and i am scared of surviving and living with permanent damage to myself. a few months ago i tried cutting myself, but never even went deep enough to make a real threat to my life. i was confident i would be taking these pills only a few hours ago, but now that seems unlikely to me after reading more about it. i am kind of scared. idk what to do. i never really thought this would be me, like feeling this way and posting on a forum like this. but here i am. feeling desperate and defeated and i guess i am realizing i am going to be here a little longer. so i just need to get this off my chest as i do not really have anyone i am comfortable or confident enough to talk about this with irl. i am not really looking for a specific response or encouragement telling me not to do it but i do not mind any response. i just feel like i need to let these thoughts out into words and put them somewhere outside of my head. no easy way",6

"so i had an okay day today. but of course that did not last when does it ever? i got in a fight with my mom as usual. every time we fight i feel a little of myself die inside. now there is basically nothing left of me. i noticed since i have become suicidal that i think about life a lot. like not just what i want to do, and how i want to live that is if i do not off myself first lol but like in a bigger sense like why are we humans here? what is the point of us existing. basically i have become very existential. so as i think of life as a whole everything really seems empty and pointless. like even if i lived my idea of a perfect life i think id still feel empty inside because what is the point of anything really?i feel like this is not something you can even tell someone in real life because they will think you are suicidal. which i am i know but when i become existential and think of mankind as a whole and all that i am not suicidal. like its a different feeling then when i want to die because my life sucks and when i am existential i just do not want to exist on this plane of existence because like what is the point. do you get what i am saying!?anyway i feel like this is not something humans are supposed to think about. like if you say you do not want to exist because what is the point people will tell you your suicidal and that is wrong to want to die. but why should not i want to not kill myself? why if i see how meaningless and small life is and do not want to be involved in it its wrong and i am supposed to seek help. then after i get help and get fixed and do not want to not exist anymore i am back in the endless cycle of pointless life. like what is so wrong if wanting to opt out of this world?anyway i hope this makes sense i am tried its late my souls broken and battered. i just really needed to vent. just a little rambling",2

"i am really depressed, i had some kind of massive childhood trauma trigger a while ago when a similar feeling situation happened, only realised what it was recently. i have two partners we are poly, it is chill . one thinks i am draining while i am like this and left for a month, the other tries to be there but i cannot stop snapping at her when i am feeling at my worst and she comes into my space i hide under the duvet a lot . that is not something i want, so i need distance.i have to work through the whole spectrum of child abuse and i do not feel safe talking to anyone now that i know i drain them. i am really not sure how i can keep going, somehow keep both jobs, be more functional, find any kind of social contacts to try and do happy things, while being alone. the one that left will come back in a few weeks, the other is still around, but i am unable to share when i feel overwhelming things, i do not want to lash out if she is prodding and saying the wrong things.idk what to do. i guess it would help to have any idea how to make friends to do things with. i am autistic and really struggle. i am seeing a therapist but all of the processing is just making me so much worse. both partners distant while trying to deal with childhood trauma",2

"misplaced guilt, but still not a great feeling. i have been trying to avoid reddit lately because it just is not a lot of fun the way i use it. would be better if i could somehow meet people through this, but something about meeting people online just weirds me out a bit. not because i think i will meet weirdos, more that it is just hard to believe that anyone will care about me. i feel like i really do not have a lot to offer. and with ""internet friends"" not that i have ever really had any , it seems like it would be too easy for either of us to ghost, and i would never see them again. if it was someone who lived in my city in australia, who could actually be a real-life friend, that would be something. i mean i would still worry about being too depressed to be worth it.and to be honest, making friends is not really a priority for me until i find a partner. but anyway.i have this throwaway account and a regular one. i do not know what is up with the reddit notification system, but i just scrolled back through out of boredom, and between both accounts i have like 4 messages from people. all from like a year ago. some of them were answering me responding to their r4r post. girls my age who might have been something for me.i did not see any of those fucking messages and i feel awful about it. i could have been happier by now. i could have met someone. guilt about social avoidance",2

"lamictal brain edit my doctor already agreed that i can try a lower dose of lamictal, but he generally lets me decide what i want to do when it comes to meds since nobody else could figure me out. please stop deleting this. so basically med-induced stupidity is ruining my life. being smart is my thing, it s the only thing i have going for me pretty much. i ve been labeled a genius with a 140 iq for my entire life and now i can t do basic math. i m freaking out, it s so bad i might actually flunk out of school at this rate. i ve been on lamictal for years and always knew it made my memory and cognition worse, but it never was that big of a problem because i wasn t doing anything that hard. all of that changed this year when i went back to studying computer science in college, something that i was always good at. but now i can t do anything, and i mean that. i can t remember anything for more than ten seconds, it takes me 10x how much time it should for me to learn anything and my brain just doesn t work. i m a month behind in both of my stem classes. even when i was in a mixed psychotic episode i was 10x smarter than this, hell even when i was hospitalized i was smarter than this! so i know for sure that it is the meds causing this, not the disorder itself. i m scared of stopping it completely but i want to at least try cutting the dose. my psychiatrist agreed that it could potentially help, but he also pretty much said he doesn t know much about it. i used take 400 and going down to 200 helped a little, so i m planning on going down to 100. has anybody successfully regained some of their brain power by lowering their dose?",1

"i consider myself emotionally and thus mentally weak. despite financial success, having a few relationships in my life and other qualities that i do not know even count anymore, even with all the therapy in the world, i will never lose the fact that i am weak. i will always have an emotional side that is a hair trigger away from engaging at any point in my life, high or low. emotions, despite whatever women say are fucking kryptonite to women... our world is so fucked and we are transforming it so that we cowtow to the less than 1 , inclusivity, equality, men are women and women are men but our biology is our biology. men are overwhelmingly attracted to women and vice versa and our biology dictates that no matter how much the powers are trying to fuck with the script, gender roles especially, of how we are to societally be or anecdotes that are raised, security is something that women will be exclusively disproportionate in needing. you cannot have security in a man that is depressed and is not always the rock and could potentially break down at something like the irrational thought of his parents dying and not being around even when they are perfectly healthy.depressed men emotionally weak men do not have a 100 ratio of being the rock, the security that woman, if applicable, runs away to the candy store of infinite options of men, that will run to her with the snap of the finger and she knows this man, not fulfilling his biological purpose of reproduction and being attractive to the opposite sex, gets severely depressed and either falls under the rug to remain invisible forever or goes into the dirt.we have to remember that men not being open about emotions, is more than likely it not being societally acceptible for him to do so, rather than it just being ""me man, me have no emotion. me strong"". he bottles it and suffers in silence and dies younger. am i fooling myself in thinking that if i build on all other functions of my life that i will find a woman that will accept depression and weakness or am i doomed to repeat the same sick pattern of women sticking around for a few years and then eventually leaving... philosophic thoughts - opinions needed is there room for weak men?",2

"when i am asleep my dreams are perfect. i am happy. whatever goes wrong in my life is fixed or manageable. i have everything i want. but that means falling asleep crying because i know i do not have those things. and it means waking up distraught because it was all just a dream. i want to sleep forever. i want the afterlife to just be one big dream where i can have the happiness i want but without worrying about waking up. everyday that passes i want to just wake up the next day and have everything be back to how it was 3 weeks ago and maybe have that be a bad dream instead. sleep is not even an escape for me anymore because its so temporary. my happiness is always temporary, alseep or awake. the only solace i get is when i am asleep and even then it is a hassle.",6
"high blood pressure spike does anyone else have high blood pressure? i can never tell if my high blood pressure causes my anxiety attacks or the other way around. i guess it s not possible to know. i just ate fast food for the first time in a while, which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. my heart rate was up as if i was on a brisk walk for an hour, despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. it was probably just all of the excess sodium but i just couldn t calm myself back down for anything. i know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon i just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen. doing fine now, just thought i d share in case anyone has a similar thing. this too shall pass",0
"i recently scheduled myself to so stuff i will enjoy doing for tomorrow, however it always gets pushed for tomorrow's tomorrow and then that day's tomorrow and so on.how do i... not do that? tomorrow is magical not in a good way",2
work is dragging pretty tired only got about and a half hour sleep,3
hate the fact that i m damn near forced to figure everything out by myself but it must be done,6
"i am orchestrating how it will work out currently. i will update again after maybe 2 hours or so. unsure if i should do it here or on my profile or somewhere else. hopefully it will come along nicely. i hope.disclaimer if i somehow stopped updating, i was probably robbed ran out of batteries fuck it homiez, i will chronicle the last 24 hours or less of my life starting now",6

"scrolling through this feed, i am apart of the suicidal thoughts as well, but the few times i can separate myself from them and think outside i just see the tortures the mind can do. regrets, challenges, pain, suffering, all becomes heightened more than any happiness. trying to obtain happiness in these states of mind seems so useless. the brain can be a hard thing to manage. sometimes i look at my cat or other non human living beings and just think of what a lovely existence not having to think too much must be ironic that our mind being the most intelligent also makes it the most cruel.",6
grip weakness does anyone else experience weak grip strength right when you wake up in the morning? if so any idea what causes it?,0
captainseebass sparkyma girlfriend trouble got some serious thinking to do,3
but i have not showered in like a week and i know if i get up from the sofa i am going to do something stupid so i am just stuck in this stupid fucking limbo with my cat asleep on my legs like she is keeping me herewhen will i stop feeling like this guy i like is coming over because big sad,2
"i cannot get relationships down. it always seems to end the same way. i give and give and do everything right in the relationship. then it turns out the guy is cheating and using me. i know i am not some supermodel looking woman, i still think i am pretty. well i did, not anymore. i tried working around the cheating, by offering open relationships. they always turn that down though. so what is wrong with me, that i am not good enough? just feeling really low after another one cheated. 1 year relationship down the drain. at this rate i will never marry, or have a family of my own. i feel like such a failure and fool",2
"i am almost 8 months sober and i am falling apart. a shit ton of different traumas all bubbled to the surface around two weeks ago. the people i live with, my support system are on vacation for five weeks. they have not kept in contact with me much. i also have a nasty, painful tooth infection, which is triggering my health-based ocd. i am existing like a zombie. i can barely move right now. when i walk i move in slow motion. i feel like if someone tried to talk to me i would just stare at them because i do not have the energy to open my mouth. i do not know what is happening to me. all i know is that i am thinking about killing myself 24 7. i want to do it. but i am a picky piece of shit and there is only one way i want to go out, and that is by oding on my doc. and i cannot because i have no money. i think that is the only thing stopping me right now. my life is too messy to untangle. i am fucked financially, long-term. i have too much trauma. i do not feel close to anyone. i cannot accomplish anything. i am in so much physical pain. i am not smart. i feel too much. i am overwhelmed with grief from someone i lost to an od over a year ago.i am hanging on by a thread, and its about to snap. please someone help me. please. please someone i need help. please",6
"i hope i am not going to get blasted for this but i have noticed this reddit very often tumbles into one big pity party. i could tell you my life story, but its for another day. i just wanted to say that life is a beautiful thing and i hate some people are missing it. from my own experience, pain is part of life. suffering is optional. a lot starts with forgiveness. of ourselves first and then others. in the end, we will never live while we are trying to die. we have got nothing more to lose sometimes so we grab life again and again and we do our best. we cannot worry about the rest. somebody out there needs you. that was something its taken 40 years to understand. seize the day. we do not know what we have got till its gone. in the end",6

"seeking advice on a close friend who is having her first episodes. i've got a very close family friend who seems to be experiencing her first experiences with bipolar. her mother was diagnosed bipolar. my friend has had what clearly seem to be manic episodes with full-on hallucinations as well as very depressive episodes. she believes that her hallucinations are her having a spiritual experience. even when she is depressed, she thinks she is being punished for her behavior. she thinks the truth of the world is being revealed to her. amp we've been talking to her family and they are afraid to take her to the hospital against her will. the problem is that she is convinced that she is right and everyone is conspiring against her to label her as sick and that they just want to give her drugs to kill her. amp what are the other options available to her and her family? are psychiatrists available for in-home care or diagnosis? how can she get help when she refuses to believe that she has a problem? i'm scared for her safety because her depression gets extremely severe. she thinks that a mass shooting happed because she went out to a club one night. she thinks her small behaviors put peoples lives at risk. she hasn't admitted to being suicidal but i know that there's a strong link between this condition and suicide attempts and it seems like a bad idea to wait for it to get to that point. amp we tried to wait it out for a while to see if her episodes would let up temporarily enough for her to see that she needs help but she seems to go straight from manic to depressed and back without any break. or, if there is a break it doesn't seem to matter because she thinks everything she's experienced is real and that we can't see the truth. the only time she said she wanted help, she meant help in finding someone who will validate her hallucinations. amp my family and hers aren't sure what to do but she clearly needs help. any suggestions or resources you might have would be greatly appreciated. thanks!",1

"how do you know if you re suicidal? the thought of ending it all has been crossing my mind these past few weeks. but the thought of the pain and suffering i would cause my family my seven year old son and wife is heart breaking. my son tells me that i look sad. my wife tells me that everything is going to be alright and i will get through this, but i feel like i won t get through it and all won t be alright. all i want to do is sleep and watch tv. is become increasingly difficult to get up for work in the morning. i loved my job but i don t enjoy work anymore i m a chef . i m i suicidal or just going through another episode? i felt great a month ago. now i m just blah. i m on 40mg latuda. maybe i need my dosage increased? help? i m confused!",1

i turn 25 in 2 weeks. i wish i could say i lived a good life. it was not a good life. i am not a good person. id give anything to start over but i cannot. i am just a privileged brat who thinks i have a sob story. i think it is time for me to stop wasting oxygen. i was so fucking stupid to think this feeling would never come back. i think this is it.,6
"can abandoned old syringe needles give you hivs? age 16 sex male height 5'4 weight 100 lbs race american duration of complaint 1 day recently, was doing a small club cleanup and we've found like 6-7 syringe needles some covered w blood during our beach cleanup. however, i didn't touch them with my paper gloves at all but i've used sticks to find them. i'm starting to feel a little paranoid insecure that even though i didn't touch them at all, the club decided to keep going at it and we were still picking up sticks and cleaning the rocky side of the island. and i was wearing slippers during that cleanup and didn't get to wash my hands right away. can abandoned old syringe needles give you hivs? and is it only possible when injected? i also probably should get blood tested if only i can convince my parents they don't usually believe my suspicious concerns to schedule an appointment",0

"atypical antipsychotic induced mania? or akathysia? so my pdoc increased my solian dose amisulpride . when i started it at 100mg, it threw me into a hell of akathysia. unbearable, wouldn't go there again. it was one of the most horrible things i've experienced with meds, alongside being knocked out with seroquel. now it's at 200mg and 2 days after starting it, i felt my blood running through my veins, couldn't stop moving and pacing and wanted to cry. i slept, hardly, waking up a lot during the night. and when i woke up, it started again. though this time i didn't want to cry. i took my train to go to school, started singing at loud, pacing and having a big smile on my face. i'm now trying to work, since i have exams coming in less than a week and one homework to give on friday. but i just can't concentrate. i keep focusing on everything else like that girl who doesn't give a shit about me but she's so beautiful, i'm pretty sure i could get her. or my friend's birthday which is important or the friends i just should go see today, tomorrow or this weekend. amp i don't know what's going on. i haven't felt like this for months. amp ps you knew me under the username aneaunymousse which, to explain, is just how we'd say anonymous with a very bad english accent in french . i decided not to hide and go out with my new real username.",1
"just got rejected across the board at law schools. my undergrad gpa is abysmal, close to 2.0, but counselors feel the need to be ""positive"" and encouraged me anyway. i expected the rejection but it still feels like a door closed and i think i must have been a bit deluded to apply at all.i have no job. the only job experience i have is in retail and some other minor stuff, and no matter how nicely i dress up my resume, applying to jobs feels extremely futile. i have gotten some initial interviews in recent years but nothing else.i do not have friendships. i do not see people often. some ""friends"" i know, we have occasional shallow interactions and i do not feel any true connection and bond. i also feel less and less able to relate to them as they move forward in life while i stay stuck.my family is not close or overly loving and have been abusive in the past.it is just getting harder and harder to pretend it will get better. i know i can do well academically when my mental issues are not crippling me but at this point to make it into some sort of further education, do well there and find work seems like an almost impossible slog that will take me my entire 30s at best, at worst a risky gamble that might not result in work anyway. like, is that doable? spending your 30s like an adolescent, trying to start your life, with no real income?i lack a sense of worth, a sense of greater purpose, connection and love to others. i mostly just feel grief, loss and disillusionment. i have been at the margins for so long, trying to hold on, trying to find meaning and hope, but it is getting harder. turning 31 this year and feeling hope dwindling in every aspect of my life",6

hello guys i just woke up,3
"need some help, was doing so good too. hey guys! i was doing so good, it had been weeks that i had finally got over my ha for the most part. however, today, i went down the anxiety spiral again. i was itching my back and decided to look at my moles since they seemed to be itchy. nothing too crazy just a few itches. i've read about melanoma before and kind of disregarded it because although i have a good 60 moles none of them showed signs of melanoma. recently i have been getting some new moles, which isn't that crazy in itself but there seemed to be a lot more popping up. so anyway i unfortunately got on the google and did some research on different types of melanoma and what to look for than preceded to check myself. i noticed two somewhat suspect moles. one is slight red brown and the other one appears to be a kinda line. i read that linear melanoma are of the types and it looks a little similar. i'm freaking out because i don't have health insurance, and don't think i can pay for a dermatologist out of pocket since i'm somewhat young and on a fixed income. any advice on how i can handle this or anything i can do to ease my anxieties?",0

"i have never had an evaluation or anything since i was 5 or 6 but i am interested in talking with someone to solve some inner issues. as of friday i no longer have a career got booted, weird long story and finally have some free time to work on myself. i have never been without a job and always worked nonstop so i have never worked on myself. just need to know what to look for in my insurance to start this. how would i know if my insurance covers therapy?",2
"i have tried so hard to do better and to get better. in the past year i have gone on meds, gone to therapy, ended relationships that were not good for me, met new people and made new relationships, worked and become self-reliant, done well in college and made new goals for myself. all to end up alone, unemployed, possibly homeless soon, and unsure of just what the fuck i am living for. all i really know right now is that i get happiness and a sense of purpose from helping and taking care of others, but those i try to do that with just end up needing space as soon as my mental state gets too bad for me to be able to do that anymore. instead i just get told that i am too much to deal with but you can do it and do not be afraid to ask others for help!! its so hard to see a reason to continue when despite trying to improve my life it just ends up getting worse. just posting here since i have no one to go to",6
"lately i have not been myself, some days i eat a lot some days i eat nothing, ever since about a week ago l have been waking up sitting on my couch and doing nothing with my day. i am 15 and its been hard lately, i used to be super active going swimming every day and working out. now i am just not doing anything and this is a bad way to put it but sometimes i feel dead inside or i feel as if i am not doing anything with my life. i am not experiencing any emotions either. is this depression? if not what is it? how do i know if i am depressed?",2

"so bit of background first, i am in my early 20s and diagnosed depression and anxiety disorder, i have been taking 40mg citalopram for the past 7 months. before that i would been upped from 10mg - 20mg then 30mg-40mg 3 months prior to being on 40mg long term.i do not know where to begin honestly as there is alot i could talk about , i could go on for a while. so i just have one question really. also kind of a vent but i will try and keep with it.so on and off since i was around 13 14 i have always fantasized my own death, like it was never a common occurrence in my mind but when it did prop up it would stuck for a while usually from around to 1-2 weeks . at this time i would just think about if i did die, how people would react to it and if it would be worth it.this faded around 16 after i tried to take my own life and had only just started to get help as i had a myriad of things going on in my mind i just could not understand and it frustrated me. as soon as i started college a few months later i had dropped all the help i had been given and then just started to crumble and took to drinking and using drugs.when i inevitably left college after quiting my 2nd year towards the end due to an incident, my mental health went on a huge decline.everyday i just feel like i am all out of energy, like my own body has given up. i think about past events constantly, wishing i could change them. how things could have been if i did not make one simple choice here and there. just constant regret playing on a loop in my mind and it is just tormenting. this lead to me thinking about myself dying alot more than i have in the past. in the past 6 months alone it is just been constant, it burdens my mind daily no matter what i do. i cannot find joy in anything at the moment or even stick to a single thing and keep myself motivated as my mind always slips into grim thoughts no matter what.the enjoyment has been stripped from my life, right now it just feels like i am completely lost and idk what to do anymore. the days roll on without me even noticing anymore as i just cannot focus properly.i am getting professional help but i just feel like it is not working anymore, they just speak to me and it is just words that mean nothing really. i have kept to my medication and have tried to follow advice but all motivation is gone.i feel so lost rn, i have no direction. no goal, no motive. no anything really, i do not have a life as its just thoughts and nothing else. idk what i am asking. is it normal? is there any advice you could give? how do i break the cycle of thoughts and just let myself be me, it is getting really hard to like keep having to deal with it day in and day out question?",2

"btw sorry i am french canadian i cannot spell was diagnosed at 15 took meds for 6 months.i have seen a therapist in those 6 months . i feel so empty that i sometimes wonder how could i be even close to the hapiness i had before the depression. me and my dad fought a lot verbally . one time we were fighting over me not telling him what i was telling my therapist and he fucking stormed out the house after telling me he was going to jump over a fucking bridge. i was alone in the house while he was on his walk i guess. called my mom in shock , vomited in the toilet a lot and destroyed the phone on the ground while on the phone with my mom. stopped the meds, smoked weed like everyday not drinking everyday. now i am 24. its been 9 years and tonight i am just getting close to my lowest.i cannot quite figure out what is wrong with me.i wonder if that shit fucfked me up emotionnally but my past relationships ends with me not beeing able to fucking let go.... now that is off my chest i do feel a little better. need to put my emotions in words",2

"i do not know how to be an adult, i do not know how to be a normal person. i have been planning to move out of my moms house for college for about a year now, and three days ago i finally did. nothing seems to be going that well. i do not have a place to live and i do not have a job. the passenger side of my car is damaged, idk how it even happened. if someone hit it or i hit it and did not notice. shit like this makes me feel so helpless and every time anything bad happens my first instinct is to kill myself it sounds so much better than any of this. i do not want to have to deal with anything. and i feel feel selfish. why do i get special treatment? why do i get an easy out when everyone else has to deal with the weight of living? i do not want to work and i do not want to go to fucking college. i do not care if i sound like a freeloader. i do not understand how i can possibly live with all of my thoughts and all of my mental problems and still be expected to do things in order to survive. i just do not understand. all i want to do is focus on things i love. i want to do nothing but watch anime and listen to music and masterbate and practice drawing. i have a lot of passion, and i hate myself and i know i am not that good at anything but if i was just able to focus on making myself feel better and discovering what i love then id be okay. god i just need more time, i need a year or two to find myself. but i cannot just leave and go back home, not without an excuse. my mom is a paranoid drug addict and my dad is an alcoholic, and they would be disappointed in me. at least my dad would and i do not know why it matters but it does. my friend is counting on me because we were supposed to do all this college shit together, and if i leave now then all of our plans are down the drain. if i tried to kill myself two things would happen 1 it would work, and that is that. everything will be over, i will not have to worry anymore. 2 it would not work. and id then be the fucking idiot who tried to kill herself the third day of living on her own and had to go back and live with her mom. i am fine with either one really. if i do not die i am going to be so fucking depressed but at least ill be back home and then i cannot do my favorite thing be mindless and numb to my own life, wrap myself in the simple things i enjoy too much. at least i can see what happens in jujutsu kaisen lmao. but in case i do die there are some things i want to do, and its so stupid really. i want to see black widow and finish attack on titan. i want to read some fanfic for a manhwa i just finished. maybe get jack in the box too lollll. there is so much music that i have wanted to listen to though. i hope in the next life ill be able to do all the things i was not able to in this one. not sure. if i do not decide tonight then tomorrow maybe. all i do is because problems for myself and burden other people things are too overwhelming, i cannot handle anything",6

its just so funny how everything that comes my way i just spoil i just cannot take it anymore i do not want to spend the rest of my life picking up pieces of myself i have set the date 9 21 i will kill myself i chose that date not sooner because that is when i come back from boston after visiting my niece and nephew i just want to see them one last time. i ruin everything good for me,2

i don t understand i read it would be lethal to take this much at once but i feel perfectly fine i know i m just going to get a bunch of people telling me to go to a hospital but what s up with this shouldn t i be dead,2
i just cannot i am tired i know very well the rules to this game now and me typing this shit is just a part of it i will type some shit that i am sad and i want to kill myself maybe if i feel really bad i will type that i am about to kill myself by jumping from a high bridge but it will not happen because either i will forget that i ever typed this or that i am getting a small turning point of happiness or motivation that will make me consider my suicide and then later shortly fail me and make feel shitty agian or i will just bang out. what i am trying to say what if you have become well aware of a pattern in your life that your bound to that you have tried to change but with no success? is it really worth to keep living because i feel like screaming and go crazy by now. at this point i am horrible to ask people this but i need someone to say that i should kill myself to agree that this is not worth it. now we should be real i am incredible selfish to ask this but i neeed this cmon say i am doing a positive thing smth bruv what should you do if your been depresst for 4 years,6

"am i forever going to be haunted by my ex-friend? tw rape, sexual assault i'm 23 and an ex-friend of mine is 24. three years ago i cut off our friendship. it was the closest relationship i've ever had, and i've never felt more connected to a person since. i think about him everyday. 3 years ago my sister, who we'll call s accused him of raping her. but she didn't even. i had to confront her about it. according to my ex-friend, who we'll call f, they got really really drunk one night, and ended up having sex. one week or so after it happened f told me first. he said that s thought it was his imagination until he saw s had blocked him on every social media and he wasn't sure what happened. he thinks maybe she's guilty because s had a boyfriend at the time. he tells me to ask her what happened. i say, ""maybe she thinks it was non-consensual, since you were both inebriated?"" he says, ""that's possible"" he tells me she was asleep, he was in bed with her drinking and getting high she had invited him into bed with her-she told me she felt he was a little brother and could trust him . he was drinking all night as she slept. when she woke up, they were both black out drunk. he doesn't remember who kissed who first, but that she ""initiated grinding"" and that something happened after that... it makes me sick thinking about it. after that night, he tells me my mother messaged him saying, ""never step foot into this house again. but op needs you as a friend. so let's just promise to keep this between us."" he wasn't sure what that meant but was afraid of the worst. context matters. s was 30 years old. f was 20. she's a decently heavy drinker by no means an alcoholic, but she can hold her liquor . he's literally autistic. does it sound like an imbalance? maybe more context matters. the people who checked in on them noticed that he was decently lucid last time they were seen together, while she was asleep, high and drunk. passed out? blacked out? he claims he was in the process of getting drunk as she slept. even more context. my family has a shaky moral foundation. they lie to get money, to get their way. they've made me do it even if i didn't want to. they don't care about anyone else except the family. but they'll even mess with family if it comes to it. my sister and mom planned to keep it from me. like i said, my mom thought i needed f so much that she was willing to keep it a family secret. and i keep thinking... if f was a monster, if f had such shaky grounds, if f cared about power, he would have played along with it. i know that monster's don't rape. people rape. but people also look out for themselves when they know they've fucked up. people are selfish. f didn't seem selfish to me. a self-aware rapist would have kept his mouth shut, right? why didn't he accept my mother's conditions and kept the family secret? he told me my friendship with him was his greatest source of happiness. he would've done anything to preserve it. why didn't he? and my family knew this friend meant so much to me that they were willing to keep my sister's rape a secret for my sake? if f was a monster, he would have taken the deal? but monster's don't rape. people do. f told me everything. he agreed that i should talk to s and get her side of the story. because he wasn't sure if he had raped her either. he didn't know. or was his game to play dumb? s told me that she only remembers flashes. ""he raped me"" she said after i asked. she starts crying. she says she woke up with bruised wrists. she woke up sore. she didn't look like she was lying. i don't think she was lying. and for three years i've been haunted by the idea. what if truly, he didn't think he had raped her? not in the way idiot monstrous men believe that drunk women can consent. me and f took consent extremely seriously. but what if truly they were both extremely drunk, and they lost control of their both their bodies, and that nothing could have possibly made sense except for an ugly truth? if there were a reality, where my friend was truly too drunk to rape someone and too drunk to give consent himself, but somehow ended up having sex with someone equally too drunk to not give consent, then what would that reality look like? because everyday i wake up and think, that reality looks frighteningly close to this one.",4

"i am someone who has struggled with low self esteem, perfectionism and passiveness all my life. but i always put it away, finding escapism on the internet or things like a fandom. not thinking about those insecurities, not thinking about myself. only thinking about how things might be better in the future, but not thinking about me in the present moment. i am good at putting on a smile and feeling fine for a moment and sometimes i can feel good when being more active , but somehow i think i not only tricked others but sometimes also myself. but honestly are you really okay when you are spending hours and hours doing nothing a day? not doing anything? and just hating yourself both outside and inside? just somewhat existing but that is it. i have only had two therapy sessions so far to cope with my negative self-image and compulsive tendencies , and it is like finally it clicked with me how unhappy and lost i am. no you are not ""fine"" just because you are not suicidal. it is hard but i think i am getting to a point where i am realising that i am fucking insecure and that my life is empty. maybe realising this will be a turning point.every summer i feel incredibly lonely. while everyone is off having fun, i basically let two months pass by like it is nothing. i work, but other time is spent scrolling on the internet. jealousy of others having fun comes over me, but i know ultimately it is down to me never asking my friends to do something, i think because i am afraid they really do not want to spend time with me in the end. i can be social and outgoing when i am in class, but once i come home i feel empty and i spend the rest of my day on my own in my own head. lately i have really come to terms with the fact that yes, i fucking struggle mentally. it is like every summer i realise that yes, i do feel fucking lonely. i have friendships but they are superficial and i never really know how to voice my insecurities and thoughts with them. i miss meaningful friendships in my real life. i have lost friendships and it is totally due to my own lack of assertiveness. it is not that i did something wrong, but i just did ""nothing"". i do really hate myself for certain decisions i have made and not putting more effort in my life, but i also do not know where to start.it is like finally i am realising for myself that i am lost, i do not have it all together and i do not have to pretend i do because i cannot keep fooling myself. i am disappointed with myself and i am not really coping with how unsatisfied i am with my life. and it frustrates me to no end that i see people being busy and happy but that i feel constantly as i am missing that one thing that can make me like these people. i want to change so bad and be better, live normally. but i do not know how. it sounds weird, but i am done pretending to be fine and accept my depressive feelings to work on them .",2

so i ve been browsing this sub for a while don t have much to do today so i figured i might a well vent on here i guess to introduce myself i m currently and just recently left the active duty army to attend college on an rotc scholarship about month ago prior to that i wa deployed to afghanistan for about 0 month it s almost hard to even recall the person i used to be back then i wa so mentally strong and confident in myself and my purpose ironically despite working hour day seven day a week under constant threat of getting blown up i can t remember a time when i wa better off mentally like nothing in the world could stop me a i had a plan and wa going to stick with it and if i did end up getting murked i wa just fine with that too i stayed pretty safe for the most part although i did have a pretty close call with a rocket that landed in a ditch on the hill below the building i worked in it obviously scared the ever living fuck out of me and everyone else but after like 0 minute we were all laughing about how close that one wa and how if only the stupid guy had aimed higher he would have got u the whole affair really only strengthened my resolve and made the return home that much better getting back to the state wa probably the best moment of my life even if it wa right in the middle of covid lol i don t want to sound like i m trying to flex my great strength or anything i m just trying to describe who i wa then to who am i now a they aren t even remotely the same person problem started to arise for me around month after getting back after the novelty of being back home wore off i started to experience this weird sense of dissociation and depressive episode that would sometimes last for an hour to a day and then i would suddenly snap back to what i considered a normal state of mind these normally entailed feeling of hopelessness and dread like something in my head just wasn t ticking right and when it came to social situation it wa like i wa operating on a different frequency than everyone else like i could hear and understand them but there wa no emotion behind the word it wa distracting but manageable at that point and i just chalked it up to being burned out at work and figured once i got off active duty and into college thing would greatly improve fast forward to the first semester of college and unfortunately thing have not gone a i imagined in term of school and finance i m doing fine and everything is going according to plan externally but internally i seem to be slowly degrading bit by bit the depressive episode became more intense to the point where i would physically lock up tighten my muscle grind my teeth and it feel like my head is throbbing from all the negative thought it is nearly impossible to sleep in this state thanks to the extreme anxiety but then i would wake up the next morning and feel fine barely being able to remember how i felt the night before the cycle never stopped though and then the thought of well if you just ended it this wouldn t be a problem anymore started to kick in and that s when it really started to snowball downhill fast at this point in time it feel like i m in this depressive state nearly all the time it s only a matter of how bad it s going to be today the dissociative feeling have been cranked up to and conversation just feel like emotionless formality i can no longer connect with friend and family the way i used to like i said earlier it s like we re not on the same frequency if that make any sense the thought of suicide are ever present and feel like a big red emergency eject button begging to be pressed the only escape from these feeling are partying drug and alcohol which are great temporarily but eventually everyone go back to their life you sober up and reality slap you in the face even harder than it did last time i ve also developed a very odd fear of human intimacy that i really can t explain for instance i m a virgin which is a huge insecurity of mine and pretty embarrassing i know i always figured when i m in college i ll meet plenty of woman so there s no need to be insecure about it however i ve had several instance where woman have come onto me and i m totally comfortable with the conversation and flirty talk but once it get physical even just them grabbing me it trigger this instant fear and panic response and i make up an excuse and leave in a manic state then beat myself up for the next week about how much of a pussy i am this is honestly one of the major contributor to my broken self image a couple of week ago i randomly started bawling in my car for over an hour and honestly don t even remember why i m not eating much anymore maybe only like one meal a day and my cognitive performance motivation ha declined significantly my sleep schedule is a total mess i ll either sleep for hour and wake up from nightmare in cold sweat or sleep for and not want to get out of bed and face reality what really prompted me to post this though wa that last week i got really drunk and ended up putting a gun to my head without even thinking about it and then i realized what i wa doing that s when i kind of told myself holy shit man this is real and something is very wrong with you i need some kind of help i know but if i m diagnosed with any kind of mental health condition i ll lose my scholarship and i ve just worked too damn hard for it i ve openly told some of my close friend and family directly that i m having suicidal thought but the response is always oh c mon man your way too strong for that or you re just in a slump right now it ll pas a much a i appreciate having people who care for me and appreciate the sentiment it doesn t do much to alleviate anything i feel like i wa never meant to live this long and that that rocket wa supposed to kill me that day but i m living in some kind of an alternate reality where i survived and nothing make sense anymore at least then i could have died strong and confident rather than broken i had a friend who wa killed over there and honestly i wish i could trade place with him he deserves this life more than i do sorry i turned this into an essay but it feel good to get this out of my head for once if you read this long i hope you can relate or at least get something out of it and thank you finally i ll leave you with a song i ve been listening to on repeat for the past week lmao

"this is a long read but it is needed for context.also tw - sexual assult 18m - for the past 5 years i have struggled with my mood badly because of bullying and anxiety related to past trauma and stuff. in the past it has mainly been a reason out of my control as to why i have felt so crap. but since early last year it is been my own fault.i was in a fairly serious relationship with a girl. of course, us being teenagers we were quite sexually active. however, i grew to almost expect the sex and in the end, one night it resulted in me misreading the situation completly and i sexually assaulted my girlfriend of the time. the person i cared about most and loved.most people will probably read this as black and white and immediately judge me, as many of the people around me have. ever since a rumour started going round at school i started losing some of my closest friends. friends some of whom i had been close with since childhood. i do not blame them, these days there is a lot of pressure of not to be friends with someone who commited such a vile act.the problem i have had with myself is that, days after the incident happened and i was told through a mutual friend between my then girlfriend and i how she felt, i immediately went and called my girlfriend. since the pandemic had just begun so we could not see eachother face to face . on this call, i had the sudden realisation of what i had done and the seriousness of what i had done hit me all at once, resulting in me, someone already prone to anxiety, to have a full on panic attack where i voiced the worst case scenario that was in my head of ""holy shit what i did was fucking illegal and i could go to jail. i could go to jail and my life would be over.""of course, i was not thinking rationally at all and i was not thinking about the impact of my actions and how i should have tried to apologize properly or something different. the conversation we had did not achieve anything except do both of us harm. we would continue to date well into the summer until we ended it. from that day on i felt some guilt, to the point where i did not really fully quite trust myself and i was treading extremely lightly wherever i went. i did not feel the confidence to start another relationship at all and i was contempt with it feeling that perhaps a break is what i needed.come the spring of this year. in the uk there is been a huge surge in awareness about sexual violence and stuff due to the sarah everard kidnapping, rape and murder. a new ""testimonial"" site called ""everyone is invited"" gains a lot of traction on social media. me being someone who usually sees themselves as an advocate for social issues and change and stuff, i decide to one day have a look at the website after a couple days. i am scrolling through reading all these horrible situations people have experienced thinking to myself, ""god this is so disgusting i cannot believe-"" and then i come across a story that sounds all too familiar. i knew immediately it was about me. i read the testimony in full, and then, did not know what to do with myself. not only did i now feel ""exposed"" but new information had come to light to me regarding how my ex felt about the entire ordeal, including my tearful panic attack call. in the testimony it said she felt that i was only thinking about myself on the call, that i was selfish and had completely disregarded her completely in that conversation. naturally i broke down into tears and could not sleep a wink that night with a million thoughts in my head about what i did, how terrible a person i was, i am a criminal and how i do not deserve to live anymore. it took 2 days for people in school to work out that the ""anonymous"" testimony had been written by my ex and how i was the disgusting perpetrator described in it. and from then on it has been a constant downwards spiral for the last 5 months. i have not been able to look in the mirror without thinking ""what a disgusting monster you are you do not deserve to breathe"" or whatever. you know, self hate. i have completely lost confidence socially since i lost all of my friends so i am second guessing every single person i meet even the bloody barista at a cafe thinking ""they know they know they know"". i cannot trust myself sexually at all. any time i have an urge i get an overwhelming sense of guilt resulting in anxiety afterwards about ""i will never be normal and be able to enjoy anything again"". and then of course due to the nature of what i did i get the thought ""you deserve to feel like this, if you do not feel like this then you are not sorry and you are not forgivable"". i brought this upon myself so this time i deserve this depression. i do not know what to do with myself and i honestly believe that i deserve to die. and that is it. i have never felt this close to being able to kill myself before but... this time it really does feel like the right and only option.but hey... thanks for reading my essay of my life right now... i just wanted somewhere to feel like i am being listened to since i have felt like i have not had a voice at all these last 5 months...tl dr i made the biggest fuckup of my life and the guilt that has arisen from the peer pressure and myself has made my already pretty bad depression even worse. this time i brought it upon myself.",2

"general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantthe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. i mean of course they would care. people even care when strangers die. the initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. but i think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. the only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.but the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that i know i cannot be. i want to make something of myself but i just, i cannot. i have nothing to put on my resume, i cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that i just do not! and nobody thinks to tell me because i should already know! why do not i already know basic crap! why did i spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! why cannot i take care of myself without burning out? if i brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then i am burnt out! that is it! i cannot do anything else for the day, i am too tired! there is no way i could work or get a job like this! i would burn out after one task and get fired! i hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how i am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that i am the best. i hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs i do not get approval because i am literally shit at everything so i am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. i hate that i even told anyone that i am a narc. of course they would not accept me!! what the hell was i thinking!! what kind of idiot would expect anything different!! things are not going to get better for the npd community, not in my life time atleast! well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their npd recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something i could not. maybe. when i am in my 80s. and my mom, my poor mom. she has to pay for everything because i cannot do shit on my own. physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, i hate this!! you should not have to take care of me!! you should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! you should be doing your hobbies and i should be the one buying you things!! maybe i will get to the point of recovery where i am not so self-centered, and then i can finally let go. and they can all finally live their lives. i wish i was not such a narc so i could just find peace in death",6

whenever i look up people talking about there depression they always say how they hate themselves and all that but for me that is not the case. i am content with the person i am and i have learned to love myself. the problem i have is that nearly every human i have met has put on this barrier between me and them no matter how much effort i put into the relationship it is never what i want. i just want to find someone who has or is going through the same things i am going through. i hate life but not myself.,2
just spent the last half hour making a playlist for tonight it s going to be a long night,3
i have lots of people in mylife that love and care about me but i still feel empty and alone every day i wake up. i feel hopeless and lost. i feel afraid and trapped in my mind. i dread waking up everyday and i wish something out of my control would just kill me already. i hate being alive and i am miserable everyday i live. i want to live and see the world because it has so much to offer but not like this. i feel guilty for wanting to die because there are other people that want to live but cannot. i hope my family will one day understand why i did it and will hopefully forgive me because they will acknowledge the pain i was going through. feeling very alone right now,2
"the most updated news info is really the most exciting, this is the platform from the camera logo",3
"i was about 14, 30 now when i was first diagnosed with depression and put on anti-depressants. i used to do this thing where i would come home from school every day and cry from the moment i walked in the door until i fell asleep at night. i would literally go about my entire day, dinner, homework, whatever, crying. obviously, that is not normal, and i really internalized that it was not. but my life at the time was also not normal. i had a very abusive childhood and my emotional responses were all normal of a kid in my situation. and now when i think about all that it just makes me fucking angry that my family's reaction to all of that was to put me on anti-depressants when it was pretty clear what i was depressed about. there was not anything wrong with me or my brain. the problem was my situation. for 15 years it is been the same story. try this drug, try that drug, go to this therapist and that therapist and rehash the same shit over and over and over again. nothing really works, because really, very little has changed other than the medications and therapist. i still have a hard time being with family, and i hate feeling completely trapped in the state and country i live in. now that i have finally got a job that pays well enough for me to take a step back and see what i want, i realize that what i want is to not spend 40 hours a week for the rest of my life working. it is a total scam. and i think it is the real reason a lot of people are depressed. it is a depressing system we live in so much so that they have to drug us to keep us from killing ourselves. after all, who is going to do the work if we all just off ourselves? i have been on more anti-depressants than i can count and i truly believe it emotionally stunted me. your emotions are supposed to be like an ocean. mostly calm, but sometimes there are waves. for me, if i was not on something, they were always a total tsunami. i really think this is because i was on anti-depressants at such an early age when it was important for me to be learning how to deal with those on my own. i did not and it really fucked me over as an adult. recently i was put on abilify, which seemed fine until i lost the ability to laugh at or enjoy anything. normally i would describe myself as a very passionate person, but that is all gone. i stopped taking it two months ago. i still cannot really hold long conversations. i do not really give a shit about anything. i guess my point to all of this, is that i think a lot of us who are depressed actually have fairly good reason to be. i do not think it is just some disease that is just happened to become common in humans recently. it is a result of how we are living our lives and what we are able to do. i have always internalized my depression as something that was just my fault, but i think it is really just a result of not being in control of the world around me and not really being able to do anything about all the problems in it. we were never supposed to have 24 7 news about every fucked up thing that happens in the world blasted at us constantly. i hate going to the store and knowing that merchandise could literally be called ""not made by slaves"" but it would totally be made by slaves. our systems make it nearly impossible to live ethically, and that is too fucking depressing for medications to fix. i have no solution for this, i just think maybe sometimes depression is actually a justified response to fucked up world. not advocating for not taking meds, obviously there are people who need them. i am starting to think there is not really anything wrong with me..",2

"hey guys. i have used this subreddit before to say how i really feel about myself and my life. even if only one person reacts, i have found it very therapeutic. i am also a musician and try to convey some of the depression and hopelessness i have felt forever. throughout my major depressive episodes, i have written and produced music that i can now look back on and see where i was. some of my favorite albums are bleak or dystopian or just generally influenced by depression. the best examples of this for me include the album deathconsciousness by the band have a nice life, and songs about leaving by clarissas weird. does anybody else have a go-to soundtrack or film they put on when they want to disintegrate? sometimes, our only hope is relating to life through art. shout out to anyone still with us reading this. coping with music and art",6

"tl dr- last paragraphat the moment i am going through some extremely difficult times. my physical health has declined very drastically after going through a rather rough time of not being able to find the right medicine. its been two years since i started really feeling the difference from me being really sad and me being depressed. i did not get onto the right combinations of medicines until the end of april this year. i forgot what it was like to have good days, so when the medicine started working it was so amazing. i was so happy. i was improving and fixing so much of what i had lost and i felt better than ever. this did not last and that is why i titled this the way it is. my partner and i have been together for a long time. many years before i was diagnosed with depression. i was the one who looked after her mental health, so when we switched it made some things really difficult. she saved me from myself so many times and i always let everyone know how grateful i was to her. eventually the medicine worked and i was feeling happy for myself and our relationship. however, it took a great toll on her and she kept her feelings from me and made hasty decisions she regrets making. she wanted us to take a break while she could be more independent. i did not get this because i said i would totally support her with everything. hours later she regretted saying what she said. it was hard for me, this has never happened between us before. we eventually started getting back on track even though things were tense. her pet ended up dying and she went to visit family for the weekend, when she came back she said she wanted us to take a break, again. i kind of broke at that point, she kept trying to convince me that she still wanted us to be together, but i just could not understand. so i said okay, but i told her that i do not think i could just take a break. she sat on this for a couple hours and regretted it again. it was much much harder for me to come back this time. and now i am the one struggling with how i feel about her. i love her deeply but these wounds are so large and i do not know if ill be able to have them fixed. we are trying but its going to take a long time. this also worries me and hurts my trust in her. i have also lost a connection to a group of close friends during this time. we go to different universities and i have not know them as long as they had known each other. the other friend that is long distance like me, is the one i am closest to. when my medicine started working, i told him that i was worried about this very thing happening and then it did. i feel alone and apart from everyone in my life and its horrible. i dislike pity. mostly just from those close to me and care for me deeply but just do not get what i am going through. my grandmother is the closest person to me in my whole life and i rely heavily on her input. telling her how bad my physical health has become killed me. hearing her cry because she is so scared for me is too much and it makes me feel so horrible. back to the title, there is a difference in this depression on this medicine and what i was on before. i am lucid and capable of rational thought and it can feel so much worse than when i could not process everything. i am looking for the answers to help me now, and never finding them makes everything so much worse. the different emotions i feel get thought about and it makes me so mad that i cannot do anything about it. i am at the point where i may stop taking my medicine to make things easier for me, i just do not want to regret this later. i am worried and hurt. sometimes i feel worse when i am on my medicine",2

"i do not know what to do anymore. i know there are some people in my life who care about me but it does not feel like it... i have been giving up in my mind as i continue floating through life, getting myself into multiple different situations that get me nowhere, causing me more grief. i do not know why i am always looking for attention and love but i am. i just feel so empty without someone to constantly praise me and make me feel cared for. i feel like everyone has abandoned me emotionally. i am having such a hard time moving forward as an adult... finding a job, being successful, etc... i just do not have it in me right now. i need to be held and babied and told everything is going to be okay. i do not feel like a 22 year old woman... i feel like a scared little girl who needs to be protected and guided. i am so sick and tired of trying my best even though i do not know what the hell i am doing, and just being judged and criticized and told it is not enough. i am so heartbroken and lost. i do not want to keep fighting for this sad life anymore, i want to give into the dark temptation finally that sits in the back of my mind and drift off into blissful nothingness. i am not enough for anyone, everyone abandons me, i feel so empty and lonely.",6

"for a long time i have just been saying i am absolutely worthless, and i cannot remember the reasoning as to why i am doing this. this has been going on for 10 years. i always find someway to bring myself down for no reason. i disconnect myself from people when they are nice to me, just saying that they are faking it, that i am not worth their time. beating myself up is the only time i truly feel anything anymore. i put others before me and make sure they are happy even if it makes me more depressed. i just want to quit all the time. i also think this way of thinking makes me weak which brings me back to berating myself with insults. why do i do this to myself",2

"long story short i have always overslept , no matter when i get to bed . most of the time its because my half awake brain stops the alarm and its game over from there . even when i wake up from the alarm , i can be 5 minutes late from sitting in bed too long . i do not what else i can change , even if i had a later start time i think the same thing would happen . bc i can literally sleep for 20 hrs . i have had understanding managers and coworkers in the past , but it always comes to the point where their understanding can only go so far . looking for any help to stop this pattern , or to help managers understand i am not irresponsible...just depressed thank you chronic oversleeping due to depression leaves me consistently inconsistent and late to work . advice ? help me advocate for myself ? is it wild to think accommodations could be made?",2
"looking for advice about what to do now that i have no insurance. i really need some guidance and or suggestions. i have no support system and no one to talk this out with to figure out what i should do. amp backstory i lost my job at the beginning of january. that on top of things that i was already dealing with and at the time i was unmedicated i ended up flipping my sh t and ended up in the mental health unit for a week. during that week they got me medicated with lamictal and latuda, stabilized and finally i was discharged with a follow up appointment with a pdoc already scheduled for me. the problem is that my insurance ran out at the end of january. i currently have no job not for a lack of trying, i just bomb the interviews horribly and no way to pay for a doctor's visit and my local resources can't do anything for me for a couple of months due to lack of openings through my county's community services board i don't know what the term is for other places but this is set up to handle mental health stuff for uninsured or under insured people . my awesome therapist decided to keep seeing me even though the insurance is now cancelled, and my primary doctor is going to work with me to get me taken care of as well. my therapist, the pdoc in the hospital, and my primary care doc have all advised me against going back to work right now and are urging me to seek temporary disability benefits as they all feel that i need a year or two to get back to a functioning level and i hated to admit it, but i agree with them because i am completely unable to handle leaving my house most of the time now days. they all told me to go to social services and apply for medicaid so that i can keep going to the doctor which i am working on as well as trying to figure out how to get disability. i have no insurance or money to pay for a pdoc appointment first appointment as a new patient is base priced at 300 and medications the lamictal i can get without insurance for around 15 while the latuda is about 1500. the makers of latuda offer a discount program themselves but it's only up to 600 which still leaves me about 900 to pay out of pocket so that does me no good.in the meantime, i have no idea how to get my medications refilled and i know that i can't just stop taking them. the pdoc in the hospital said the latuda would only be for a month and then he advised that i stop the latuda and go fully on the lamictal 2 times a day. of course that would ultimately be left up to the pdoc i was scheduled to see. should i contact my primary doc and see if she will write the rx as the pdoc said it should be be after the month of latuda was up? is there anything that anyone knows of that will help me get low cost or no cost help? amp thanks in advance. i hate to ask here but i don't know where else to turn at this point and i don't want to annoy my doc or therapist until i have an idea of the direction that i should be going in first. amp amp",1

"19m my life is in order in most people's perspective, i live independently, have my own place, do not struggle for money as i have an okay paying job to cover bills and have money saved up at the same time, go to the gym atleast 3-4 times a week and a pretty good diet. i know that my attitude is to blame but i do not know how to change it. i have no interests or hobbies which of course would be a easy answer but i have tried multiple times and just feel no enjoyment of that it is pointless, growing up i was like this also, constantly starting things and never keeping to it, the gyms the only thing i have ever been consistent at.i have read many self help books and feel as if the knowledge i have learnt from them i am just using to make myself feel worse as i get there are solutions out there and i probably know them myself, almost as if it is like an information paralysis. i am pretty good at giving advice and being empathetic towards others but when it is for myself it is impossible, i have had zero success with women my entire life and scrutinize myself for it 24 7, once again its down to my attitude, i am aware of this. was even beginning to feel slight resentment towards women at one point but soon got a grip of myself and realized i was just projecting my hatred towards myself onto them, i see them as a whole other, and that i am utterly unable to bond with them i mean i am not wrong? 19 years without a single thing is more than enough genuine proof, is there something about my energy or what? how is a change in attitude going to change this life lost issue. i am so so lost, i am becoming more and more suicidal by the day, it was a depression feeling before but now i feel i am being rational and logical in taking that route. i have family, who are ridiculously dissfunctional and could not give me anyway worthwhile help, i have pushed away all my friends after realising i was just a downer and that once i cut myself out of their lives they would be happier, which i was spot on. i have become a recluse, timid and bitter prick towards everything. have no backbone, i feel i have no frame of reference for anything. my mental state is deteriorating more and more by the day, i have gone stupider, my vocabulary has halfed, i am slow, even more boring that before, everything i read these days does not register and even if i it did my overall anxiety stops me from using things i have learnt in the first place as i am just constantly stressing every situation. it is easy to say that i need to be kinder to myself but i disagree, i feel like i am a realist and too much if that, and my views of myself are not negative but utter reality. desperately need to change, becoming more suicidal by the day. open to any advice",2
"i do not know why i am posting this, especially on my main account, whether it is to find comfort with potentially like-minded people, to just throw it out into the anonymous void that is the internet, or just to vent further but i truly feel in my heart if i had a gun or maybe a rope, just some means where i know i would be dead while also not risking the lives of other people like i potentially would be if i jumped off the nearest bridge, i would be gone. my urge is strong, stronger than it is ever been, i feel hopeless and unable to get help, but i have also failed enough in life and the last thing i want to do is fail at ending it too.i used the lifeline chat, and i know some people have had bad experiences with both the hotline and the chat, but i do think the person i got was trying to help as best they could, and maybe i will try to use the resources they presented me with to try and get on the road to recovery, i just do not know what that road even is anymore nor where it might take me.i guess the sticky notes version of my life is grew up in a somewhat dysfunctional family. mom died young, after i graduated, and it messed me up, dad developed dementia and i was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until i finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends. i was in a good position at work i guess but my life is literally my miserable job then nothing else meaningful and i am finding it harder to tough through my mental blocks and have been missing work, dying up my bank account and am close to homeless. i truly do not know nor understand what exactly is wrong with me. no car never learned to actually drive and have to walk everywhere. therapy would cost money but juggling therapy with my job so i could afford it seems impractical in my position. maybe i am just too lazy to make it work? i dunno. i could go on but feel i have rambled long enough.thanks for reading... whatever this is. if i had a gun right now, i would be dead.",6

"breast cancer worries hi everyone, i'm sure this is nothing new but i really needed to get it out. my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer a few months ago and is currently going through chemo. i've had bad health anxiety all my life and my mom's diagnosis has pretty much put me over the edge. my left breast same as the one she found her cancer in felt sore, so of course i squeezed and kneaded the hell out of it trying to feel something. i didn't feel anything other than the fact that it is slightly bigger than the other, which is something i've known for a while but now i'm second guessing myself. the soreness went away with my last period, and then returned this month. again, i squeezed and checked it compulsively. i cannot keep my hands off it. always checking to see if it feels better or worse. my so gently suggested that this isn't helping but i can't seem to stop. now that my period has arrived, it feels much better but there's still one spot that hurts to poke. i've also lost 70lbs in the past couple years so my breasts don't look great for a 26 year old and i think that contributes to my worry. i'm always looking for symmetry to assuage my fears. and now i've developed a rash that i'm pretty sure is from stress. it started on my stomach and is spreading. this prompted me to look up inflammatory breast cancer and i've basically given myself a death sentence. i'm going to the clinic tomorrow to have it checked out but every fibre of my being wants to cancel and just hope it goes away. i'm also going to request a referral for an ultrasound. i'm sorry if this is all over the place. i usually talk to my parents about my fears but obviously i don't want to bring this up. besides the anxiety it's causing, i also feel so horrible and selfish. has anyone else imagined or basically given themselves symptoms after a family member or friend has been diagnosed with an illness? any suggestions on how to function normally? i'm exhausted from the constant adrenaline rushes thank you",0

"recovered, but it's too late i suffered from severe avpd from my late teens into my early twenties. during this time, i cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. in fact, i pretty much became a recluse. i eventually started to recover when i was about 22. i'm now in my late twenties, and though i feel i've overcome most avpd symptoms, i feel like i am too old to make new friends. i've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends, but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. i really feel like i would've made my lifelong friends at uni, but i didn't make it there. i don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. as i've recovered from avpd, i've realised i'm not that weird of a person, and i can actually get on with people fine. but those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. it now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun i am, it doesn't matter, because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore. has anyone else experienced this? recovered but just too late - the damage is done?",4

"i am thinking i might add more. i have cut out personal names unfriend me now to make this easier on yourself. i am going to kill myself now or kill myself later. call the cops to ease your mind, no ones going to find me. waste your time by telling you care when you do not, because i know when all seems good people do not care. give me your reason that i am wrong to say such things. say to me that you have been going through what i have been going through. people with double standards against me, that judge me ignorantly, deny it please, so you can feel better about yourself. i have had enough of every christian with a double standard of love you rather judge than get to know others. you do not know me, because you judge me. and i do not know you because i judge you. if you talk behind my back, you should grow up and talk face to face. but fuck that now, it is too late.so now, know me for the fucking piece of shit i am. i am a fool, i know nothing. but you are wise, discerned, you know many things. tell me what ought to do. i am weak and broken. yet you are strong.no more condescension. no more bullying. no more emotional abuse. for those who are wondering about christianity, a lot of them are just broken imperfect people acting like they are perfect.they ignore fellow believer that struggles with depression. some of them forgive you and cut you off, for something they did that they cannot see. some them lie straight to your face saying that they care for you, and then go ignoring you. some of them are your best friends, that say they are there for you but then drop you like a stone when it gets too heavy. some of them use you, and again for sake of their image, get rid of you, because you are brokenness is too much of a mess. some of make falsehoods about you to justify what they say, when you really just need someone to talk to. also i find it hard to believe that christians would rather isolate you than love you.more than 5 years of wanting to kill myself. i cannot talk about it. people say i talk to much about it, shut me down. people say i should be happy, shut me down. people say i am not the only one, shut me down. now i will not talk about it. now, i will try to be happy. oh now, i know i am not the only one. tell me with your learned words, i am being unfair in my statements. call me arrogant for saying these things for feeling this way. my heart has been filling up because i have been silenced by a hardened heart of people, and now it is spilling over. all i see is evil. christians should not ignore someone who is struggling, we are supposed to represent christ's love, but it seems these people get caught up in themselfs rather then share love. i am joining them, i am going to think about myself as i kill myself. no more christains with double standards of love. people who are so focused on their image ethier online or in person no more. is too hard encourage others? or is it just encouraging specific people you do not like? and again, for those who think i am always negative. you paint pictures that you want to see. never hearing the broken. no more prejudice.out of everything i cannot stand, the most is myself, so i am ending it. i am finding somewhere secluded. and it would be a shame to hear from me again after saying all this crap. i am making sure it is done. also i do not want to be locked up, and go through the same thing that is making me type this.and for those thinking i am seeking attention, use your brain. even if it is that, does not mean it is not a cry for help? but i have to prove to those who think like that. i am going to kill myself, do not worry. i could write book from this heart of pain and thought, so give me your wise words. look at your heart and learn from yourself. this does not apply to everyone, but that does not mean by saying that, you are one the ones this does not apply too judge for yourself fucking look in the mirror and actually look. are not you wise? or do you know that you know nothing? both trains of thought gives you all the more reason to look at yourself.this is the only stage i am getting, my death. let me make a splash, so you can forget about me. i am sorry i am unbearable, it is my fault that i am too much to bear. i am sorry i am annoying, it is my fault. now with your knowledge, hear what i am actually saying. fuck this rant for being stupid. i fucking do not deserve anything. rape me with your words, and tell me how stupid i am between the lines, or something like that. this is sad. no one wants to truly die. however, if you force feed your own words into someone is mouth not giving a someone a chance to speak, they will be voiceless. and voicelessness is what kills. my suicide note tell me what you think",6

they all abandoned me as soon as they could. my therapist recommended me to a different therapist but nobody else took me. she also broke our doctor patient confidentiality and told everyone everything. my principal abandoned me when i needed her most. i am still alone but now i am somehow even more alone. jesus christ i wish i was dead. its so hard not killing myself everyday the people that were supposed to care for me were fake as shit,6
"i have been at it for at least a month now, i will type out some of what i want to say and i will just delete it. its a lot to keep in and i would just share it to a trusted friend or a parent, but i do not have a trusted friend and my parents are the ones causing some of the stress. i will try to keep my mom's side short, basically she broke up with her boyfriend of 10 years and he broke a bunch of shit and left, he is was all around an asshole and one of the reasons i am scared of everything. yesterday my mom picked me up from my dad's and told me she needed to talk to me. at first i thought i was in trouble until she brought up her boyfriend and told me he is moving back in soon. not even a month later and he is coming back, not to mention she complained about having to live at two different places at once, the amount of irony is baffling. i did not say anything and just answered with one word answers which i kind of feel bad about, but i do not know what to tell her. these last two years have been the worst years of my life. i have been thinking about killing myself and i cannot find a reason i want to live, i just do. i like the dreams in my head to much to give them up, but that hardly seems like a reason, i guess it works for now. trying to post",2

"stuck and too afraid to ask for help from anyone because im a disappointment i feel like all i do is go in circles nothing ever changes nor will it, i feel as though i make progress and i think i feel happy for an amount of time and then i get sent back into the hole. hopeless, worthless, a failure and dissapointment to everyone around me who has tried to help and may think that i'm fine not knowing what is going on in my head for fear of criticism or pity, i hate myself. i've fully accepted death although this is not a suicide note or an indication of one, i have previously attempted and for awhile felt no remorse or regret from doing so. and even now i wish i would've given it 100 as i feel i have no use or purpose and all i ever do is dissappint both myself and others, i am worthless. nothing i jave ever done is fulfilling past the honeymoon phase of finding a new hobby, i never have the drive or discipline to keep at it i see the mountain i have to climb and it all seems so pointless to me. and i am left a failure again until i decide to do something else and fail once again. i don't deserve anything i have or anyone that is friends with me. i don't understand what other people see in me i wish even for a mpment i could see myself through their eyes because my own only hat and loath me. i have tried so many times to change how i see myself how i think about myself but it all cokes back to the same place, self hate, hopelessness, and despair. sorry for this wall of text i know this doesn't help anyone and im questioning if its even wirth saying anything. i really just don't know what to do.",2

"i am promising this because i have experienced it.on monday, i attempted suicide, and now i was being serious. before this attempt, i had only self harmed and overdosed in small amounts. on monday i drank an entire bottle of sleeping pills. i was seriously going to die.while i was still conscious, i started feeling regret. for the first time in 2 years, i realized that my problems did have a solution and a date. they were eventually going to end, but committing suicide was the only mistake i was not able to retract from.i felt regret. i felt treater for all the things i did not do. i felt regret for leaving my loved ones behind. i did not have enough strength to call 911, so i just blacked out praying because i still wanted to live. miracles happen, and me being able to write this is one of them.i did not die. i cannot explain how. i drank 100 pills, did not go to the hospital, and somehow managed to survive.today, one of my friends called me. she even invited me to a trip.i thought i was alone. i thought no one cared about me. it turned out to be false. people care. i only had to wait 2 days more.if i had died on monday, i would have died believing a lie. i would have died thinking that my life was doomed. i would have just died in vain.please, stay strong, and know that fighting is worth it. things get better, i promise. they got better for me. they can get better for you too.",2

"anxious about rabies even though there's no reason to i think hey all. i've been having a hell of a week and, to be honest, looking back, it's really dumb but i can't help but be anxious anyway. so back on thursday last week, i was feeding this stray cat. didn't know it was a stray at first since it's a pretty packed neighborhood with a lot of pet cats, so i didn't expect a stray. after a few days of feeding it, it ended up scratching me because i pet it way too much. didn't really worry about it too much, washed the cut off and went on with my day. then i googled what would happen from a stray cat scratch. obviously this was a mistake, but i did it anyway. first result was rabies. cue my panic mode, realizing i could have gotten it from the cat. i started to worry constantly for the next 2 days, and on saturday, i went to the er. doctors didn't think anything would have happened, but they decided to give me the rabies shots anyway just in case. this settled my anxiety for a bit, but i started to worry again, googling if the shots ever failed. they have, but only in countries like india and china, never in the us. over the past week, i've been trying to fight with myself that i don't have rabies. last time i saw the cat was on monday, but since it's a stray, i wouldn't expect it to stay around my house since i stopped feeding it. now, over the past few days, i've started to feel pain in my throat at random times, not triggered by anything. i keep feeling headaches and getting itchiness on my arm not isolated to it though , and i keep thinking food and drinks aren't going down my throat easily. logically speaking, it's nothing, but i keep being convinced it's the rabies starting to cause symptoms now, i have multiple reasons not to believe i'm gonna have anything wrong, but i can't convince myself that. the likelihood of the cat having rabies with no symptoms is low, me getting rabies from a cat scratch is even lower, and me getting it after getting shots is virtually none, but my mind just won't accept that. i keep thinking of what ifs. what if the cat had rabies? what if the scratch gave me rabies? what if i got the vaccine too late? it was 2 days later, that could have been too late. what if the vaccine doesn't work and i still get it? what if my symptoms are from rabies? what if the cat isn't around because it died from rabies? i honestly need some sense knocked into me, i can't stop worrying about it. sorry for the long post.",0

unpleasant. i cannot fucking enjoy any of it. i am heavily malnourished and no matter what i fucking eat , regardless of how much i try, my body does not absorb any of it.according to my last blood tests i have vitamin c deficiency scurvy , vitamin a deficiency, vitamin b12 deficiency and vitamin d deficiency and i take pills for all of those. most are daily. doctor told me to take them just for a while. i ended up taking them for 2 months. did not help.i try my best to fucking eat a ""healthy"" fucking diet every single day. it makes no fucking difference. my body simply does not absorb anything. i do not fucking know why.i was at 70kg months ago. i am now at 50.9kg. and i am 1.65m tall. i look like a skeleton. i am so fucking ugly. i am the ugliest fucking woman to ever fucking live. i look terrible. i look disgusting.and those are not my only symptoms. they are only the ones i am not embarrassed to tell other people about. that is not even the beginning of the fucking humiliation. there is so much more.diarrhea and constipation for me are routine. there are days where i will have to go to the bathroom several times a day with diarrhea until my bowels are fucking bleeding. it is literally impossible to fucking hold. it is like if i ate something bad every single hour of the day, except i was not really eating anything, it was my body alone. and then there are weeks where i will be unable to go the bathroom at all, and the pain is so much worse when that happens. i was given a fuckton of laxatives for those days, and yet all they do is trigger the diarrhea instead. i am fucking terrified of taking any of them.and there are almost no good days in between those. you might have thought there are, but no, when it is not one thing, it is another. i cannot, i cannot, fucking enjoy anything anymore. everything, everything i fucking do in my life is interrupted by either me throwing up, trying not to throw up, shitting myself, trying not to shit myself, or being unable to focus at all due to how much pain i am experiencing.and after several lab tests including blood and stool samples, a ct scan and an mri nothing. all the lab tests showed was that my intestines are absolutely bleeding, and are absolutely inflamed as fuck. imaging exams showed even less. two hernias, and that is it. literally nothing else.and i had to wait so long for these. i do not want to disclose my location but my country has a public health system, and it is literally the only fucking way i was able to afford all of those exams, which is awesome, but because of how underfunded it is, the waiting times between the appointments are long, the waiting times between expensive exams like a ct scan or mri are fucking massive. i waited a full six weeks for this mri. in pain. and it showed fucking nothing.there are so many fucking days where i wish i could just be diagnosed with something like fucking cancer or something just so this would be fucking over. i just want to fucking die. i do not want to go through several examinations and lab tests and imaging and continue to be in fucking pain while i wait. i cannot fucking do this anymore. i cannot. i fucking cannot.there are so many times when i wish i was diagnosed with cancer or something of the sort just so people would fucking stop acting as if i was fucking okay. i cannot fucking study like this. i cannot fucking work like this. i am supposed to be getting an internship soon. how the fuck am i going to do this? i cannot get out of bed. i am so fucking fatigued. i feel fucking awful. i am a fucking skeleton. i cannot even walk all the way to the university, and online classes are going to be over by end of the year. i am going to have to go there again, but how the fuck am i supposed to hold myself together there? i am fucking pitiful.and no one is understanding of it. no one gave a fuck until i got the fucking lab tests that showed i am actually fucking bleeding inside and even then no one fucking gives that much of a fuck. i do not get calls. i do not get anything. people look at me like i am blowing it out of proportion. they do not fucking believe me. i cannot fucking take this anymore. i cannot. i cannot. i cannot fucking do it. i cannot fucking take it anymore.no one fucking gets it. i am in constant. fucking. pain. i cannot fucking eat. even if i do, it is useless. it is like i put myself through the physical burden of eating while nauseous and digesting food only to shit it all out with blood afterward and feel worse and repeat the fucking cycle. i can feel my body fucking breaking down. i am so fatigued. i am pretty sure i will die soon anyway. i simply want to speed up the process and go on my own terms.i just wanted to write this to say goodbye before i do it. i wanted to at least feel like i left something in my depressing fucking departure. i am not religious, i am simply looking forward to the void now, because anything is better than this. anything is better than being in constant fucking pain and nausea every day and still being expected to fucking work and somehow get through university.goodbye. i am killing myself tonight. i have been in constant pain and nausea for months now. i have lost 20kg in 3 months. i am malnourished. no one knows what i have. i cannot take this anymore.",6

"does zoloft help? i used zoloft for 5 days a month ago - didn't feel a thing except an even deader libido, and worse sleep. just wondering if any of you felt easier on it during longer periods, does it help with physical intimacy phobia and other anxiety attacks, panic, etc? i'm going to the gym and plan on doing steroids just to shoot my confidence and libido up, hoping it takes care of everything, but taking zoloft while doing that might be counterproductive. just wondering if some of you had luck with ads, or maybe anabolic steroids?",4

"i know there is a hotline out there but i cannot ever bring myself to call it. i have been having a really tough time over the last few months. i was homeless for a little over a year during the height of the pandemic. i was sleeping on the local trail. i finally found a job with the census and then, eventually, usps. i moved to a different city and landed an apartment with help of a local organization . through it all, i did not have any support. my family the ones i know of have been dead and gone for years. not that they would have been that much anyway. when i finally found a place to live and a job,, i thought things would be a lot better for me. however things just keep getting worse. through my time being homeless, i developed bad insomnia. it is hard being a woman and homeless. i had people try to take advantage of me. i have had people try and bring me to their level addiction criminal activity , but i just kept my head down and to myself. i moved into this apartment where there was a trail of trash on both sides of the hallway, no hot water, drug dealers on the floor, no a c and barely any heat, and landlords that are complete scum. you know i thought anything was better than the situation that i got out of, but i was wrong. the job that i had ended a while ago and i am struggling to find a stable job. i can only find contract work, but i am still able to make my rent. i have not really scratched the surface of everything that is going on.i found a grant that will help pay for me to go to school for an as degree. i haven enrolled, but i just do not know if it is even worth hanging on. nothing ever works out for me. nothing. i feel so much pressure constantly. i feel anxious and depressed and i feel like i just do not want to move forward. i still cannot sleep. i have made an appointment to try and get some help, but i do not know if i will go. what is the point? i really think i am bipolar with ptsd or something. i do not want to feel this way or anything anymore. what is the point",6

"it is not a permanent feeling, but once a week or so, i get really beaten down by my own feelings. there is so much in me that came together over the years, and i do not really have that close of a friend which i can talk to, to get some relief for myself.i am a farmer, but i often feel like i am at the wrong place. i really like working on our farm, but i hate working with my father. with every move i make, i feel like i am beeing tested and controlled from my father. he knows so damn much about all the machines and he seemed to have so much hope in me. i always had good grades and everybody always told me that i was the most intelligent person they knew, but only in theory. when i need to do it in real life, i fuck everything up. i always make the dumbest mistakes that are possible. i am also not a very good listener, i always seem to be in some sort of ""daydream"" leading to me overhearing or seeing the simplest details ans instructions. i am scared. i do not feel like i am capable of handling the farm. i am a pathetic, weak and fat man.i just recently hurt a friend i was partying with. i, almost violently, forced her to drink another shot of alcohol with me. i was very drunk, everybody else was too. normally i do not such things. she probably laughs about this situation know, she more or less took it as a joke, but i hate myself. i hate myself for what i have become back then, what an egocentric and egoistic person the alcohol made out of me. i also feel like i am very annyoing. i am somewhat of a comedian in our group, but i feel like i am becoming annoying really fast.i just needed to release all this. i do not have a person i can talk to about my insecurities. i feel like a failure. i wish i was never born. relief for me",2

"this may be very hard to read for some.as a kid, i was exposed to a lot of explicit material on the internet that i should not have had access to whatsoever. i was familiar with the concept of sex, but not masturbation. my pent up curiosity and sexual frustration lead me to doing some pretty awful things. i was sitting on my couch one morning feeling very horny for reasons that were completely beyond my understanding. my dog was sitting on my lap and when i adjusted myself on the couch, i felt a slight tingling sensation in the private area. initially i thought i had to pee but decided to explore it further as the feeling was completely different than what i was used to. so i kept moving and lightly rubbed up against my dog's back before i reached an unexpected orgasm. i had no words to describe it. i was never too aggressive and the dog was not harmed. i was always fully clothed and reached the orgasm fairly quickly, almost frighteningly so.this happened on and off, very rarely, for the next 2-3 years or so before i finally brought myself around to stopping for good. at the time, i simply just saw this as a convenient way to masturbate because i did not really know anything else.the last thing i wanted to do with this post was cook up any pathetic ""excuses"" that would justify these actions so if anywhere you think i did, please hold me to task in the comment section. acts like this will naturally result in some well-deserved moral condemnation, and rightfully so. i am now fully convinced that i have committed one of the most depraved acts a human being can commit, regardless of age. i was young and stupid and acted out of my own morbid curiosity and i just wanted to express the fact that i am deeply remorseful and cannot apologize enough. are these actions any bearing of who i am today? are suicidal thoughts warranted in this situation? i posted something similar a while ago on a different sub but it quickly got removed before i got many answers so i decided to give it a second chance. my hope is to merely seek closure.i am so fucking sorry i took sexual advantage of a dog in my preteen and i feel like shit about it today",6

"i am sick of everything. sick of high school, sick of being abused at home, sick of just living. i am tired of being told to live for others when everyday feels numb and the same. everyone always say do not die there is so much to live for... but for what? no amount of living will take away this unbearable trauma, depression and heartbreak i have been through.fuck it all, i give up. i am going to kill myself tonight",6
"i graduated from college two months ago and have had two meetings with my new internship. its so hard to keep up and i hate the feeling of needing to ask things like 10 times because i forget everything and feel like i need to triple check everything so no one will be mad at me and so i will not do the wrong thing or make a mistake and have to be corrected. i get i am supposed to be learning and my boss is really nice and tells me not to stress but i feel like i am doing everything wrong and i feel so dumb for not knowing everything right away. i know it will take time but my anxiety has been so bad and i am so exhausted after one task, too tired to work on myself and to try and feel better. i also feel like a failure for not being crazy successful even tho i just started being an adult. its so hard not to compare myself and remember that everyone has their own pace in life. if anyone feels similar just know you are not alone - working sucks",2
"i cannot hold a job, i cannot hold a romantic relationship, i cannot maintain social relationships. i am in pain everyday. i have been to about 30 therapist in 6 years and nothing helped even a little bit. i am tired of suffering, i am tired of being alone, i am tired of struggling to get a job only to lose it. i cannot take this anymore. i am tired of the platitudes, the empty positivity. people say it will be okay, just go to therapy - mindfulness and positive thing are a joke.being raped messed me up sexually and now i cannot even find love. being raped caused me to lose my job and my career. no one believed me, no one cared. my family disowned me, my company fired me. it is been years and i am still broken. i cannot relate to people anymore. i am trying so hard everyday and have nothing to show for it. i feel like sisyphus rolling a boulder up a hill.if i was not a coward i would shoot myself. but i cannot do it, i am just too damn scared. i was born by accident, my mother was a drug addiction who abandoned me. her drug use left me physically deformed. i wish she would had an abortion everyday. maybe i was born by accident, but i will die with intention. world's a sick place with no room for a broken freak like me in it. i will see myself out. good bye. being raped, abused, and bullied has left me a she will of a person and i am tired of being broken and suffering.",6

"i am in my late 20s and i am giving up on love. i do not have anything to offer. i tried so hard to be more attractive but with no results. love is only reserved for pretty girls. i love music, art and books and i would love to have someone to share these interests with me. i tried to be fun and sociable. but now i know its worthless bc i am not attractive enough so i am doomed. guys say all the time that physical attraction is the priority in a relationship. i wish that i could just stop desiring love, relationships. it is torture and it is useless for people like me to want relationships. i am probably a 5 10 on a best day, with makeup on. no guy has ever wanted me for something more serious than a hookup, which is terrible. casual sex just does not feel right for me, i never wanted it and i know it will not fix my loneliness. i always felt like i have a lot of love in my heart but now its becoming empty. there will be no one for me. feeling unlovable",2

"i do not know know if any of you do this but my mind always goes back to the past because modern times is a nightmare. i miss the old world before social media, smart phones, selfies and digital media.the late 90's and some of the early 00's is what i miss the most. nostalgia is a doubled edged sword though because you can dream about it all you want but know you can never can go back which makes the nostalgia so damn painful it hurts my heart. it is like missing a home you can never go back to and now you are stuck in some horrible neighborhood where everything feels fake and shallow and people around you seem like aliens. drowning myself in nostalgia because modern day feels like a dystopia hell hole",2
"i feel like i do not know what to do next. i suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, and i have for a while but for some reason it is just... horrible this week. i do not have the best past and to this day i do not exactly think i am a good person. i used to be aggressive and i did not care about a lot of stuff and i would hurt people physically. i am not like that now but i find myself.... slipping into the old mei was on a walk with my roommates about 2 days ago and i was just talking about science because i thought it was cool, but i guess for some reason she was telling me that it is not true and that it is a theory and stuff. i do not want to call her stupid or anything, but she has a disorder where her mental age is that of a kid. so she likes to act smart even if there is proof that it is right and she is wrong. it is her own thing i guess.but anyway i... slipped into my old self.... i started being a dick and going out of my way to prove her wrong... and it... eventually hit me... and i have not talked much in two daysfriday morning i think i was up early 1 00ish and i went to a bridge... i stood there for about 30 minutes... thoughts rushing though my head. then i went home at like 3 00 since i have not been able to sleep. so i decided to wake my roommates her and her boyfriend and i opened up... and that is something i never did. i told them everything that was going on, about who i used to be... and the part that echos through my head... is when she said something and the way my mind saw it was like... kind of pitty in a way... and i got furious... i grabbed my shoes and i threw them against the wall. then i stopped myself...i eventually went back to sleep... and i ended up crying a good portion of the day. i think my roommates thought i was asleep because they never checked on me. i eventually did fall asleep. then i woke up around 8 00 and i went to find them. maybe they were doing something. they were outside walking around playing pokemon go.i walked with them and i made some comments that... old me would say... so i shut up... that was around 11 00 and it is now 3 00 for me... and i keep having that rushing thoughtif i kill myself who would care? i feel like i do not want to live with guilt and ptsd for things i have done... i keep thinking... i have a plan and stuff to... i... do not know what is stopping me.... that is the odd part... i do not have biological parents i know, i only have adopted parents, who do not really care. my mom says ""if you kill yourself, we will be sad but we will not be broken"" and that hurtsi've eventually come to the conclusion that i do not like my roommate because she reminds me of a lot of things that... old me did....i do not want to be here... i feel like no one loves me and no one cares about anything i do... i feel like.... i am here... suffering i do not want to be here and it is getting worse",6

"wellbutrin making me suicidal? i am a bipolar 18 year old and i have had suicidal thoughts since i was 11, but until a few months ago i was thought to just have severe unipolar depression. i went on 300mg of effexor, which worked wonders for my depression, but made me extremely manic. i went off of it and was on nothing for a month after the initial effexor withdrawal which is not fun . last week i got put on 150mg of wellbutrin bupropion and 12.5mg of lamictal although i m eventually gonna increase to 25mg and ever since the first day of starting this my suicidal thoughts have been through the roof. i m still waiting it out to see if things will get better but i keep getting worse every day. i can t tell if it s the medicine or just my life that s making me feel this way, since it s been pretty awful lately, i have absolutely no friends at all, my dad is dying, i may have a permanent std, i get harassed by men almost on a daily basis, i either get terrible nightmares and sleep paralysis every night or i just don t sleep, i can t leave my dorm without getting extremely irritated by everyone because i can t stand noise, i m always in constant fear that i m gonna gain weight, and more. i m scared to switch medications because 1 i m tired of them just making me worse and 2 i know a lot of antidepressants, especially the ones used to treat bipolar, cause weight gain and i absolutely cannot have that because i know it sounds stupid and shallow but i m conventionally attractive and thin and that s literally the only thing that brings me comfort and keeps me going. should i just stay on wellbutrin and wait it out?",1

"hi everyone, i am sorry to put this much baggage on your shoulders but i have nowhere else to go and could use a little bit of empty as i cannot bear this anymore.i am almost 30 years old, i have been struggling with depression for the last 16 years, always on and off, some days are great some others are unbearable pain and suffering, it is such a horrible roller coaster of emotions that i cannot handle anymore.these last 6 years were great, i only felt suicidal a couple of times which was a breathe of fresh air, i spent those 6 years with my beautiful girlfriend, i thought to myself, this is it, i am here to stay, this is my calling, my reason to be here, to love this woman to the very end, i pictured us together, grey hair and wrinkles, sat next to each other just watching the sun set, happy...i poured my heart and soul on this relationship, i changed jobs multiple times every time taking a step forward in my career, i started working out, even when there was a discussion the last thing i would say at night was ""i love you"" i avoided anything that would make her uncomfortable, never gave her a reason to be jealous, we had our differences and would get into trouble for that but i would encourage open communication, sometimes it worked...yet i am still back here in this sub, after 6 years she put an end to the relationship, she was not feeling loved anymore, what did i did wrong, in trying to understand, i found out she started to talk to a guy in another country, she blocked me from social media so i could not see what she posts, we still talk we are still intimate but there is this hollowness growing inside me, she has made it clear, we are not meant to be together, i feel used, i feel robbed, i feel alone, everyday the pain just grows and grows, it is impossible to handle, i feel so broken again, it is so painful to just breath, this pressure in my chest, the hollow breaths, the frustration, the anxiety, hell i am even typing this during a meeting, i am not functional anymore, i do not want to grow older anymore, i am scared i might lose my job, i do not have anyone to listen to me, i realize i was just trying to find temporary solutions to a permanent problem, i do not fit in this world and i cannot force myself to try to fit anymore, last week i tried therapy but it is too late for me, the trauma of this pain will haunt me forever. everyone night before i go to sleep i spend at least 3 hours crying my eyes out, i try to choke myself with a belt but the fear stops me every time, it is been 3 weeks like this, i wish i could just stop breathing, but i feel guilty, i feel guilty just for being alive and i feel guit, i do not want to leave my mother alone, i would rather die by an illness of accident so she could cash out my life insurance but i am too healthy to die like that, why do i feel like this? she was never a good parent, i mean she tried i guess, i do not know, it just pains me to see my pictures as a child and see what i have become, no one deserve to live like this yet here i am, i hope this will be my last day, i have bought a helium tank and wish i have the will to carry on with this, if the fear takes over again, i guess i will see you around, but it do not get to read you again i wish you all find the peace you are looking forthank you for your time cannot handle this anymore",6

"so i run a club at my local university, i am president. there are several members who maybe out of jealousy dislike me immensely. i know this for a fact because they constantly question anything i do, and make dumb impressions of me. they frequently try to ""roast"" me if you get what i mean, and not in the funny, friendly way, just plain rudely. yesterday, i said, i have reached ""1k games, if you count the other website"". one of them, let us call him ""t"" exclaims ""great you can do math!"". stuff like that, every single day, and they constantly criticize and question for me. but here is where i draw the line. there is a girl i like, and i have never told anyone, but one of the members who hates me is going after her, and trying to call her and stuff. i do not know what he is saying behind my back, but i guarantee it is negative stuff, probably like ""i am gay or something"", or something negative like ""he has problems"". i am furious, i do not have proof, but yesterday he hinted in a very laughably way ""i was talking to this girl for 3 hours lol"" and he was laughing. i trust her, but i am very hurt that i am being targeted like this, i do not want to resign as president over something as silly as this, but it is getting me to the point where i am very visibly stressed and depressed. what should i do? the girl is overseas so it is impossible for them to harass other than frequently call text, etc. am i being a worrywart? should i just chill? what would you do? bulling friends, and people who have grudges against me",2

"i have kind of been suicidal since middle school, but it has not been this bad in a while. i am 241 days clean from self harm and 172 days clean from purging. i am proud of myself. i was in a really good place for a while. but now, every day, it gets harder and harder to resist. its been 3 weeks exactly since she left me. i loved and still do her so much. today i realized she would unfollowed blocked me on various social media platforms. i did not know she wanted so much distance from me, especially since she claimed she wanted to stay friends. i do not know if i can live life without her. genuinely. we were together for 1 year and 7 months and 1 day. it was the best partnership i have ever had. she was the perfect match for me. so beautiful, so fun and vibrant and alive. she is passionate, smart, and so caring. she loved me so much and treated me so well. she made me feel special. but somewhere along the line i guess something just went wrong because now she does not want me anymore. and that truth has broken me completely. i am going to college in the fall and dreading it. i am terrified of moving away from my family, especially my mom. i do not want to go but do not have any other options because all the other possible life paths i can think of going to a different college, staying home, gap year programs, etc sound just as bad or worse. because no matter what i do, the girl i love will not be with me. i just do not think its worth living anymore because i truly feel that the best part of my life when we were first together during my junior year of high school is over. i had literally everything i wanted back then- the girl of my dreams, a lead role in the school play, a bunch of friends. i do not have that anymore and i do not think its coming back. that is why dying feels like a good option. everyone says ill meet someone else but i do not think i want anyone else. id never loved anyone before her. she is everything i want in a girl. i do not even find other people sexually attractive. only her. so that makes me feel like ill just be lonely for the rest of my life. its also really hard to believe that someone would ever see me as worth loving and want to spend their life with me. i think she was my only chance. i tried to text her today because i wanted to ask why she unfollowed me and make sure we were still cool, since i had thought we at least left things on a good note. she did not respond. when she broke up with me she told me she still loved me but i think that love is gone now. that means no one loves me. no one wants me. i am completely and entirely alone and unloved. i do not think i can handle that. so, yeah. i want to kill myself over a girl. its kind of cliche. but the quality of my life has plummeted now that she is gone. no one is helping me. my parents are not taking my pain seriously, my mom gets mad when i cry. my dad does not know what to do or say. i genuinely do not feel like i have anything worth living for. the only thing stopping me is the fact that any method i can think of would probably hurt pretty badly and i have already suffered through enough pain. but maybe it would be worth it. i could be in heaven with my friend who died. i just want my girl to come back. if she did, life would not be perfect, but it would be good enough to be worth living. sadly, i do not think any of you can help me with that, lol. if you read all of this though, thanks. it means a lot. if anyone has any advice, feel free to share it with me. i do not want to kill myself- i just feel like i have to. so yeah. that is all. i want to kms bc my gf broke up with me",6

"i have suffered more than is bearable, and it is mostly the result of my own terrible choices. granted there were things beyond my control, but all in all i had a very good and privileged childhood, with a lot of love. there is mental illness and addiction in my family tree, my parents were both abused as children, and although they did the best with what they have i began to show symptoms of deep depression and anxiety as an adolescent. i started to experiment with drugs and drinking, and i never stopped 33 now . i am not sure which came first, the addiction or the emotional problems, but they seemed to work in tandem. i have lost everything there is to lose but my life, which is also in jeopardy due to a stroke and possible anurysm i do not know, because doctors have been unable to diagnose me, but i pretty much know that is what is going on . every relationship i have had has failed due to my addiction and being a terrible partner. i have not hardly touched another person in five years. i am drinking a six pack a day and using opiates. i cannot help but think of what my life could have been had i not gotten sick, had i not have into the narrative in my mind that i am inadequate and a terrible person. i cannot blame my mother for how she raised me, she was remarkably together considering the unbelievable abuse she suffered from her mentally ill mother. it is just the luck of the draw i guess, but i cannot shake the feeling that my pathetic life was my own creation it was and that it is not going to get better. what would make me think it is just somehow going to improve? i cannot be myself around people, i am so anxious i can barely speak and when i do it is just faking having a personality. i have no soul or integrity. i cannot even control my own behavior or stop drinking. and now my health is failing as a result. i do not think i will make it frankly but i am so afraid of the pain it would because my family that i cannot bear to go through with it. alcoholism and opiate addiction, borderline personality disorder, and living with neurological problems resulting from a stroke and unruptured aynurism.",6

"throwaway because yeah.so i moved in with my partner around 7 months ago. he has both a cat and a dog who are lovely animals and i generally do not have any issues with them. but recently his dog has started pooping and being sick in the house on an almost daily basis, normally overnight. it is not health related or anything but just because she is an older dog. she gets her walks and let out for frequent toilet breaks. now, i am the one who gets up first every morning so i have to deal with the mess, and i will be honest it is really fucking with my head.i do not wake up great to begin with due to my fucking awful mental health but this can send me into this feeling of white hot rage. i generally keep the anger to myself and smoke a cigarette but sometimes it can lead to an argument. it is making me not want to leave my bed in the morning and i have worked really hard to be able to do that on the best of days. i do not really know how to deal with this and it probably just sounds really petty and stupid but i needed to vent so thanks for reading regardless. mental health and pets.",2

"bipolar in a relationship struggling hi, i'm an almost 22 year old female who has been diagnosed by 4 different psychiatrists with bipolar type 1. i have also been in impatient once and am currently treated for my mental illness through therapy and medication lithium and streamline . after feeling good and manageable for a decent amount of time, i entered into a relationship and have been with him now for 6 months. it's hard. i don't know how to explain this... but my reality and perception is constantly compromised by my mental state. sometimes i feel like i'm dreaming... and when i snap out of it or come back from it... it feels like it never happened, but still leaving those i love confused and hurt. i get scared of myself and sometimes don't recognize myself and just seeing a glimpse of myself in the mirror is scary. i feel like a whole other person. my anxiety that the ups and downs brings leads me to want to make impulsive decisions such as cutting out those i love, including my boyfriend. feeling cozy and settled with him or anyone scares me and even happy moments send me fear that makes me want to run. but i don't really want to leave. i just don't what to do? i feel torn between wanting to take care of it myself or want a lot of love and comfort. just another human in the room reassuring me that everything is under control makes me feel grounded and overrides my emotional illusions. one misconceptions leaves me simmering in sorrow for days and days and even up to a month. one sentence feels like it could make or break me. and one reactions feels like it can end my life if it comes from someone close to me... ecspecially if it involves a negative, failing perception i have about myself. i feel like i can't do it. between the sorrow, constant confusion, frustration, and pure exhaustation my brain imposes on me... i want to die a lot. and think about it regularly then feel guilty and resentful about how it would hurt those i care about. i wish i got murdered quite frankly. i can't control that, but it would be nice. that's just bluntly how i feel and what i want since no one here knows my real identity. i try to pretend i have no issues by being fully invested and loved at work. i feel like i have to earn acceptance in my work life but also my personal life because of the burden my mental illness places on others for even knowing me. i love being productive, getting things done, and i'm very goal orientated... and i get so fucking pissed and feel like a failure to everyone but especially myself when my mental illness damages days, weeks, and even months worth of plans or goals. there's so much more i can say. but i really just want to know or hear from people that get it, that understand, that know what i'm talking about. i want to how you deal with. i feel like i'm literally crazy at times. thank you.",1

"many people here, but not all only think people ""deserve"" to have trauma if they were hit every day as a kid but growing up in an isolating, emotionally blackmailing environment as a kid is just as harmful. you will basically have a depressed child that grew up with zero healthy sense of identity or self talk who thinks there is nothing wrong with him or her because they grew up ""middle class"". they end up isolated by almost everyone who is their age and does not even understand why. it does not even stop after one is young either or when you graduate hs. kids like this or ""us"" i guess grow up to be the guy in college who only stays in the dorm 24 7 or goes straight from work to home every single day of the week. and girls who grow up like this will not end up like this so much, but will keep getting in one relationship after another, where the guy only wants one thing from her and basically every time she finds out the guy was just using her for sex or validation. and of course this vicious cycle leads many women to think all men are bad when they just keep meeting other people who are mentally ill but not in the same way maybe her brother who grew up the same would be hope you guys found understanding in this post or related to it well i feel like we as a country the us do not do nuance and mentally ill people suffer for that",2

"i ve only just realised how badly stressed i am but i don t know what to do, no one will take me seriously i, 20f, have a few things that just seem off to me. i have a job that i hate, it s my first job, it s a 9-5 in a high pace high stress environment and when i make a mistake it has an effect - and of course i do make mistakes. my coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as i can never complete a project on time because of it. enough backstory though this isn t a life advice sub i just need to rant about the things i think are caused by stress? i ve always looked young for my age, i take good care of my skin using retinol and spf 50 every day yet my skin is ageing i turned 20 a month ago so this is weird . i look heavier than i am, i get a lot of exercise 10k steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 2-5 times a week depending how tired i am and do not over eat, if anything tw i probably under eat by a long way because i lose my appetite and forget to eat. it s just bizarre to me and it s not that i want to be thinner but i know that with my lifestyle i ought to be a lot thinner than i am so i ve no clue what the reasoning for that is. my psoriasis is getting worse. it used to be a small patch on my leg but now i ve got it on my lips, cheeks, back and it s spreading down my arm. i was researching self soothing and i do that obsessively, i bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. i am always tired even if i get 14 hours of sleep, luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. i also get migraines the second i begin to relax. if it s not pretty obvious ill just throw in that i have been diagnosed with anxiety. my doctor doesn t want to help and there s no free therapy in my area as there s massive wait lists for everything. so i m on here hoping to find someone who might relate. can this all be due to stress? do you have any advice? my job contract ends soon and i m not renewing it don t worry but i know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can i manage it and minimise these symptoms? my family doesn t seem to care and just say it s life but i m going to spiral if i can t control it.",5

"the life i've worked for is gone. when i was 18, i had moved out because i has a strained relationship with my family. i moved away because i wanted to put distance so that the relationship could be repaired. i ended up moving across state lines and then eventually moved down south, halfway across the country, at my father's suggestion for an easier life while i worked and got my degree. and the distance did exactly what i wanted it showed my parents that i was strong and capable and mature and that i was an adult. but it also created a great longing for home. life was easier. i got a better job, i bought a house, and i live comfortably with my husband. but... we don't like it here. we like the small city, the restaurants, the proximity, the healthcare, etc. but the environment and climate do not align with us. we are northerners at heart. we like the seasons, fall and winter, the hills, the mountains, the streams winding through the forest. we miss it so dearly it hurts sometimes. but i also miss my family. i miss my parents, my brother, my nephew. i miss my childhood best friend and her family. i am heartbroken seeing years pass and i am missing from their daily life and they are missing from mine. i am just incredibly lonely here, and i want to be with them. there has always been an obstacle preventing us from moving back, but the biggest one being how expensive it is there, and we would have struggled unless we were finished school and in our well-playing fields. so years pass by and we stay here, while wishing we there. well now my parents are getting older, approaching their 60s. they want to retire, but they don't want to retire there, they want to retire in the state i'm currently in. so then, becomes a new dilemma do i stay in this state that doesn't make me happy, so i can be with my parents and potentially my brother in time ? do i move back home and enjoy my brother's company for as long as i have it, i have my friends, my climate, and my job? either way i'm giving up something that feels non-negotiable for my complete happiness. i'm overcome with this intense sadness that i've spent all the years where i could have had it all being away. and now they are gone and i feel as if the life i have worked so hard in my degree and in life to get back to is gone. ive tried talking to my family about staying in their current state or maybe moving to another state that i know they love and enjoy and that we do as well, and they don't budge - this is their plan. i feel selfish when i push too hard. i don't know what to do. i'm overwhelmed with sadness. i just accepted a job in my career because i just graduated but its even further south and even though its an amazing career opportunity, i feel like its a step backward in the life i wanted.",2

"i have been thinkin on writin here for months.i have been having suicidal thoughts for years, they get stronger at times, n they are back extremely strong right now. nothing seems to make sense. i know everyone hates me. i know the world would be either a better place without me, or nothing would change. i do not know if i want to keep on going anymore. i hate myself so much, and the thought that i only annoy people makes me want to die even more.i tried joining groups of interests to make myself stay alive. because i have to. because others need me. but i do not feel like i fit anywhere. there is always someone better than me. of course. i am nothing special in the end anyway.i both want to die very much but also am scared of death. i feel so pathetic feeling this way. i do not know what to do anymore. nothing seems to help as i seem to always get back into this state. no matter how hard i try. i just wish i was better. but i do not know how i could even do that. i also do not know what i am trying to do by writing all of this n posting it here. i just do not know what to do anymore. i feel so lost. i feel so many things at once yet nearly nothing at all. its all just so confusing and i feel so alone in this. i do not want to bother anyone either. i hope writing this will not turn out bad or anything.i just do not know what to do. maybe all i really needed was to let it out somewhere? i do not know. i just wish i could end this all.",6

"last week, i made a passive choice to stop fighting. this is not my first time here but, i think this is really going to be it for me. these are my reasons why 1. nobody would miss memy family moved out of the country parents siblings and are now permanent residents of another country that i do not have access to plane ticket prices covid restrictions i am a foreigner so i cannot ever just live with them . its funny, they did not even tell me they were moving until they got their passports renewed two months before. i was just in college and they left me here by myself. so yes, i think i have good reason to believe that my death would not impact the day-to-day life of my immediate family. my old friends and i barely talk. i do not have a job or coworkers. i live with my ex and as soon as i move out, we will be going no contact. so there, nobody would legitimately miss me in any way that is actually meaningful. in fact, i could bet you that i could go a month being dead somewhere and nobody would notice. 2. i am not important. like i said, i do not have a job. i do not have friends. i do not have a partner. i do not have anything going on in my life. i do not even have pets who depend on me. if anything, because i cannot find work, i can only assume that my skills and education are useless in the current market. i have nothing to offer anybody. 3. i do not want to be here. id say this is the least important one but if it still matters. if all of the above is true, then what reason do i have to be here if i do not want to be? i have no prospects. my future looks bleak. id rather control my death if i cannot even control my life. so there. these are my justifications. after i leave this apartment, and my ex no longer expects to hear from me, i will find a peaceful place, away from everybody and say goodbye to this world. i cannot say that its been good but i really did my best. i tried very hard for a long time. i just think that i have nothing to offer to anybody or anything. the world will be no different with or without me. i am posting this because i do not think its fair to tell this to anybody irl. i want a quiet exit but i also just want to explain myself. my reasons why",6
my lifestyle and world view for sure seem like a depressed person no motivation almost everything i do is anxiety driven privately my life is a mess and who doesn t feel like we re all screwed nowadays however i usually feel happy or content at any given moment i kinda just don t think about the problem and vibe i m usually having a pretty decent time i m not often sad or cry thinking about the future is upsetting and overwhelming but i try not to i keep getting diagnosed with depression i can kinda see it but usually when i see depression represented it s either with sadness or with no feeling and talk like not enjoying music or anything i still enjoy stuff though is this a thing do others feel this way edit i started lexapro today and went searching for ppl to relate to but i feel kinda alienated from others who are depressed i feel like bringing my energy to other depressed folk would just make them feel worse about feeling bad,2
"been pretty miserable with my life for what feels like the longest time so i am just going to vent some of the thoughts i have been having. my entire life i have felt like nothing but one huge fuck up. when i was younger i could barely sit through my classes and was diagnosed with adhd and was prescribed concerta when i was like 6. i was so young that i could not even swallow the pills whole, my parents has to open the capsules and mix it in yogurt just so i could take it. i felt so awful that i could not do what everyone else could on my own and i think i started spiraling from there. got more and more sad, got prescribed more and more drugs and just kept feeling worse and worse. if you can name a stimulant or antidepressant, chances are i have taken it at some point. i cannot shake the feeling that they have all fucked my head up. i cannot even remember my childhood. i do not have any fond memories growing up at all. i feel like i should feel nostalgic for something, anything to remind me of the better times, but i cannot shake the feeling i have always been miserable. all the adderall and prozac really messed with my head. i have done a lot of weird embarrassing shit that i have no answers for and i cannot ever get it off my mind with the few friends i do have bringing it up all the time. every single time someone brings it up, i feel this seering, screaming embarrassment and all i can think of is hanging myself. i am such a loser embarrassing fuck and all i do is ruin myself. the only way i have gotten through any of it is by pretending it does not exist and disassociating with video games. in high school all i did was go to school and play video games. they kind of became my life for years. collecting them and learning about game history used to be my biggest passion, but i feel like they stopped being fun years ago and i just play them now because that is all i do. i am such a loser disassociated fuck with a fucked up loser adhd brain and i cannot take myself seriously for even a second without wrapping myself in like 5 layers of irony. i can barely tell where i am half the time i can barely sleep at night. people would always tell me that it would get better, that ""oh high school sucks for everyone"" but i am 21 and i feel just as awful as ever. i feel so cursed everywhere i go all i do is fuck everything up. i cannot trust myself to do the most basic of shit without fucking it all up. i feel like a sociopath and i hate it. i do not know what to do with all these thoughts. i have only gotten this far by doing nothing about them, but i feel like if i keep doing that i will end up with a bullet in my skull. last week i got kind of drunk and put a noose around my neck and injured my throat in the process. i am terrified of myself. like i want to die, but i do not want to want to die you know? like of course i would love it if things did not turn out this way, but the way things are now i just want to end it. i feel like i know exactly how to fix all my problems too, but i just feel like i cannot with my retard ass smooth brain. i just keep taunting myself with shit like ""oh if only i was not sped i could actually go to the gym consistently and talk to people and make fulfilling connections and actually improve my life, but i am fucking laying in bed for like 14 hours straight wishing to die."" its the worst feeling i have ever felt in my life and i cannot stop thinking about it. i could go back to therapy, i have had tons of different therapists over the years, some better than others, but none of them ever really made me feel any better, and the last 2 i saw just tried to sell me shit so i am not exactly in the market for a new one. god i feel like i could fix a lot of my problems if i just did not hate myself so much but it just feels so deeply rooted that i do not think i could ever see myself liking who i am and that just makes it so much worse. i cannot help but think what my life would be like if i had never gotten diagnosed in the first place. like would i be the fuck i am now if my head never got fucked up in the first place, or would i be even more of a spaz?so tldr i am a miserable borderline psycho who spent over 15 years taking meds that made all his problems worse and i have not felt happy since middle school. i apologize for how rambly this post is, but it is like 10 am and i did not sleep last night because i could not stop thinking of the ways i could kill myself. i am not really looking for any support or anything in the comments i just kind of felt like venting because i have never actually put any of this into words before. thanks to anyone that actually read this far tho. god i hate myself",6

"i am so tired of being stepped on and hurt. when i try to open up about my feelings with my mom i just get lectured and yelled at about how ungrateful i am and how i do not realize how good i have it. one time i just came home from school and she started screaming at me for something that was out of my control, and when i broke down crying, all my stepdad said was stop. the first time i tried to date, it ended with me on a call with the suicide hotline because she threatened to kill herself when i did not fight to stay with her. i only knew her for two days. the first person i kissed, the first person i cuddled with, the first person to say ""i love you"" to me, the first person i felt comfortable saying ""i love you"" to, turned his back and ostracized me from our mutual friends when i relapsed into self harm. my father sexually assaulted me while drunk when i was 12 and i still live with the repercussions. i could not even do my laundry because i had a mental breakdown. i could not stop reliving it. i could not stop thinking about how it affected my confidence and sense of self worth and still fucking does. all i could do was curl up against the fucking wall and try not to cry. i used to be terrified of people finding out somehow and i was scared that they would think that that was my awakening if i was ever outed. my only friend throughout high school does not ever ask me how i am doing and i cannot talk about being gay around him. he gets pissed or says he would not f me when i talk about it. fuck, i cannot even meme about it without him arguing with me. my other friends, who do not know how bad this hurts, make jokes about how i used to force myself to be straight. they say things like ""remember when you tried to be straight? lol."" as if i could forget. as if i could forget the dozens of fucking times i locked myself in my bathroom with my knife for it. as if i could forget staring at myself in the mirror and wondering what the fuck is wrong with me. maybe something is wrong with me... i do not know. i am scared i am going to try to kill myself soon. i do not want to die yet. i do not want to die until i have felt love, if i can ever find it. i need to know what that feels like at least. but the only other thing keeping me from ending it right now is fear. thanks for listening my terribly organized thoughts n stuff. guess i will ramble now",6

"hi everyone and by the way i am sorry if i am making lots of mistakes while writing this because english is not my first language,so i would like to start by describing my current situation a little bit so i am a 27 year old men, i live in europe with my parents and i was able to find a full-time job 2 months ago. and as long as i can remember i have always kind of struggled to interact with people in general, and i do not know if i have some kind of ""trauma"" because of that, but basically i could go to wherever place in the world and get the feeling that i am being ""rejected"" and judged by everyone and that i am not really welcome anywhere. teachers at school always repeated the same things about me ""he is so quiet"" ""he rarely ever talks"" ""he always seems distracted by he is thoughts when he is in class"" and other things.and it is weird because when i ask my parents about my childhood they are always saying that i was way more sociable than i am now as an adult, but i honestly do not ever remember being that way.anyways so basically i have never really had a close group of friends and i have never had a girlfriend either, which i really feel depressed and even suicidal sometimes about because it makes me feel like i am a failure and i have wasted the ""best"" years of my life and i feel like such a shit and loser almost everyday because of that.and so of course since i am living with parents, my mother in particular is kind of worried about me because she is scared that i will just end up being a loner for my whole life once she and my dad are dead. i have been also worrying about my state for years now, and i honestly do not see any solutions to it. just thinking about myself as a person disgust me so much, all of that wasted time and all those missed opportunities makes me so suicidal.i am so ashamed of myself for not even being able to interact and talk to people normally without overthinking, overanalizing everything and most of all sabotaging myself with different thoughts. pretty much all of my thoughts are about sabotaging myself ""i suck"" ""i am a loser"" ""i should just jump off a bridge or hang myself because i am such a fuking useless and pathetic piece of shit"".and so i kind of just do the ""bare minimum"" i would say to function in society, only interacting at my workplace with coworkers when it is really needed, because i would rather avoid any interaction with anyone at all if that was possible, but unfortunately it is not. when i look into myself i really feel like a robot or an npc from a video game that is just giving the same responses over and over ""yes"" ""no"" and that is it, nothing more, just trying to make the damn conversation as short as possible because it is so stressful for me to handle.i""m kind of angry at my parents for making so much remarks about me not having friends gf because i tried multiple times to explain to them what i was going through whenever i am interacting with people... but they just do not understand and i pretty much gave up on trying to explain it to them.and what is even worse is that a lot of people consider me to be a pretty ""handsome"" guy and some of them even assumed that i must have had lots of gf's hookups in my life, which is not true at all lol. so for me it is even worse because it feels like a lot of my ""potential"" is just completely wasted by this stupid anxiety.anyways i have made an appointment with another therapist to see if she could help me with this problem, but without sounding too pessimistic i really have very little hope that i am ever going to feel better. because i think to myself ""i have struggled with this almost my whole life and so how could just talking about it to someone even help me ?""that is pretty much it i guess, i really hope you guys are doing okey and that you are not suffering too much from sa like i do.what do you guys think about all of this ? 27m mom just told me ""why do not you get yourself a girlfriend ?""",2
"seriously. i am actually so tired of being depressed and i do not have the energy to get myself to function like a person. i should be applying to jobs, i should be trying to make friends, i should be trying to work out start a gym membership. but i just cannot get myself to start. i wake up and am hopeful that today will be the day that i finally help myself, but no. i somehow waste the day watching tv or reading shit though reddit, or looking through different things online to purchase. i am 28 years old. i hate going on social media because it makes me feel like shit, and i hate looking at things my childhood friends are doing because i have somehow disconnected from them through the years, and lost most of my college friends. i feel so alone and lost. i need help. where do i even start? fish oil pills? therapy? psychiatrist? its like i know what to do but i do not know how to do it what can i do make these thoughts stop? to make the pain stop? i need help.",2

"depakote weed? i honestly haven't smoked weed since i started taking meds 125mg depakote, 3x day , so i have no experience with mixing the two. leading up to my diagnosis i was honestly smoking weed way too much and just kind of self medicating my problems in a way that wasn't particularly constructive with a lot of weed and alcohol. but okay, that said, i am capable of moderation - i can do a glass of wine here or there without totally flying off the handle, and i have done so while taking my depakote with no noticeable differences and i was on a much higher dose at one point while doing so . what i haven't tried, since meds, is weed. this is not the type of question i feel comfortable asking a doctor since weed is still very, very illegal where i live lol and i am aware redditors can not dispense reliable medical advice and i am also aware that it is not allowed on this sub . luckily, i'm not looking for advice - i'm looking for personal experiences. i am curious if anyone else has experience mixing depakote and weed? did it make it more sedating? did it make you paranoid or jittery? was everything exactly the same? is depakote and the occasional, rare high any more dangerous than depakote and the occasional, rare glass of wine or beer?",1

"this is a lot, and a long story, the past 3 months have been so hard and i do not know how to deal. this is a vent but also just trying to have someone understand what i have been through i guess. i have dealt with depression along with ocd and gad my entire life, i have self-helped for a decade and started dealing with it more seriously 3 years ago going to therapy. life has taken a big turn in the past year and i am having trouble processing. obviously covid has been a big thing, lost my favourite job bartending at a music venue which was something i was super passionate about and loved. i made a big move to try and start fresh. i was having health issues and while not pinpointing what was wrong with me i was told i may be infertile, which was a lot. bought an amc and started working on it as a project while i was not working and that brought me joy. then while dealing with my health, found out i was pregnant. bam. was not sure what to do, and i just could not go through with a procedure, and although hopeful made sure i made the decision knowing i might be alone in doing it. my sister was extremely supportive. i found a good job, got promoted and found a new roommate who was super excited about living with a baby as my roommate at the time was not sure and that was totally fair. i did everything i could to secure our future. my roommates parents bought a place for rental income and investment, i painted 2 rooms 8 months pregnant because it was not freshly painted or new. made the place my own, set it up beautifully before baby was here. spent my savings on new furniture and everything the baby could need. everything was looking pretty bright, and then i started labour. it went on for 84 hours of active labour, i had absolutely terrible care in the hospital, my epidural failed, the first doctor dealing with me did not tell me anything or helped, and on the 83.5 hour a female obstetrician knew i would needed a c-section long ago. it was so traumatic, and i am so happy he made it here healthy and happy. i hated being in the hospital and i left as soon as they let me, i was sleep deprived and not sane to leave, let alone physically capable after that surgery. when i got home i had no help, i could not move, and i felt so helpless. my new roommate left the place a mess while i was in the hospital and i was not okay. found out my mom relapsed for the first time in many many years after she did not come help me and left me alone in my bed crying for 8 hours, and acting very strange. my roommate ended up being a piece of shit, and told me to leave 2 weeks after my surgery where i could not walk because i was pushing myself cleaning up after her, and doing everything myself because she needed a break. i had to travel and push myself even further. my sister who was previously so supportive abandoned me. i was totally alone. when i came back home, my roommate put all this dangerous ant killer dust everywhere on every window sill, wall, ledge, and was spraying raid in the air like air freshener because of a few ants, that i never even saw. she would not clean it up even though it is dangerous to breathe in for an adult let alone a newborn. she then proceeded to spray raid outside my room at 3am, knocking on my door to show me one ant at 3am to try and prove she was in the right. i had to give my month notice as she would not clean it up. i could not live like that. i left again, it was not safe for me to be there, my breathing and coughing was insane. i had pushed myself so hard that i started bleeding terribly, got an insane fever and had to go to the hospital alone. it was a week after my 1 month notice and i was just going to clean up the ant dust myself so i could pack my things etc. but when i got home every single item i owned was put on my bed, on the floor of my room and it was completely uninhabitable. my dishes, every single last item in storage, in the living room, groceries, laundry room etc. i had a full blown meltdown and just asked her how she could do this to a new mom, a single mother at that, she begged me for forgiveness, said she was so sorry about everything she put me through and since i could not live there that she would give my rent back. i packed everything and put it into storage, moving truck, and supplies it all cost me so much. she played nice and asked me what she could do etc. as soon as i was gone she and her parents landlords blocked me and denied my promised rent back. legally because i had given my notice, i cannot do anything. so i have been couch surfing with a newborn for 2 months. my dad's gf has als and he suggested we find a place together so i could save some money, now i am caretaking a newborn and her. with all this stress and instability my anxiety is through the roof, my ocd back tenfold, and i feel like an absolute failure for my son. all his clothes in storage outgrew, all the new things i bought with my savings a waste. just living out of bags. then i had an extremely painful gallbladder attack as a cherry on top. because storage is in another city i still do not have my things and will not even be able to fit it in the new tiny place, just a small room for me and my son. it is just too fucking much. i feel so ostracized and alone because of covid, just being a parent and not able to do anything, i have been sober because i am breastfeeding so cannot even cope unhealthily for even a night. i cannot afford therapy, i do not have any real help. my doctor think my depression and anxiety are fine because my baby is healthy so it cannot be that bad. i do not know where to start. i love him so fucking much, and he is my world but i feel like i have not even been able to just enjoy being a mother and i feel so fucking robbed of the experience i know it should have and could have been. if i did not have him, i know i would not be here today. i am tired of being strong, i do not feel strong. i cannot stop crying, i am exhausted, i am hurt. thank you if you read this all, and i do not know what i am expecting but i am not doing okay. i have always dealt with depression fairly well but life keeps throwing so much more and i do not know how to handle it",2

"enjoy life with this one weird trick. yes, you are bipolar--or maybe you are the so of a bipolar person. here is one trick that will make 2019 better than any other year has been. quit your addictions. whether it's video games, netflix, gambling, sex, impulse shopping--quit the things that every other person in your life is telling you to cut back on. you know it is holding you back. you know you overindulge in it. i am writing this because i am the expert at overindulging. i've probably spent 10,000 hours or more on video games. if something is stopping you from maintaining relationships and pursuing your goals, get rid of it. burn it at the stake and pour the ashes in the ocean. life is what happens when we are busy making other plans.",1

"i guess i am writing this just to get it off my chest. at this point, i am sure my complete apathy to everything is a result of all of the stress, but i just feel... weird. a few weeks ago i was hospitalized because i had a plan and the means to kill myself. my boyfriend had a feeling something was wrong and stayed with me, and then i just exploded and told him everything. after that, i barely remember grabbing any belongings, going to the hospital, or sitting in the emergency room. i stayed in that hospital for about a day, and then was transferred to psych ward where i stayed for three days before being sent home. tomorrow marks two weeks since i have been out. since my release, i just feel apathetic or absolutely overwhelmed. no in between. i feel disconnected and kind of like i am experiencing a ""muted"" version of reality, if that makes any sense. every day there is some reminder of the fact i almost killed myself and i am still dealing with transferring information between doctors, cancelling travel plans, and trying to exist. i know that at the end of the day, my hospitalization was a needed thing, but i am finding myself worrying that i just took my own pain and created more stress and pain for those around me. that was one of the biggest reasons i never told anyone but a therapist in the first place. i was hospitalized and now i feel apathetic",2

hello guy first time posting here i hope everyone is doing alright at this time i just found out my friend ha committed suicide a year ago first let me give some background my friend is such a gentle loving soul and very devoted to his religion jehovah s witness he is not the most social person around bit awkward and also had plenty of issue in the past mentally due to a rough upbringing we were good friend he d always give me encouragement and just be there for me for anything i wa cut off from the religion due to myself realizing and developing my own belief i don t have a grudge towards the religion or anything like that despite being cut off and not being able to socialize with anyone from that religion cu it s the rule also i felt awkward and embarrassed that i am cut off therefore i did not have the courage to face my friend a year passed i m on a skiing trip with my brother i asked how my friend is doing since he sometimes still go to their church so i figured he d know something he told me he passed away a year so from suicide i am shocked from the news i can t seem to comprehend or accept the fact he seemed to be very devoted to his faith and committing suicide is one of the thing that are forbidden also i feel like trash for being a horrible friend and not even checking in on him at all or at least tried to due to my insecurity my mind ha been in shamble i don t know how to make amends i don t know if i can see the parent they d just be like so now you care where were you thr whole time etc etc i wa hoping to visit his grave but he wa cremated and ash were spread somewhere now all i can think of is his obit picture smiling but i can see there s so much hurt inside that broken smile,2
"so after awhile i have decided to go ahead and try counselling with my school counsellor this friday.this past year has been extremely exhausting mentally. with the amount of stress i am facing, my bottled up emotions and i do not want to self-diagnose childhood trauma are resurfacing. during the past few months, my thoughts and emotions have become harder to control and i finally decided to seek help for the first time. i initially thought that i would go to therapy after i graduate from school but i realised that i do not think ill last that long to make it that far. i was afraid that if i do not seek help soon, i do not think i could hang on any longer. so here is the first step i am going to take even though i was incredibly hesitant at first. hopefully it goes well. going to counselling for the first time",2

"had to put my dog down earlier tonight. i was already in a pretty big depression when she started getting sick and watching her slowly and painfully deteriorate just killed me. i finally let her go and it hurts so fucking bad. she is been my best friend for so long, we have slept in the same bed every night for almost twelve years, she was the first animal that was really mine. i have been responsible for taking care of her since i was like 7. i have felt so shitty the past couple months and i already felt so alone, but yknow at least i could come home and she would always be there. she was the one part of my daily routine i loved. now that she is gone i just feel so empty and heavy and the weight of just how alone and meaningless my life is just keeps creeping up on me. i know i am not going to actually kill myself but i just wish i could be dead. all my problems would be solved if iwasnt alive anymore. i am not even afraid of death i am only keeping myself alive out of guilt of not wanting to make my parents sad. i know i am grieving and it takes times but once the grief has passed ill still just be exactly where i was before only without that tiny bit of joy and support that gave me some meaning. it just fucking sucks and i do not believe its going to get better. what is even the point",6

"a few months ago, around march, i attempted to starve myself on two occasions, as dumb as that sounds. i kind of always knew deep down it was a very implausible ineffective method. the first time i only lasted two days without eating, the second attempt was four days. i did it when i was home alone but both times i had to start eating again because my sister arrived at our place. i had to pretend that everything was normal so i had to let her see me eat at least a little until she left again, but when she did i was no longer committed and did not continue my attempts even after she left.in in a much better place now. i am no longer attempting suicide, i do not even know why i am writing on here now so many months after. i guess i had not even processed or had not admitted to myself the fact that i have actually attempted suicide twice now. i guess i just needed to get it off my chest. it would be nice to hear from some of you guys.looking back i cannot help feeling so pathetic for picking such a stupid method. i am not anorexic or anything, if anything i wish i could put on more weight. i have severe gastritis and heartburn issues so it really hurts to eat, may was particularly bad. i just wish i could eat without it hurting again i am tired of the chronic pain. suicide attempt by self starving twice",6

"uti...or not so i woke up on friday having very mild symptoms of a uti, just a tiny bit of burning after peeing. i immediately drank a ton of water to flush. afterwards the burning was barely noticeable but i know it was still there. saturday morning i wake up and it s still barely noticeable but still there so i make a doctors appointment. unfortunately, my regular doctor isn t in that day and neither is my usual back up so i book with the only doctor that s in. at this clinic for as long as i could remember i ve gone here for over 10 years they usually give you the results of the urine sample before you leave, keep this in mind that was the only reason i went because i convinced myself the only thing this could be is a uti or perhaps something worse even though i know i don t have any of the symptoms but you never no right? it s better to be safe. anyways, she comes in and i explain my problem. at first she mentions it could just be irritation and she mentions something in particular that i do to dry my nether regions and i thought wow i could of actually cut myself or overwashed and a wave of relief washed over me. because i do tend to overwash and use scented products. but then she said she would prescribe me a medication if i have a uti. she left and the nurse came in a few minutes later. the whole thing took 5 mins. the nurse comes back in saying i won t have the result for three days and i m confused so i call in the doctor. and she said there s no harm in taking it even if you don t have it. this goes against what my usual doctor says, she never suggests taking anything unnecessarily. especially when it comes to a urine culture. because of resistant bacteria or something. anyways i left and picked up the medicine but it occurred to me she didn t ask many questions...so that left me thinking it could be something else. like a cut or a yeast infection or just being incredibly over washed. she didn t even ask if i was sexually active or not or if i was having any other symptoms or if my period is due. but i was also in shock by how impersonal that visit felt as it s not what i m used to. so i have the medication but you know, me being anxious i don t want to take it unless i have the results of the culture. at some moments it feels like i m just irritated down there given what happened during the week leading up to these events. i quit using the regular soap i was using down there but i stilll used it for the rest of my body and if some slips down there it does burn. but sometimes i think omg did i just had a tiny muscle pain in my back is it an infection. or regular body sensations freak me out. i m really trying to relax but my mind keeps racing to all sorts of things",0
"""it does not matter because we are going to kill ourself"" that is what i said whenever things happened. i always said 'we' because i feel like there is someone else inside this body who still wants to be happy, to be alive, who wants to be saved. i am not sure who is in there, it could be my childhood self or whatever else it is called.i am so sorry, after everything you have been through, you do not deserve to end this way. i wish, i could separate myself from this body so the other self can be happy. i am so sorry that i do not want all of this anymore. i am sorry. i am sorry to other self inside this body",6

"title says it all.round-about 1 month ago today i attempted to be helpful in a community only to be met with claims of homophobia amp spreading negativity, despite what i said equally criticizing everyone involved and encouraging being open and kind.on that same day, i contemplated suicide for what i could only hope would be the last time, believing i had done nothing but proven to be my own worst fear.today, one month later, i gave an attempt at reconciliation my absolute all.today, i allowed myself to be vulnerable for the first time in 3 years.and today, i was rejected in the worst way i can possibly imagine.i wrote my most deep-seated apology to those i had wronged and to those who believed i was nothing more than an unapologetic piece of shit. i posted it, and i waited.i waited 5 minutes, then 15 minutes, then 30 minutes. before i knew it, i would been staring at the screen for over two hours, waiting, praying for someone to say something.after two hours i got a response, and all it did was make everything so much worse. it solidified my view of myself, being unable to do right despite my every attempt, my countless efforts done in all manner of ways.two hours of waiting, and all i got was someone telling me that i was banned for a reason, implying that my effort, despite it being done in the nicest way i could muster, was in vain.if you were to tell me 1 month ago that attempting to be kind would because me to, in a way, spiral down a rabbit hole of self-pity and self-loathing i would have called you a pessimist. i would have attempted to justify it with optimism and passion that is rarely seen these days.but now? now i would call you a speaker of nothing but the truth, in that regard.it is the sad reality that i have now come to realize encompasses my whole being. the sad reality that i am a broken light in the dark tunnel that is everyday life. a light still sputtering but quickly losing its function. i am not sure where else to post this really, take it down if you all must but i feel it can be good to read for those feeling down. to see that maybe their day or maybe their situation is not as bad as it first appears. today, i tried and absolutely failed to be a better person.",2

"health anxiety, what has worked for me - hopefully it helps you i have health anxiety and it's taken me about 3 years to. it feels good to know that i am not crazy or feel like i am dying from cancer or having a stroke or whatever else it can be. the symptoms are all over the place one month it will be numb limbs, the next month my face feels tingly, the next month i have shortness of breath, then the next month is muscle cramps, the next is heart palpitations. each time i i've been to the doctor so many times its kind of silly. here are some ways i cope with it. i have days where it's gone, mild days, and days where it's an episode. i am glad i found this group because it makes me feel like i am not alone. it's hard to talk with people about your health anxiety because most people don't understand. i think it's fine for people to not understand we all 1. i see a cbt therapist 2. i channel my thoughts into something creative painting, woodworking, reading, writing, drawing etc. 3. i keep a journal about the symptoms day to day occurrences 4. i listen to classical calming music before bed 5. i allow myself to worry for an hour a day 6. in the morning for about 10 minutes, i tell myself i am healthy, people love me, and today will be great, you will be ok. 7. i laugh talk about it with my friends not for everyone but it helps me to know that some people have health anxiety at a mild level 8. i note all of the things that happened that have made me feel better and then i repeat them, in addition i also write down all of the things that made me feel bad and try to articulate why that make me feel bad. 9. little to no caffeine, i love coffee but limit myself to drinking coffee on good days. as coffee can sometimes really amplify my symptoms. 10. little to no alcohol, i limit my alcohol intake to social events and never drink on weekdays. i noticed that alcohol while it suppresses my symptoms it makes me into a monster emotionally, so i only drink when i am having a good day and not worried about anything. 11. find a hobby. i like to sail, a hobby that requires concentration around the boat and everyone on the boat it helps me be mindful of my surroundings. it's something that has me forget about the symptoms because there is no time. this one took me about a year but i am glad i invested my time into it. this list is a work in progress, my recovery has been slow and each month i set a small goal for myself. in the midst of the anxiety it's important to realize that recovery and healing take time it will never happen overnight and i think understanding this and setting very small goals has really helped me. my list above is months of testing out different methods to see what worked for me. just remind yourself it takes time, you are not alone.",0

"my english is not that good, sorry but i hope you understand it anyway lolso uhm i am 19 and currently moved out and since then things got really really worse. i am in therapy since i was 16 because of different things. it began with social anxiety, later came an eating disorder, anxiety disorder, depression and alcohol addiction. when i had only my social anxiety things were okay but since i have my anxiety disorder everything is so fucking hard. i got diagnosed late 2019 and the first months it was ... okay. i could live with it. i had a lot of friends, was always outside and when things got bad i drank, and then was everything okay again. but late 2020 it suddenly got so fucking worse. i got diagnosed with depression. yeah ... at the beginning of this year i thought the first time about suicide. i was always drunk and lost all my friends. in march i went in a clinic for 6 weeks and wow i felt so good. i thought i could handle my anxiety and everything will be good again. and when i went back home everything got bad again. the circumstances were the same as before the clinic. i was raped mid 2020 by some friends, a video was sent around my city and everyone thought i was a slut. since then i could not go outside without feeling so worse and without getting a half panic attack. being in my city was so awful for me. and i felt the same way when i came back from the clinic. suddenly all things i learned ... were gone? i do not how to describe it. i hit rockbottom again. i was at home for 2 months - without friends to meet with - and did absolutely nothing. it was awful. i moved out 2 weeks ago and yes it got more awful lol. i wake up with anxiety, then i watch netflix all day to not think about anything, i drink again, i cry a lot and a few days ago i cut myself for the first time. i cannot even go outside without having a panic attack. i have nothing to eat anymore and must go to the grocery store tomorrow and i am so fucking scared. some friends visited me last week they live far away and i only see them once a year, so i did not mentioned them and even then i felt anxiety when i was outside with them. i do not know what to do anymore. everything should be good! i moved away, can start a new life, my formation uhm idk if this is the right word sorry lol my new job begins next month but i feel miserable and i think about killing myself so much. i think the only reason i do not want to do it is my family. i really really love them. my little brother ... the thought that my parents tell him i killed myself, oof. the life of my parents would be destroyed. i thought about talking about my thoughts with my mum but ... idk. what can she even do? i do not know what to do, i am so tired of trying, of living, i do not think anything will change. i do not want to live with my anxiety, i fucking cannot. that is not the life i want to live. always fighting and fighting ... fuck man actually i do not want to die, i know how beautiful life can be but i do not think it will ever be that way for me again. gosh i do not know what kind of answers i want when i even get some lol . i am so sorry for this long - not really good written - text. thanks for reading lt 3 thinking about suicide",6
its a long story but to sum it up we both fell so in love with each other instantly but then we realized we both needed time and space to heal and work on ourselves before we reconnect. in that time apart i made so much progress and she was doing the same. until one i night i sent her a late night text on her birthday saying that anyone after her is and the beginning of the text i sent said i believe my soul is giving me no choice but to send this to you yadayadayada after that she blocked my phone amp insta immediately. once i saw her do that i immediately became suicidal and have been ever since. all i ever wanted was her and the life we were going to create together and i blew it. i am an attractive guy that can obtain another woman easily but i do not care for anyone else. now i spend my days online seeing other people being suicidal and speaking about doing it. i guess it helps? in reality it does not its just a time killer until i eventually go through with the act. i deleted all social media accounts. have friends i could contact and go hang with if i wanted but that and just putting in effort to live again seems utterly pointless. its like time is just ticking away until i am gone i am ready to exit. i am 30 and i lost the love of my life before it truly began.,6

"my mom found a bunch of old pill packages from when i did pills. i have been off of them for almost a year, and my mom is convinced they are new and i am going to overdose. i tried telling her that they were not from any time recent. she just says i am lying and now i am grounded from my friends. she goes through my drawers and searches my room. i am currently 17 and feel like i should be granted some form of privacy. she outright said she was going to continue going through my room and is convinced she is right and i am lying. i had a drug problem in the past so this kind of behavior would be normal 2 years ago, but after almost 2 years of sobriety from hard drugs, and the work i have put in to mend my relationship with my family, i feel like my effort is being ignored and my mom continues to call me a liar tomy face. she always pushes her religion on me, and will not allow me to be vaccinated due to her believing that vaccines are the mark of the beast. yet i am the one who needs help. i am just so ready to leave this house. my parents will not allow me to get an id so i cannot even work to save up for an apartment. literal tyrants run my life. my parents never believe me",2
"i do not know if this is the best place to post this, but i needed to write my thoughts down. my father told me today that hes arranged to go for a week holiday in september with his friends. i have not had the chance to be alone for longer than 24 hours for awhile now so i felt in my heart like this would be the perfect time.i have been wanting to end my life for awhile now. i attempted to take my life about 2 years ago, i was so broken but in the end i was stupid enough to think there was a glimmer of hope and i did not go through with it all the way. since then i have received help and support from my family and a few friends which i am so grateful for but in the end nothing has changed. i am such a burden and waste of space on everyone and i am still the empty she will of a person i have always have been. i have not got any better, only worse. so the thought of ending my life brings me comfort, knowing ill have peace at last and the pain will stop. so i have waited it out, just drifting through limbo until the opportunity came.i have always been subconsciously planning to get things organised after my first attempt. in some sense i have been slowly making sure all of my accounts and belongings are in order so it will be a little easier for my family in some way. but now i have two months to really plan and organise it, but i have do it in such a way that my family will not notice anything off.i like to be organised, even with death i guess. so as well as how i am going to end my life. properly this time, i just need look in to things like -my student dept and what happens when i do pass away, will the debt so straight to my parents? i want to pay so much off now as i can so if that happens its not as much for them. -make sure to leave them letters and also leave my usernames and passwords to my bank, phone account etc.-which would be the best day to do it, towards the end of my fathers holiday? so if that my mum calls on the day and i do not answer, she would ring my father in a panic and he would have to to leave his holiday earlier to come back to open the house to check on me. i cannot think of anything else while typing this right now but ill make posts on here as i go. i am writing this and posting it on here in hopes that my family or friends might find peace if they ever come across my reddit account. i hope they will know that i loved them with all my heart but this is truly what i wanted. or ill probably just delete my account towards the end. but i just i feel better writing it all down. my two month plan",2

looking for perspective i f18 have been given the diagnosis of gad generalized anxiety disorder and it has taken an extraordinary toll on my physical health. i am in a constant state of fight or flight and i ve never been in this much pain in my life. it s the kind of pain people kill themselves from. i am constantly shaking and throwing up. this constant stress has given me the diagnosis of ibs irritable bowel syndrome . i had to go to multiple doctors as ibs is hard to diagnose. the stomach pain triggers the anxiety and the anxiety triggers the stomach pain so basically i m constantly in both mental and physical pain. however i believe it goes deeper than gad. it doesn t stop. it s not attacks either it doesn t come or go.. it stays. i ve taken benzos and they don t do shit for me and neither does any depression or anxiety medications. i wish i could be sedated so i don t have to be awake and in pain. there have been a few incidents where i had to go to the hospital and beg to be sedated or at least booty juiced or something that would put me to sleep. luckily i found lamictal and it has saved my life. i honestly don t think i would be alive today if it hadn t been for modern medicine. but this still raises the question of what is actually wrong with me. i m thinking of this because my lamictal is beginning to lose its effect and i have to increase my dose every couple of weeks. i couldn t get a therapy appointment scheduled until late june so i m kinda fucked.,0

"i am at a point where i am on the road to a mental breakdown. i really wish i had the courage to end it but i know ill never go through with it because i have a 2 year old son.it started four years ago when i was in an abusive situation with a guy who was much older than me i was so in love but now i realize he was a narcissist. one night he said something degrading and i decided to leave but instead he assaulted me. no one believed me not even the police. i later found out that this well put together person had had other restraining orders against him and had been in prison for eight years. that was shocking. anyway, i developed ptsd.the year following this i started drinking heavily on the weekends to forget. i also exercised a ton and lost a lot of weight. that is when i met the father of my son. i thought he was a great guy and he treated me so well that i let my guard down. i was so scared of having sex but i did it. i told him about my sexual assault and was understanding. i found out i was 5 weeks pregnant. i also found out that week that he had a girlfriend whom moved down two months after i discovered my pregnancy. that made my ptsd spiral out of control. i regained composure and was thankful that i was pregnant and made it my mission to have a great pregnancy. quite frankly, i never want to date again nor do i miss sex. my main goal is to be a mother. well, my little boy is two and i beginning to suspect he has autism and its taking a toll on me. not only am i having suicidal ideation because of this issue but the assault issue is coming up and i keep thinking about it. i also have a lot of resentment toward my sons father for not helping him through this trying time. he knew i was pregnant and could care less what happens to his son. hes never seen him and he even blocked me. anyway, i just needed to get this off my chest. i wish i had the courage to end it but i do not. i really should have ended it four years ago. i would not exist and my son would not either so neither he or i would be suffering so much. single parent and suicidal ideation",6
to start off i used to be a really fucking depressing person where i always selfharm and thought about suicide. around 6 months ago i met my amazing bf who is truly a catch but hes been making me really sad lately. when we started dating i was so happy and felt like i was in a romantic movie until things started happening. each time something went wrong with us i started getting more and more depressed which i try not showing. i am getting to the point of cutting and maybe suicide. i do not feel like i am enough and since i am a drop out and do not have anything that i am currently doing with my life what is the point even living for someone who does not respect the boundaries or even respect me. i know people would say break up with him but i cannot i am too in love and if i do i really feel like ill have nothing to live for. he has not cheated on me if some of you are wondering its just other things that ill rather not share i am starting to go though what i did before..,2

"in my mid 20's and worked shitty jobs all my life in my locality. i do not have any prospects, and no pathway to something to drag me out. do not even have a general area to pursue, which makes it difficult to even get motivated or hopeful. the past year has been even more isolating and difficult, and i feel like a she will of a person now. if i am not in work it is difficult for me to even get out of bed, cos i do not see a point anymore. talking to friends is triggering because i do not even remember the person i used to be when i was alive, so i have pulled away a lot from them. i do not know how or where to begin, or if i even can get back to a position of existing beyond living on autopilot. being reminded of events a few years ago is like reading about a stranger, and i do not even know who i am anymore. it is hard to express this, and i do not know if anyone will understand or relate to what i am saying, but i feel totally lost and hapless at even expressing my current outlook and emotions. at a certain stage i will not have it in me to even keep this up, cos the struggle is gnawing away at me day by day. is it too late?",2

"everything in my life feels weird, i am happy-sad all the time, and productive but also burnt out, i could keep going about how i feel like there is a direct contrast between most aspects of my life but i want to keep this relatively short.honestly i am just writing this to get the thoughts off my chest because i know i will probably forget about this tomorrow. i do not know if i have any mental illness but from what i have heard my symptoms are closest to depression. i am 18 and i feel like i have the perfect life but i have never been able to enjoy it. i do not know where the constant sadness goes or anything. i went to a great high school and did well academically and had a decent amount of friends and a great friend group. alright, that is the context and i will now get into the depression symptom stuff. i have had thoughts that align with nihilism since i was like 13. i have this constant battle that feels like it is going on in my head between happiness and sadness. i have what feels like euphoric episodes that last a few days, so maybe that is just happiness? idk, but it does not really last. every good phase i have comes with a crashing low that drains me and leaves me with my thoughts and i do not know how i get out of it but it just a cycle. i do not fit into what i always thought depression was as i an able to be productive and do really well but i just burn out after. i cannot find any interests for most of the time and then i get super hyper focused on something and it feels like it is my calling in my life. i think i had been numbing my thoughts for nearly a year and just tried to think no thoughts and it worked but it left me feeling stupid as shit. i do not know how i return to how i used to be when i was less depressed or whatever or if i even can. i might add more to this and explain more but this is just all the thoughts that are running through my head. i do not know what i am looking for out of this post but if you want to say anything, feel free to.also, is it normal to think this is all in my head? like i am manifesting it or doing it to myself or something i feel like an oxymoron",2

"to keep it short, last year in summer i graduated from my education. the time in school was easy to say pretty hectic, considering that i was suffering from massive headaches, anxiety and concentration problems. this could be reflected on my results in school, people would say that i was a lazy student and should work harder. i was very stressed out and, as opposed to the other students, i chose to spend my time differently after getting my diploma.this was a decision that i made in consultation with my parents. they took it very seriously and were very supportive and so i visited the doctor who figured i should see a neurologist. after a few appointments and a multidisciplinary research, they found out i was suffering from chronic migraine. at this point in time i was very happy to conclude that i was not crazy or anything, there was a serious reason to all of this pain i was suffering from for all these years.all of this time i spent most of my time in bed and playing videogames, because there was not really that much else i could do without overexerting my body. playing videogames was like a nobrainer and it gave me the sensation of escaping from reality.some more appointments followed up and i finally got a medication prescribed which could help me with the migraines. it was still not enough to get rid of the daily headaches so they gave me another medication called candesartan... and luckily again, this reduced the pain by a big amount, but also the frequency of the migraine. i was feeling so much better now, but yet i was feeling that there was missing something.i was still very tired and bad at concentrating. here is where i started to see a psychologist which referred me to a psychiatrist. this is where i get diagnosed with add, as of now i am still in the midst of getting medication for the add.now the problem is, with all of these appointments a lot of time has passed. it is been a year now since the start of the sabbatical and i am still at home. i realise that i get a lot less joy from doing activities, but yet i know that this is temporary which makes me fight through this dark period for hopefully once and for all.in the beginning i did nothing else other than spending my free-time playing videogames when the migraine was very bad, but that was also partly because i was trying to avoid thinking about my area of expertise since i had a lot of anxiety of failure during my education and it gave me stress which i had never experienced before.finally since a month or two ago, i finally started working again on hobby projects and realised that all of my knowledge had not left me behind. i was starting to feel more and more confident and until now i am developing a good portfolio for when i want a job. i am making a lot of progression on building websites and feel very confident, especially because my friends compliment me for my work.but please, this depressing feeling, please be temporary. i just really hope this is something that occurs when unemployed for some time. a friend of mine told me that this sure is the reason. right in this moment i am on vacation with my family, but i feel like i cannot enjoy it to the fullest. taking time off a sabatical to work on my problems made me indirectly pretty depressed",2

"question about seroquel hi everyone. i'm not sure if there is a better place to ask this. i'm not bipolar but i am prescribed seroquel which i know is common for bipolar so maybe someone here has some advice or info i am on 150mg day of seroquel. been on that dose i believe for about 8 months. i was also in a car crash around the same time i started on this dose, prior to that i was taking 25mg every few days for sleep. i've noticed since then that i am having awful muscle aches and pains. i noticed it in my back first and got physio thinking it was from the car accident which wasn't a bad accident but i didn't know what else it could be . the physio helped some but i'm noticing other muscles are hurting a lot, every day. my right arm will get numbness a fair amount and extreme pain. i'll also have random areas eg. lower leg that will start hurting for a day then go away. is this common? could it be the seroquel? i want to come off it but not sure how fast i can do so. any help would be very appreciated!",1

"in 2016, after living by myself, i had to come back to my parents place. i was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.the 2 following years were pretty dark, i did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.in 2019, i finally found a job that was perfect for me. i knew the place, my boss was very understanding regarding my shyness, anxiety etc , i was good at it, i got my first salary and the first car etc things were getting much better.i did not move out because i was working part time, meaning i was not earning much, and i chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. then my contract ended and i have been looking for a job since last january. i have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea, super confident, but i barely get any feedback and when i do, we proceed to have an interview but then i do not hear back from anyone.i was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him which i am happy about, my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives , and my brother left too, so now i am stuck with my dad i cannot even look in the eyes, and broke. i was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. that hurt too but i want to let her live her life with him, she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.i know i could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime, but as i mentionned, i am very discreet, anxious, shy, but also clumsy, distracted, and i am pretty sure that i would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications. i do not feel capable of doing anything i do not know alreadyim very alone. i got a couple friends and i am thankful for them but my social life is far from being exciting and my love life is simply inexistant. i was relatively fine with it because frankly relationships scare me, so i was kind of at peace with it, but considering my current situation, that lack of love is adding to my list of what is making me feel worthless. someone that could make my heart feel a bit lighter would not harm right now.if you read it that far sorry, that was a lot of self pity. i needed to get that off my chest.i know i am most likely not dealing with things in the best way possible and could certainly do more, please do not come at me too hard for it i am trying i feel trapped and defeated",2
"i was just accused of hitting my dog by my brother i did not i went to move his collar around to hook him to his leash to take him out after he pissed in the bathroom again and he yelped . i was just called an asshole, a fucking retard, a piece of shit , a liar a waste of space, worthless fucking liar a fucking sped he just screamed it all in my face. i did not hit him but my brother was ready to hit me because the dog yelped. i am already in a bad state of mind and now i am contemplating making a permanent exit from this shitty world i turn 29 tomorrow .why does everyone assume the worst of me? am i really an evil person? i really feel that my brother and the rest of my extended family would be genuinely happy if i was gone. i have always been the outcast even in my family, i do not know what to do anymore. i have nobody to talk to and nobody i can ask for help.i did not hit the dog he would not have followed me to my room and laid on my bed if i had. but i am still going to be the evil horrible rotten person that cannot do anything right and deserves nothing but being a punching bag for everyone.maybe that should be my birthday gift to myself. a permanent way out of this life that just seems to get worse every day. i wonder if it hurts",6
"i have been feeling intense physical symptoms because of depression. i cannot tell if gravity has gotten stronger or if my body just got heavier. also i feel dizzy and i am dissociating most of the time i am awake. i am very lonely most days and when i am not i am with people who make me feel way worse most of them, the only one that does not i am not close to . i am not accident yet but i have been through a lot of shit and all the trauma has rendered me useless. i feel pathetic and i had my fair share of near death experiences in the past but i think i want to try again, i consider it everyday but some days it is way more desirable. i am sure no one would care. my life is falling apart and i have no one to trust through anything so what is the point. people generally dislike me because i am socially inept i do not try to be rude and i do not think i am but i have a hard time communicating with people because of anxiety , and i am ugly. there are too many things i wish i could do but i cannot because i have limited resources and energy for that matter. yet at the same time i have no real goal in life anymore. i think i did at one point but the more i go through the less i care. i have intense paranoia because my parents in the past have invaded my privacy alot so i only have reddit. the paranoia is killing me and i feel like i cannot do anything without precautions. i could keep going for ages about the pathetic state of my life but there is always going to be something is that are unsaid so there is no point. idk. i just want to start planning again on ending it all because nothing is working. feeling gross and miserable, cannot think of a better title.",6
"every morning i wake up an hour before my alarm and toss and turn dreading the day of work to come. i get to work and almost cry some mornings wishing i was anywhere else. sometimes i feel ok most times i feel like crap. my brain is constantly running and i always feel tired even though i sleep fairly well. when work is over my thoughts instantly go to my next shift and the dread starts over. i lie in bed all day thinking about the job i have to do the next day. my job is not exactly stressful or that bad honestly. there is some manual labor and i stay busy there. i enjoyed it for the first year or so but now every task i am given feels like an overwhelming obstacle. i constantly worry about making mistakes and screwing something up. i have been told numerous times by my bosses and coworkers that i do a great job but i just cannot shake these thoughts. i recently started lexapro 5 mg and it feels like its making it worse so far. i also binge drink heavily on the weekends and i believe that is part of my anxiety too.i have not been eating as much as i used to. i just want to be able to function again, i was fine for so long and all of the sudden a few months ago i started to spiral. i wish i could find a way to fix this. i cannot shut my brain off.",2

worried i have ovarian cancer. the more i'm on social media the more i hear about 'silent killer' cancers. i read that a common symptom of ovarian cancer is being bloated and feeling full quickly. i feel full a lot and never really finish my plate and i often have a bloated stomach. i pee pretty frequently too. i just feel so stupid going to a doctor with these sort of symptoms. i also have a fear that a doctor will wrongly say that i'm fine and then i'll be all relax while the cancer spreads inside me. there's so many different types of illnesses to consider and be at risk of. it drives me insane.,0
"to php or not to php i went through a hypomanic mixed episode for the past two and a half weeks that came to a head on wednesday, resulting in si. i m no longer experiencing the si and had a med change, but was asked if i d be open to a php. today i received the intake phone call, and they want me to start next wednesday. if my existence within the bipolar lens is continuously cycling and from stable to unstable if i m no longer experiencing the si do i still participate in the php? i don t currently have any providers other than my psychiatrist, which is definitely an issue. i m also worried about taking the time off work because i have a big project due soon and my colleague is out. all in all, it s only 5-7 days so do i do the one thing i have been putting off for years because of school and career, or do i put myself first and participate? is it worth the time, effort, and disappointment of my boss, knowing that i m going to cycle for the rest of my life?",1

"i feel like i remember almost everything that has happened in the 14 years of my life, even super small things. and looking back on everything just makes me realise how miserable my life really was, i have realised how shitty my family was and also all things i have missed out on in life that all my ex friends got to experience. looking back on everything makes me feel so weird and life feels so alien to me now. its like a feeling of nostalgia but in such a depressing, ugly, gross form. its also making me feel conflicted, as if i do not know who i am or have been, nor what i want. i cannot even tell if i want to be happy or not. it also feels like my life is flashing before my eyes and that my life is coming to an end soon. at the same time i have been having anxiety of the world ending and being apart from the person i love, but i am not sure if the two are connected. either way i am thinking so much about life and death right nowi've tried looking for answers but i have not gotten any. i do not understand any of this, i am 14 and i have been depressed since i was 10 but i have never experienced something this low before. i cannot tell if its an existential crisis or not but it is so fucking depressing my lord. for some reason this only happens during the day but at night i feel kind of okay about it. idk i have been feeling so reflective on my life recently",2

"he asked if i wanted to fight multiple times but i never fought him because i was scared of getting a black eye or something like that, because he was bigger than me and had tattoos and was obviouslly insane. i know why i did not fight, because if i did i would be wasting time that i couls be using on work, and there would be a possibility that one of us would get really really hurt really badly, but i still feel like a huge coward for not fighting him, maybe me feeling a coward is something he projected onto me, because the look in his eyes were basically telling me that if i did not fight him i was a coward, but as mentioned above it does not mean that i am a coward if i did not fight this piece of sht, it meant that i was saving us both time, and was not letting this insane mentally ill person let his anger out on me, because he obviouslly was walking around looking for a fight, so it would be stupid of me to let him get his wish, because i obviouslly do not deserve to get hit in the face by someone for no reason at all, he basically was looking for a punching bag to let his anger out. but the thing is that he would never get rid of his anger, or maybe he would. but knowing all this i still cannot sleep at night because that situation made me completely lose control over my life, because it means that whenever someone like him will want to physically dominate me they could and would and there would be nothing i could do about it. with this thought racing in the back of my mind constantly obviouslly i cannot fall asleep, i feel hopeless and furious. the thing also is that i could find him online and talk sht to him that way, but he quit his job and left literally the next day, so i never coukd get a resolution to this situation and i never heard his name or anything like that, so that is just a person that came into my life, bullied me, and just like that left without consequences which feels depressing. i am typing this still lying in bed, i have slept only about 3 hours max i think, this is all i have been thinking about all night. ofcourse i could workout and learn how to fight to feel more confident, but these two things show only that i have been controlled by these people into putting my time into things that i do not want to do which again is super depressing. anyone should feel safe in this society whether or not they know how to defend themselves. this person that did this to me is a son of a bitch and is most likely laughing at me right now knowing how much he has impacted my life with such a minor thing, and how easily he can control the emotions of someone like me. i am depressed and furious that i did not fight a bully at work that mocked me",2

"honest. not trying whine. i literally have no one else to talk to. i really am just over it. i have two out of four of my girls that i am hanging around for. my oldest just had an attitude all the time. i get it you are 20. my 18 year old is disabled. so most of her care falls on me. totally fine with. my 17 year old is a narcissistic brat and lives with my parents in another state. my 9 year old is so young. all my kids have great qualities about each of them. my husband and i have been married 22 years this year. and he absolutely hates me i feel. i love him. but he has never been sweet to me since we got married. now i have made a mistake in our marriage, i am not perfect. neither is he. he was so mean all the time. i felt so terrible and when someone else makes you feel nice, you run towards, even if its wrong. but it has been 17 years since then. i take care of his medications. and i help where i can with appts. i take care of the kids. i work full time, crap hours. i barely function. when i ask for help i am seen as weak. i am trying to not show i am sad at all. i try to be everything to everyone. my oldest has attitude and wants to move out or whatever. i have a great job at the hospital. its the hours that kill me and give me tremendous mom guilt because i am so tired and try to get some sleep but not everything gets done. i think my co workers like me. i am such a people pleaser. its nuts. i am not trying to look for compliments. but damn i do so much for everyone, and no one gives a crap. my husband says i am lucky to even be where i am. i would have nothing if it was not for him. the only that would truly miss me is my 9 year old. because she is the heart of us. the 18 year old would be put in a home if i died. the 20 year old would be pissed but get over it. the 17 year and my parents would be like what took so long? how did she ever live past robyn? my birth mom. i am adopted by my aunt and uncle. my husbands sister, who i was so there for her when she went through cancer out of no where quit taking to me two years ago. i have not spoken to my parents since my daughter went to live with them. everyone seems to forget that i am the one they went to for everything. childcare, money, advice. so i make one mistake, and i am a piece of shit forever? no one helped me when my husband was hitting me. i actually met with my dad at a restaurant. he would not even let me and my kids come home. he said stick it out. so here i am 22 years later. i love my husband. i do sweet things to try and get affection. all i get is what i think he has a girlfriend. i honestly do not care. i just wish i was treated like a person. i work my butt off. my husband spends so much time and effort looking for records he wants to buy. on his phone!!!!! i hate smart phones so much. he is on his so much. i have mentioned before that the whole house is not on a device and no one listens. i really hate how not a single person in my life can actually be nice to me except my disabled daughter, most days. and my 9 year old. those two are the only reason i am still here. because i would rather not. there is so much more. now i know worse things happened to other people and i should not be whining about anything. thanks for taking the time to read. i do wish you a great day of sunshine so over it",2

"24f and i have been stuck in this situation for over a decade. all i want is to be happy, but my mind does not allow me to feel anything but sadness and hopelessness. i have been to countless therapists and psychiatrists, but nothing they have done has helped. i am so tired of feeling like this. i am in constant pain from a chronic illness, and i pushed everyone i love away. so i am going to go ahead and end it. i have tried so many times in the past, but i have secured enough pills to make sure i do it correctly this time. i could jump in front of a train or hang myself, but that is too inconvenient and shocking to others. this way, ill just be in my bed until somebody finds me. if you are reading this, thank you for listening. i tried",6

"i got out of an abusive relationship about three years ago. i had awful things happen to me before it, but it really was the absolute rock bottom. the man strangled me unconscious and beat me, and i wound up sleeping with a knife under my pillow, and then sleeping on the streets, constantly checking over my shoulder. but i got inpatient therapy and a network of supportive friends and i was all clear, and no contact with the guy whatsoever. i had a couple of nice flings, but after that i guess what i did was work on being alone and happy with it.",3

"looking for some good vibes hello everyone, i am writing this because i've been reading posts on this sub for the past week, since i've learned about avpd from my new therapist and researching about this disorder, as i believe i also suffer from it and have a curiosity from you people. unfortunately, not to make anyone feel bad about it, as i know this condition is very hard to live with, but i have been trying to look for some success stories from people here, or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life. so my question for you, especially maybe for the older people here with the condition,or the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of ""success"", no matter how small, what is your outlook on life? what advice do you have regarding managing this condition? although i've also had a rough couple of days, i'd like to believe that not all is bleak and that getting access to good stories from people similar to you can certainly help. please share anything you'd like that might help me and others on this sub.",4

i m don t know how to explain it but any affection make me genuinely sick to my stomach it s weird because i m a loving person i try to be kind to everyone and help a much a i can maybe sometimes a little too much even with the smallest thing i try to come through and help because something inside me genuinely just say i should do it i can never respond correctly to any compliment and always try to find a way move around it or i just quickly think of a way to compliment them back so it doesn t feel one sided is that weird the only time i don t feel a way about it is when my mom dad or sister compliment me i try to interact with people but feel like they genuinely don t care about what i have to say and a lot of the time i don t know if it s in my head or if it s true when i get invited to meet i want to say something but never do and kind of just stay there silent listening a lot of the time i feel like i make my friend super uncomfortable too i can only come up with so much to say and usually just hope there s is more than one person there when i do talk i never know what to say or stumble over my word figuring out how to say it to the point where they interrupt me to conclude the conversation or move on don t get me started with romantic stuff every time i think about being in a relationship i genuinely want to vomit i feel so sick my stomach hurt it s also terrible because i really want to be in one someone to have loving bond with a two sided support system ups and down all that good stuff sometimes i imagine it too but when i do i physically get so ill like i m gon na throw up kinda feel like i m rambling but i don t understand what all this is tldr simple affection make me feel sick or uncomfortable even though i m a person who love to make others feel great and do my best to help them all,2
"so i have been feeling this way for, well ages. after a few life changing moments a few years ago i suddenly actually want to stay. a few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. i absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. i am fighting my best fight but i have recently noticed i am slipping back into old habits. for example, i have that nagging feeling that i am just not good enough unless i work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if i do not then i am worthless and not worthy of love. i have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. a lot to unpack there but i am kind of ignoring it for now. today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. i closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then i began to list off in my head what i did and what i must have forgotten. i became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar i work at a tavern and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. it just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and i stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and i never stay after for a drink because i feel so uncomfortable in social situations. i was close to tears as i hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. am i taking his outburst as validation for how awful i already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? me forgetting something at closing when i am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now i never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. i just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time i clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. i want to never have to clock in again. i am terrified. need help navigating uncertainty",2
"this is going to be kind of long..i am sorry.. oh boy here we go, so its super late, 4 am, this is not the first night i have posted here, its kind of embarrassing for me to post my emotions online but, i am kind of anonymous here so i guess its fine, i am not sure what is wrong with me anymore, its like everything goes fine and dandy and then...bam just anger and sadness and just so much bs. i do not want to be alone yet that is all i really ever am, i can act fine for my family and even for my friends and lover, but at the end if the day, i lay in my bed wishing and hoping that i do not wake up the next day. i do not want to say i am suicidal but i am, and that is just something i have to face. but i do not want to? idk its all so confusing and i can never ever talk to anyone about this not even my close friends. so many rely on me to be a place of support and help and yet, they only ever talk to me when they are depressed or suicidal and like ugh! i have to save everyone! while i am not getting saved, i soak everthing up like a spondge and i want it to all stop! i keep thinking ""oh everythings great!"" well its not, no one talks to me anymore only my lover, who is wonderful and amazing but just i cannot talk to him about this! not because anything he does its just humiliating...talking to strangers feels better i do not know why. but i did something awful...i think i know why no one wants to speak with me anymore, i stopped trying to give good advice i just listen ""mhm"" ""well what do you think you should do?"" hoping they would be able to solve their own issues without needing me! but i realized that just made it seem like i did not care...i do! i just want my friends to grow and learn that they do not need me to make their own choices...but i am too stupid to make it seem that way. but enough of that...i feel so alone. my thoughts are cluttering together and its all too much. i just want to sleep and stay asleep until my life ends. i do not want to be here. but i have no choice because ""i have to live"" i wish so desperately to die of natural causes and freak accidents, i do not even care how it happens just make it seem like i tried to live so my family does not get too hurt by it. i have attempted suicide befote when i was little, i am still a kid, but more mature? that sounds so egotistical ""hah wow look at me i am sooo mature now!"" i am really not. i remember the way things use to feel, it was always a brick wall on my chest, and my head felt hallow and empty, same with my body. now its just confusing and it hurts, its like a roller coaster of stupid emotions. my mother is not around to listen to this, my father and i have a relationship were we do not talk about serious stuff, i am too proud to talk about this to anyone i know and its just like i am trapped in a never ending cycle of sadness. i want my happiness to come back but i cannot even remember what it felt like, was it ever really there? it had to be right? i sound like i did years ago, edgy and sad and ew it was just gross. i was gross. i am not sure what i am going to so now but i guess i will try and sleep, i have work tmr. goodnight thanks for listening to my boring ramble just ranting on the internet do not mind me",6

"advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post i ve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life. i was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. at the end of those 6 months i started to get dizzy more often amp have what i can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but i just did not feel in control of my emotions and i felt like i was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed. so i got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months i started to feel average at best but better than before. august 2022 i started to get brain zaps dizziness every day for over a month so i went to a new psychiatrist and got back on zoloft 50 mg to start. i worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better, but in december my dad died and i was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. i went up to 100 mg around feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. very dizzy, lots of anxiety amp panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. it gets a lot worse at night and that s when most of my issues arise. within the last 6 months i ve seen an ear doctor to make sure i didn t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam i got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone computer or reading , and i got an mri done and saw a neurologist. all has always come back normal so i m thinking it s a medication issue or lack of something. i m mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since i m not doing well lol. thanks for reading",0

"uncontrollable hiv anxiety new to reddit so i apologise if this post is a little all over the place! so i've struggled forever with anxiety. i'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which i think has contributed to it. over the past 3 weeks i have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that i have hiv. i've been diagnosed with ocd and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that i'm on deaths door after panickingly googling symptoms. so basically i met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. then, very out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together every kind of sex, for those interested . i barely remember it and the next day i knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and i asked if he 'had anything'. he said no, and seemed pretty offended. well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when i said i thought he had hiv and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? where do you have them done? how many people have you slept with? i physically couldn't eat for days, and i spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. i was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. in the end i spent 5 hours waiting in a amp e until 1am to get pep. i had to exaggerate to get it the guys parent's are ghanaian and nigerian, he was born in cuba, but i said he was ghanaian because i know there's a high rate there . i remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and i just started crying. i was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point. the guy in question has been so lovely. he knew how anxious i was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. i'm currently taking pep. all my friends think it's hilarious how anxious i am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. i can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. i'll think things like, what if i've actually got it from a previous partner? this guy has tattoos, would they test for hiv before that? what if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before i find out the truth? i had a blood test done at the end of january which was clear, and my blood test from a amp e was fine, and i tested negative for everything except a water infection. even then i was thinking what if the water infection is the start? i sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. i see a spot on my body and i'm convinced that is the rash starting. does anyone else suffer with this? i'm scared that even if i get a negative result that my anxiety will continue.",0

"i am a 27m, pansexual, and autistic. growing up, i was bullied alot, but i can recall having happy moments, even happy moments with my mother, but as i grew, my mother and i started to become more argumentative and hostile, and drastically effected my mental standing. everyday was mental struggle to find happiness, and i would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime, and it helped me ignore it, but then came the dark day, an argument so drastic, that i had to kick myself out, to my wife's girlfriend then house. for awhile, i felt great! my mother's hostility felt like the moon from legend of zelda majora's mask, and leaving finally made it disappear. come present day, my anxiety had risen, things are harder to enjoy, and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where i cannot have a day with out hearing my mother's voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screw-ups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife who battles against depression, and is possibly autistic . i feeling like i am losing the war for my mind, and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again constantly creep up. this has spiraled into beast that just will not die. i do not know what to do, and i have come here as a start, because idea how to ask for help, and have actively avoided looking for help because i am too ashamed the root of a losing war",2

"i 26m am having a lot of difficulties finding happiness in life. my father was an artist and a violent alcoholic. i tried to learn art to impress him, thinking he would choose me over drinking. that did not happen, his drinking and abuse got worse, and i think i experienced fight-or-flight almost daily during my formative years. my parents separated when i was 11 and he died when i was 18.nowadays i have no self-esteem whatsoever and i experience extreme anhedonia that is only alleviated when i am romantically desired by someone. i am always fine at first after a breakup, but when i am single and experiencing only rejections for a few months it starts to feel like i am lying to myself. i have been trying to make myself more desirable by working out, practicing yoga, writing music, etc. i also realized i was a massive doormat, being whatever i thought my partner wanted me to be and agreeing to everything. i think both the doormat behavior and the need to be attractive are symptoms of my abandonment issues and the need to protect myself by controlling others.i understand i need to let go of control, but i am not sure how. i think when i am condensed to a bio and a few photos on a dating app i should sell well 6'5, beard, hiker, yogi, musician, engineer, building a startup in my free time, funny, good listener, etc. but when i try to be authentic i see no success. the only ways i ever feel anything that even approximates being wanted is by settling for women who do not like me for me. i am a huge metalhead, a fantasy nerd, and in touch with my emotions and almost every woman i meet treats those as negatives.i feel like i have two choices enter a bad often abusive situation but suspend the anhedonia and become able to progress again. set healthy boundaries, realize that even the most basic boundaries eliminate every potential partner, and watch the life i built up crumble due to depression.i understand that to break out of this dilemma i need to be able to reject women who are not good to me, and for that i need to be happy when i am single. the problem is that i am doing all the things i love, quite literally running out of ideas on how to make myself happier, and it makes me feel nothing. the more i do the things i love the more i convince myself nothing will ever be enough. do you have any advice on controlling the anhedonia so my single life feels worth living?ps i have got a lot of problems with my inner voice being incredibly critical of me. lately it has been feeding me all kinds of hypotheses to try and explain my failures. i figured that attractive people are desired by everyone so they are spoiled for choice and start putting the interested into three categories those they would actually date, those they would use, and those they would not even bother using. for men that use looks like hiding their true intentions to have sex with women they do not view as their peers, and for women that use looks like getting free dinners and fancy gifts from men they do not view as their peers. i figured i am only good enough to be used by the users, and the genuine women out there who do not use people simply do not find me dateable at all. i thought the way to fix this was to get hotter but now i am really anxious about what i will do when i have a six pack and nothing changed. i was wondering if you could explain why i am wrong so i can get that inner voice to shut up? i do not want to fall into misogyny, but i feel like i cannot come up with any counterarguments to convince myself otherwise. how do i overcome anhedonia without a romantic relationship?",2
"you have to be twice as good as them to get half of what they have. i sometimes wonder, how different my life would have been, if i was a little bit luckier? it feels like, if you want to beat this thing, in some sense you need to be ""twice as good as them to get half of what they have"". life feels like a video game. most of us play it on a hard difficulty, and we are wondering why are we so far behind other people. most people are the way they are because they are that way, not because they chose and worked hard to be that way. do you think, outgoing, social type of person chose to be that way? maybe in some cases. but more likely than not it wasn't his choice what made him that type of person. but rather circumstances outside of his control things like parenting, lack of trauma, genetics . i don't know if i ever going to beat it. and if i don't beat it, maybe i shouldn't blame myself.",4

"why do i feel off numb i had gone through a lot in the past 2 years, facing a horrible dispute with my parents mom,stepdad,and dad and being thrown into a mental hospital after a school got scared of me. my parents destroyed my relationship with my ex and my social life, making me mentally snap or something. afterwards, then figuring my dad had manipulated me and ridding of him from my life. i took lots of drugs i wasn t supposed to take after everything that had happened and nothing afterwards has been the same. i had realized i no longer was happy about the things that made me happy, rather emotionless. this occurred after me getting out of the mental hospital , furthering getting worse after a cycle of rad-140 with mk677 and a benadryl overdose of 1200mg in the span of two days. i have a new relationship, life, no more problems it seems like, but i feel no joy and no happiness towards my daily actions and accomplishments as well as interactions with other people. i go through my day seeing my current girlfriend and friends or getting something done but never feel completed, like i did something but forgot cause i just did it to do something. i also recognized how much i had dissociated, it felt like all i think about is the wrong and past because it s what i can t fix that was clearly my fault at some times. i think too much about what people have done to me, making me stay away and never invite people over. i often blur out and feel as if i m in my own world where nothing exist for seconds up to hours, even sometimes forgetting who was talking to me or what i was doing. i feel insane, i have extremely bad mood swings. no i never was diagnosed with any sort of mood disorder, but i was on abilify because of alleged homicidal ideations. i have extreme anger, enough to cause myself and others harm. i do not have any explanation to why i have these feelings and want an explanation. i have cut myself before because of the anger towards myself and others and don t want to be in the same place. i have had unexplained episodes before that felt descriptive to being manic episodes but never fully closed to be, just because they said it was the mood stabilizers that caused it. the last time i felt homicidal ideations was unintentional and was two weeks ago. i started to stop caring about everything. problems i had, my grades, my girlfriend, my ex, my goldfish and my dog it didn t matter. every problem was the same because i felt as if nothing could feel as close as painful as the things i heard and saw from the past 2 years specially and even further in the past with trauma. i would be in near death situations even with drugs with almost dying from multiple overdoses, with the worst being benadryl. i miraculously have woken up every time just glad i had experienced something out of worldly and disconnected more than actually caring that i almost died. the benadryl overdose itself, actually made this affect worse. after two weeks and a half of recovery from it, i felt so disassociated and had no feelings towards anything in a bad or negative way similar to what i was talking about earlier but worse, making me stop caring about everything. somewhat it wasn t the worst, considering the days that would viewed the worst by others was just another day for me just like the rest. random thoughts of apologizing, being empathetic, but then being hateful and sad and homicidal. also sort of like mood swings, it s just an array of unexplained thoughts that never get told to the people i m thinking about or anyone actually. and example of this goes as such, i will feel happy i had feelings towards someone and remember what they ve done but then feel extreme opposite feeling such as pain,anger,fear,sadness, and homicidal ideations. i had these feelings and still do as they can happen anywhere, i ve had them for years in-fact. do they mean anything? thank you for your time and efforts of reading my post. if you have any explanation to why these things and happening and what they are, feel free to comment whatever you d like to.",2

"is my 30s f anxiety screwing with me or am i correctly interpreting that this woman 30s f is not interested in being friends with me? i'm 30s f feeling hurt by this interaction with a friend of a friend also 30s f who i thought might want to be friends with me but evidently doesn't and need help processing it some feedback on it. on top of my social anxiety, i have other anxiety disorders, depression and am possibly on the spectrum so socializing is extra extra hard for me and i really am lacking in friends. here's the situation july 2019 was at a friend's wedding out of state and met one of her other friends who lives in my state, about 30-40 min away from me. we hit it off and she said she's always looking for new friends and it would be cool to grab dinner sometime. dec 2019 i never hear from her and reach out to find out about dinner and we schedule something, but end up canceling because she has a family emergency. feb 2020 i check in about how she's doing, if she still wants to do dinner, and we schedule a dinner. our mutual friend happens to be in town so it ends up the three of us at dinner together. july 2020 pandemic is happening. she includes me on an email invite to her bday party at her house. i don't feel comfortable going so decline. june 2021 i am feeling lonely and reach out to find out how she's doing and if she'd like to go to this outdoor concert with me. she ends up not being able to make it that day, but says we should one day meet up for dinner and i agree. i remind her we had talked about some greek place that time we went out and she says ""yeah, let's do dinner soon."" september 2021 never heard from her about dinner and reach out again. she says her next two months of weekends are booked with fall activities with friends. she mentions a few she's doing that i could join. i tell her i'd be interested in this farm visit she's doing. she tells me it'll probably be some weekend in oct, but she'll let me know the details once it gets closer and she and her friends decide the exact day. i never hear anything. march 2023 now get a random text from her asking how i'm doing. i get excited thinking she's interested in reconnecting. i'm feeling extra depressed and lonely and friendless as more friends have moved away lost touch. she asks if i still live where i used to and if i still work remote. yes and yes. i ask how she's doing, but she's vague only telling me she saw another friend of our mutual friend recently and that she still lives in the same town. then, she says the reason she is reaching out to me is because she has a friend who is single and she thought of me. she sends me all his details and asks if i was interested. man, did i get so depressed! i thought she had been interested in reconnecting because she was interested in a friendship with me and regrets we never ended up hanging out again. i kept expecting her to suggest we meet up or something, but it turns out she is only interested in me for a potential date for her friend. i feel hurt that here's someone i wanted to be friends with who i for the hundredth time thought might want to be friends with me and i again feel rejected. i know i could once again ask if this woman wants to grab dinner for the 1000th time , but i feel ridiculous at this point and like a loser. she clearly is not interested in hanging out with me or i wouldn't have had to be the one to reach out to her every time and she would have followed up on those details about the farm visit back in 2021 that she did go on. what do you all make of all of this? tl dr heard from someone who i had been previously trying to befriend for the first time in nearly 2 years. thought she was interested in the friendship, but really reached for another reason. made multiple attempts in the past to hang out with no result and feel like a loser trying again. can't tell if she really is disinterested in friendship or if my anxiety etc is skewing things.",0

"context for this post is that i have struggled with depression for most of my life. i was not in a position to do anything about it before, up until very recently, because it was never just the only problems i had going on. there was always some other serious issue slammed into eight other things that i had to work my way around every day in order to actually function. a lot has happened these past two years. i have stabler relationships, i have friends who i like i just cannot really talk to them about any of these issues because they have never experienced long lasting significant mental health issues and have personally told me that while they are here for me, they do not understand and have no frame of reference to understand what i am going through . most of the things that i have had to deal with these past six or seven years- extreme mood swings, crushing apathy towards anything, loss of interest in activities and eating etc. have mostly died down into what i would call normal levels that almost everyone experiences in their life. they are manageable i guess for lack of better words. the only downside was that it meant that the week long sometimes even months long depressive episodes and sudden onsets of debilitating depression its just depression in it is severe bland dictionary meaning. severe feelings of despondency and despair. i do not have any other way of explaining it have gone from being pushed to the side lines in order to deal with other stuff, to front and centre of my life now. i cry on the commute back and forth between my classes. two weeks ago the feelings of depression that i would been crushing down all week suddenly peaked and i skipped my last two classes because i genuinely did not feel up to it mentally or able to concentrate or focus because of how bad i felt and how depressed i was. i wish i was exaggerating in order to make a coherent and simple case of 'yeah here is proof that i have debilitation depression that affects my life 24 7' but i am not, when i say that every day i have to fight down the majority of me that goes 'avoid your friends hide out in the bathrooms during intervals and breaks until you are normal and capable of human interaction again' even if i know in my head that being around my friends will make me feel better and that seeing them will remind me that no matter how stupid things are for me mentally right now that they are there. sometimes i win and sometimes i do not. it feels like an uphill battle where none of the lessons i learn being with friends is good. do not isolate yourself get retained or remembered through idk brain muscle memory or anything. this is the best that i have been in years, if only because i have managed to keep it at a 'one step forward two steps back herculean effort to take another one step forward to balance things again' cycle. but i know its only going to get harder and more intense for me at school next year because of the increase in workload and just the general insanity of stress and uni applications and important exams that determine your future and decisions that i am making this year that are supposed to be plans for the next five years of my life. right now feels like the only opportunity i will have to take some kind of action medication lmao and get used to all the side effects, while the academic stakes are still relatively manageable even if it makes me cry sometimes. i guess for me it was always the money that made feel about getting diagnosed and the leftover remains of when i was more seriously mentally ill being alive is a waste of money complex hahaha . the counsellor i have been seeing for the past three or something years tried to broach the topic of possible diagnosis for depression just in my opinion it mgiht be wrong just let me say my opinion and you can disagree this is based off of what i know from seeing you semi regularly for these last few years two weeks ago same day i missed those last two classes lmao but i shot them down because there is really no pathway after getting diagnosed, at least not for me, that does not end in medication. i have been friends with a few people who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder among other depression disorders, all of which took medication. we have fallen out of contact due to the past year of lockdown and pandemic etc but i still remember talking to them about the side effects of medication and whether it was really worth it because they were still in pain they were still struggling even on medication. talking to them made me realize that they were right and that it could only get worse if treatment was not taken. some potentially severe side effects are worth not feeling like hell and being obstructed by your own mind every day of your life. the only issue is my parents, who despite knowing almost zero if not absolutely nothing about depression and other mental health issues genuine quote from one of them was 'i know nothing about this and i do not understand and i do not need you to explain it to me. medication has terrible side effects that will ruin your life yet still manage to have hardline anti-medication, for lack of better words, views because of their percieved horrific life ruining side effects. is medication worth it despite the side effects?",2

"i can't stop thinking and i need to vent!! hi reddit, i'm here to vent about my stress, and honestly, i have no one to talk to. i am f 23 , and last year i started my first ""big girl job"" as a copywriter in marketing. i originally studied filmmaking to be a screenwriter or producer, anything to get me to be on set. my love and passion for being behind the scenes and seeing the projects come to life are breathtaking. i enjoy talking to the cast, getting behind the camera, and being transported to a different unique world. so why was my first big job in marketing? during the pandemic, my concern was how to get myself out there when i was very limited in making connections and unable to go out and shoot because of social distancing measures due to the pandemic. the school i was in offered an internship for a class in marketing, and i took it honestly, anything to make my portfolio and resume look good . not going to lie the internship was fun and exciting, so when they offered me an entry-level position in marketing, i was hesitant. i didn't study marketing or advertising or anything related to that, just filmmaking. they knew that i only had knowledge of film but still wanted to give me a chance to explore my career options. now, having been here for a year, i've built up an extreme amount of stress. every single day i am constantly feeling stressed, anxious, and depressed. i'm always messing up, and it has gotten to the point where i received a pip. i saw it coming. i am struggling with my grammar, not being strong enough when it comes to presenting, and lacking creativity. things are so rushed here that i often miss a thing or two, which reflects poorly on me. being dyslexic doesn't help either. as a result, i received a pip, and it has spiked my stress levels and anxiety to the point where i feel sick every day. i can't eat, don't feel like getting out of bed, can't breathe, can't sleep, and can't think clearly. additionally, i have been struggling with a yeast infection for six months yes, you read that right . my doctor says i have a candida overgrowth, so i am on a strict diet in hopes of getting it under control. the whole experience is making me feel like a failure, like i've made a big joke out of myself. my manager talked to me and said that copywriting marketing isn't for me because i didn't learn it, and he knows my skills lie elsewhere. i agree, but i am afraid i won't find a job in film with how the economy is and the difficult hiring process i see on social media. it's terrifying. how am i going to pay for school, debt, help my parents, pay for groceries for this stupid candida diet, and help my grandma in mexico, and more bills? my parents and a coworker of mine are giving me words of encouragement and saying that everything is going to be okay. they say i should still be proud because i tried something new, created a new set of skills, and toughened up. i don't know if that's true.",5

"there were rules to which obeyed, standarts...living in a charade thy was all. no real purpose can save you when you are mentally ill. i have ocd non responsive to meds. everday i lose a part of my identity. constant fight beetween two spheres of my brain. i was a star dust and i am ready and fulfilled in life to go back to where everthing started. i love my friend yamur which is a mix of passion and love and charity. i can do anything for her if i had been healthy enough.i love my family too they matter a lot. but i can not tolerate my daily melancholic suicidal depression and obsessions just for the sake of them. the world has no rules on grand scale no justice no purpose. we have to distract our mind and create and illusion each second just to forget we exist. yes we exist and this must be a bad joke. we are walking to the eventual death of us each day. some of us only suffer while some of us can be happy in their distraction.for example the girl i loved we are texting only ilove her so much without even seeing her face and voice. yet i know she will never meet with me nor can i touch her ever. on top of that void calls me. i always dreamt of jumping from bosphurus bridge. before jumping i ll look to mu childhood photos family photos and the photos of the girl i deeply fell love in. i do not want to lose and tarnish this love. call me coward probably right. anyway sleeping pills and jumping from bosphurus to crystsl blue current will be my choice. maybe the only time i would be free just before dying. such a misery. i will become a part of eternal silence until maybe i revorn again after for example another big bang. or maybe never who knows maybe we a simulation of a 4th grade student out of our real . and some day our universr will cease to exist to no avail.i want to thanks to reddit which is full of nice and also weird people. people who shows their true selves.i love you yamur and it ll be forever.and my family do not morn after me for finally am i free.in another life brothers bye. my suicide note was just a passenger",2
"on therapy my therapist is very talented. in fact, she was booked for the entire month of december and for all but the last week of this month. that means it'll be almost two months between appointments, when i'm used to seeing her twice a month. this has never happened in our quite lengthy time together, and i'm scheduled through march from here on out. therapy is an interesting thing for me. because i come from a very traumatic background, therapy has been a godsend for ptsd-related issues. what i'd never noticed before, though, is how much it helps me regulate my mood in between sessions. knowing i'll have someone to help me sort through random thoughts and make sense of any major shifts or psychotic issues allows me to keep the jumble in the background. it's like static i can tolerate the static when i know there will eventually be someone who can help me understand how the radio works. bad example but best i can do. my therapist, pdoc, and i constantly assess whether therapy is beneficial to me, because it has been ongoing for quite some time. we were all of the understanding that, yes, in fact, i get a great deal of benefit from therapy. now i'm one month into not having therapy, and things are falling absolutely apart. suspicion confirmed. i will go on through this month doing the best i can, and i will try not to break any more aspects of life. then, i will spend a couple of sessions picking up the pieces and hoping this sort of break in our therapy journey does not happen again anytime soon.",1

"almost a year ago the company i work at shut down the building and moved everyone to working remotely. i was hesitant about it then and at this point i am just completely falling apart. my workspace is just feet from where i sleep at night and it has to be there . i wake up in the morning next to my sleeping wife, roll out of bed, put on a pair of shorts, and clock in for the day. i do not get to see any of the friends i made at the office. i do not get to talk shit about corporate over a cup of coffee. i do not get to take a slow drive at night before i get home and destress myself before i get home. i am spiraling into a deep depression, my work stats are falling tremendously, and my attendance is flatlining but i do not feel i have any other options. two years ago i was a career factory worker, working with high school friends at the local cheese factory, and i loved it. but it ended suddenly when i was in a life changing car accident and shattered half of my spine. i could no longer do any sort of labor standing work and had to move to the city to find a desk job. the company i worked at was the only one who would hire a crippled factory worker with no customer service experience at the age of 20. they provided me with an orthapedic chair, a comfortable job, and secure source of income. working in the building also gave me the social interaction i needed to make new friends here in a city i would never seen before. but then covid happened. well over half our workforce jumped on the chance to work from home rather than on site but more than a few of us wanted to remain in the office and so we did, until corporate decided for us. they decided it was no-longer financially viable to keep the office building open and announced we had a month to vacate and be set up to work from our homes. so i moved all my stuff onto a cart and shoved it into the back of my volkswagen. i got it home, put it on an old desk i had left in storage, set up some filing cabinets, and put my usual desk toys on it. at first i was enjoying amenities readily available to me by being in my own house. i knew the bathroom would be empty anytime i needed it, i could brew my own pot of coffee, and i have shelves and a fridge with snacks and meals loaded up in them. if i got to bored i could play with my dogs or turn on the tv behind me and play my old xbox 360 on mute. but i knew it was lacking something major. no longer could i take off my headset and go storm outside after a shitty customer encounter and vent to a coworker doing the same while sucking down 3 cigarettes in record time. i could not take my foam football and play catch with my cubicle neighbors anymore. i could not start up a conversation with my boss where we picked apart all the issues we had with ""the hobbit"" movies. we could not leave fun little surprises on each others desks, company christmas was dead forever, and we no longer would share a meal together in the cafeteria on thanksgiving. i just finally made a single friend outside of work but i cannot force myself into his space constantly, he has 2 kids and a wife to take care of first. i cannot go to the gym and burn off energy because i will physically hurt myself, i cannot go wander in any direction with a .22 and hunt for small game in a city, and i cannot go fishing in any of the commercial use waterways around me. i feel so alone, i feel like i no longer have a bedroom but instead an office space that i sleep in. my physical health is being affected even, i am getting sick more often, my body hurts more than normal, and i just never feel like i am fully awake anymore. i do not really know what help to ask for if i am being completely honest. can anyone offer some advice, or emotional support, or even share some experience that can help me through this? working from home",2

"my depression keeps getting worse, and i want to stop pushing away the people i love. 20m i feel like im slowly decaying. my mind slips i cant remember much anymore, i have no desire to do any fun activities anymore at least not the ones that ive done already which is just about everything . i have all the desire in the world to get better, but no motivation. i can honestly feel myself getting worse each month. i noticed that i become a little more sad and unmotivated over time, and i really cant seem to stop it from progressing. it feels like a disease. my life just feels like im in limbo every day. i wake up, do the same thing all day that ive done a million times this week, then wait until my insomnia decides to let me sleep. at night i get into depressive episodes that lead to panic attacks, which fill my head with intrusive thoughts that i would never think normally. its nothing horrifying or disturbing, but they really bother me. its like the voice in my head wants me to be sad on purpose. the thought that really bugs me the most, the reason for making this post in the first place, tells me to push people away. not really in that exact manner, but i question if i can really feel anything towards the people who are close to me. everyone is normally completely fine, but not during my episode. it makes me feel like a completely different person. it makes me wonder if i really love my girlfriend and if id be better off alone. its similar for my friends. im fine with them normally, but during my episodes, they annoy me and i feel like i want to stop talking to them. but after i go to sleep and wake up, everything is back to normal. i love my girlfriend, and i like my friends. this thought didnt start happening until this month. i never used to want to push people away because ive always been the lonely type who wants more friends, and i always hated being alone, and i still do which is how i can tell that im getting worse. im just not me anymore, im a completely different person than the one i used to know. the other thoughts are just pessimistic jabs at my future, and general sadness questions. wondering if im ever going to live a stable life, or if im going to feel happy and content ever again, or if i will continue to be a failure forever. i always have to remind myself that it has to get better eventually, and i cant feel like this forever, but most times its hard to convince myself. i cant remember the last time i didnt feel terrible. im not suicidal, i dont have a desire to stop living, and dont even get thoughts about it whatsoever. but these episodes make it really difficult to be a living, functioning person. i need to know how to stop thinking this way when i start to feel hopeless. i know i probably need a therapist or psychiatrist to help me professionally, but im afraid of them.",2

"anxiety has ruined me just a vent tbh . i've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as i grow older, i feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. ironically even therapy scares me as i'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening boring them. sounds silly but i almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought on the topic of skills, i wholeheartedly believe i have 0 skills. i've always been told i'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. when i'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think i'm fishing for compliments. even then i think i just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. literally no achievement i think i really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent as well, my social skills are horrendous. i'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. i rely on them to start and keep convos going cause i'm just so boring and unfunny. i have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. idk i completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. i like art but again i'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. i'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons i still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging. i'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. i'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything i've tried. heck i can't even ride a bike i couldn't list a single talent i have. anything i'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. for example i'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. there just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me my anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. i will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. i never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. i sit on the bus with my hood on so i'm not looked at. even when i briefly had a job, i couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. it was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. sweating is one of the main symptoms i experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me i can stay somewhat in peace at home but i do have struggles here and there. but obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as i fear i will completely isolate myself this way does anyone have a similar situation?",0

after a day so long it felt like forever and i barely remember the morning i question myself if it was worth living. i ask myself if it is really worth the pain to be alive to see the next morning. i think of anything i could possibly miss out on. there is usually nothing that makes me think yes i actually do want to get up tomorrow morning. tears roll down my cheeks by this point and i think another day gone and it is not gotten better. before going to sleep every night i ask myself if i really want to get up the next day and it is always no.,2

""see you in part of town i hate going to then.""it is been ten minutes since she left and she thinks i am angry because i have not texted her yet. i say no, i am in the bog i have ibs that are not going away any time soon with this stress , and that i just woke up.she scorns me saying well, i stayed up with dad last night she does not talk to him so i guess i should not either? . i am on the verge of telling her to fuck off but i do not.when i go silent she makes another snide remark. i tell her i am just trying to figure out how to get there although actually i am trying to decide if i should allow her to manipulate me into this or not. she tells me to take the bus.it is free for her. it is expensive for me.why is her depression making her selfish, short-sighted, and a bitch to me? is this common? does depression make people cruel to their loved ones",2

"does anyone here have fmla for depression? is that a thing? over time, i have discovered that working full-time really triggers my depression. i feel like it makes life pointless. like what is the purpose of working 40 hours a week just to pay your mortgage bills? then you have no time for yourself. but without the full-time job, you have no health insurance, and not enough money to do anything in your spare time. makes absolutely no sense to me. when everything was shut down during coronavirus, i felt so much better. i was even able to get off meds i had time to cook and eat well, to get proper sleep, and just to focus on and take care of myself. then i went back to work 3 days a week for about the past year and everything was still fairly good. i was managing that ok. but, i recently had to go back to working 40 hours, and the downward spiral has already begun. its only been a couple weeks, and i already feel like shit. i do not even want to get out of bed anymore working makes me depressed",2

honestly i am so damn boring. like.. its a main reason why i do not date anyone. nothing really interests me so i do not have much to talk about. i suck at all conversations and once again i am so boring. when i was a kid i had a personality i was funny and goofy and happy. now i am just a dead zombie that will laugh at things in public to not seem depressed. but my brain is so dead from depression i cannot come up with any jokes or shit. the only thing i can do is listen and barely speak which i actually hate. i want to be funny and have a personality and be desirable but i am not that. i know its depression that causes it. depression makes me so boring,2

"my boyfriend 61m bought a house as an investment 6 years ago. he rented it to me 50f and i just pay the taxes. it is an awesome house at prime location. i decided to get a roommate. a friend 47m of a friend moved in. i cut him a nice deal and this is the list of things that happened in six months. stole a case of paper towels, all of my soap, all of my spices and threw out all of my condiments. put bleach in a bottle and did not mark it. so, i destroyed two carpets including living room. broke my 1500 refrigerator my parents gave me beyond repair. damaged my 800 stove also given by parents. broke my dryer switch so it now only heats on high. turned the air conditioning down to 63. thank god it did not break. left tacks on the floor when he moved out. this is what is killing me right now. the dress and wool trench i got to wear to my brothers funeral is gone. he has female friends this month i discovered that my hat box that i kept everything from when i gave up my daughter is gone. pictures, letters and her hospital bracelet. he knew about it and saw it. i keep praying that i will find it. i hope i am wrong. i have searched everyday. she came to visit for the first time a week ago and i did not have it. my depression has been so bad that i decided to move out and we are selling the house. i cannot function enough to take care of it anymore. i will be so grateful if i am wrong but, i feel that weight of darkness coming over me again. i did not deserve this. i am absolutely gutted. cannot take much more.",2

"i thought if i post this here it may help someone who has not already heard this analogy. it is really simple but counsellors and therapists have shared this with me in the past. i think it helped me visualise how anxiety and depression affects a person's ability to function and face the challenges of life and explain it to others 1. take two cups and fill the first with a little bit of water, and the second half full.2. the first cup is a 'normal person', the second is someone who suffers with a mental health condition like anxiety, 3. for all of life's stresses - work stress, financial worries, family issues, health problems, having a bad day etc. - add a little water to each glass. do not stop pouring.4. obviously, the second glass will begin to overflow first. if it is knocked, the contents will be more likely to spill the fuller the glasses are.5. for many people who have silent struggles affecting their mental or physical health, their cup is already pretty full at their baseline.6. it does not take a lot for this cup to overflow or spill compared to others, but that does not mean the cup is completely incapable of holding any water.7. it might be necessary to make a few holes in the bottom of that cup to stop the cup from overflowing. cup analogy",2

"hi, i am new here and this is my first post. a lack of human connection crippling depression a series of unfortunate events have lead me to write this. i do not know what i want, some empathy, a community maybe. anyway, trigger warning, the post mentions blood injuries suicide.i have had depression for as long as i can recall, but for the last few months it has intensified and trapped me in ways i cannot explain. i was doing well, i had a self care routine that worked somewhat, but over the past few months things just went haywire. my mother- with whom i have a v complicated relationship had a pretty bad injury, then another and then another. so now i live in constant fear of hearing my dad shout my name from.the other room only to rush into the room to find my mother lying a pool of blood, again. for the third time. my stomach drops and heart starts pounding. the same old ensues again. they rush to the hospital i clean the mess up. i am tired of scrubbing blood. at this point i have stopped telling my friends oh it happened again because idk i do not think they would understand what cleaning up ur mother's blood does to a person. i still do not grasp it fully, i am just numb atm. 2 days ago i was withering in my bed for a solid 2 hours pleading god to kill me. that did not work.i dread taking showers because every single time i so much so as touch my hair it falls in clusters. weekly hair wash days are crucial so i go through w them but afterwards left w a sense of loss and major despair. i keep telling myself its ok everything will be okay, everything has to be okay but i do not know reallyi've got a major exam coming up, in less than a month! i get constant brain fog plus all this stress. my head hurts. i am so so heavy a crisis",2

"ok. i am not a short-winded person, so i apologize in advance for all the information i am about to dump. to make it easiertldr i need to fix my inability to be productive. a lot of it can be explained if you understand adhd and depression-induced executive dysfunction stuff. i have tried - adhd medication 36mg concerta, 20 mg ritalin or as needed - depression medication wellbutrin 150 - anxiety meds celexa 20 - therapy - adhd coaching- the just fucking do it mentality- the ignore the emotions of not wanting to do it mentality- reward systems- creating daily patterns- coworking body doubling- breaking down projects into small due dates- using project management programs- scheduling out my whole day, minute to minute- who the fuck knows what elsei am really suffering from this voice that just keeps saying but what if i do not, every time i try to implement each of these tactics. its to the point that i am not earning enough money to pay 600 of rent out of income every month. yeah. i am not earning 600 monthly. its closer to 500, which is about 10 fucking billable hours. not all of my working hours are billable, but jesus fucking christ this has to stop. the only reason i am holding on is because of past years of diligent saving. thank god for that and even so i just had to cash out an investment account to stay afloat. what the fuck do i do. my therapist keeps suggesting great ideas, and nothing is sticking. i am truly, seriously, disastrously failing. anyways, full story diagnosed with adhd at 8, medicated at 10. started on ritalin. changed to concerta at some point. switched to vyvance, which made me suicidal. no one noticed, and i did not realize it was medication related, so i was on that for two years. went back to concerta. last change to medication was in about 2014. struggled academically my whole life. even with the diagnosis i was convinced i was just too lazy to do well. i believe i am smart, but academia and i never agreed. got a degree in web development and graphic design. i honest to god love it. i love doing what i do, but even that is not enough. i do not even draw for fun anymore. all i do is listen to the same podcasts over and over again. anways. since then, finally took ahold of my mental health, got some proper diagnoses in order to start treatment. potentially relevant diagnoses avoidant and ruminative type ocd, anxiety, and depression which is the newest discovery, also should have been the first. it was a no shit sherlock kind of moment, so treatment is just beginning through therapy and wellbutrin . the obsessive compulsions create a need for absolute perfection. the ocd says, something bad will happen if everything is not perfect. and the anxiety says, but you could never anticipate every way to make something perfect, and what if its already flawed, before you even start? the depression says, not like you could ever achieve perfect, anyways, so why even bother. the adhd says, lol by the way, here is a red herring to follow, this will certainly make your work perfect if you spend 12 hours researching it, oh and by the way, here is zero serotonin for any of the work you need to do, but hey, you can have a days worth of serotonin if you keep scrolling on reddit. also let us forget to do laundry for 6 weeks, forget were putting food in our mouth for 45 minutes, and staring blankly at the floor debating about the best way to start sorting your laundry for two hours is for sure important.so i am on celexa. things go well for a while. anxiety is gone, work is good, i am making good money and enjoy what i do. inevitably, anywhere from 4-8 months after starting something new, be it a job, promotion, moving somewhere new, etc, i just stop caring. its like a fucking brick wall. and this has been true for more than a decade. new semester of school, i inevitably get straight as for the first four months, then its a race to see which makes it to 0 first the school year or my gpa. new job? i wow everyone for the first two quarters. i am participating in task forces, developing brand new systems for everyone at work, getting huge compliments from clients and coworkers alike. then, its just what if i do not? so i get fired, or i am the first person laid off because of the pandemic. now, i have this amazing thing set up. i am working for myself, which means i do not have to work full time. to make ends meet and save a little extra, i actually only need to work 20-30 hours a week. its fantastic, i love it. i get to choose my clients, i get to get out of bed at 9 instead of 7, i can go on vacation whenever i want. but the last two months have been a fucking joke. i am thankful i have amazing clients who are understanding and lenient, but i have some huge due dates coming up that i am on the verge of not having enough time to complete. i am losing clients. i am losing money. last year i made 30k in 6 months. this year, i have made about 6k. what is wrong. i am desperate. i am failing. i do not know what to do. i went on wellbutrin about a month ago. the first two days were magic. the most productive days i have had in 2021. but then the wellbutrin tapered off. i get it, medication talks need to happen with the doc, i know. its just that i am starting to think those amazing two days will not be something i can replicate. oh, and were hoping to up the adhd meds soon, but we need to wait on the wellbutrin. concerta does jack shit anymore. ritalin gives me about 45 minutes of good concentration. i cannot keep going like this. i really, seriously cannot. please hep me. i am failing because i cannot make myself care. every time i need to do something for work or life its just, but what if you do not do that? i desperately need help getting control of this.",2

"i have been treated for depression for a few years now. i expressed concerns about fatigue and brain fog to my primary care and she brought up depression. she also ran a thyroid panel because that seems like everyone is favorite test. that was normal and i was declining so i made an appointment with behavioral health. first it was zoloft even though the doctor said you have had a pretty charmed life, why are you depressed which made me feel awful for going there for help. he was retiring soon though and i was given a new provider. she added wellbutrin because i had no energy or motivation. then i started having episodes of heart palpitations tachycardia especially when i laid down to sleep. i did not feel anxious but i was told it was anxiety and was given a low dose of propranolol as needed. then vyvanse was added because my focus and energy were still horrendous. so now i am on 4 different meds, still have no energy and no focus. i have had a formal add diagnosis since undergrad. i completed a graduate degree in a stem field. but now i cannot focus on much less technical work for my job. i know this is not just add. i cannot even focus on watching tv. thank god my blood pressure was a bit high or the psych provider would have just increased the dose of vyvanse at my last appointment to try to fix my concentration issues. so this week i had my annual appointment with my primary care doctor so she will prescribe my birth control for the next year. instead of just complaining about the fatigue, random joint pain, and heart palpitations i straight up asked for lab tests. of course she repeated the thyroid panel but also added lyme, antinuclear antibodies, iron, ferritin, vitamin d, and standard cbc, lipid studies, etc. thank god the tests for lyme and autoimmune diseases came back negative. but guess what my iron and ferritin were very low. every value on the iron panel was abnormal which i am pretty sure indicates this has been going on for a while. that can because depression, palpitations, and of course extreme fatigue. my vitamin d was also low which causes depression, fatigue, and explains the random migratory bone and joint pain. i am so frustrated that this was not explored two years ago by my primary care doctor or by the psych doctors before throwing so many meds at me. i am also mad at myself for not demanding it. but even as someone that works in the medical field and is familiar and comfortable with the environment i still have a hard time standing up to physicians or telling them how to do their job.i am not saying that i do not have depression. i am almost certain i do. but i also have deficiencies that are making my symptoms so much worse and making the medications they are prescribing ineffective. and nobody ordered basic lab work to investigate why nothing was working until i asked them to. its so frustrating knowing i have felt horrible for a couple of years now and i could have easily fixed it. if any of this sounds like you please ask for the lab tests. its worth finding out if you have any underlying conditions contributing to your depression so you can be treated properly. why is an extensive panel of labs not the first step before medication? kind of a rant",2

"i failed the ib diploma. i don't want to try anymore. bd1 it's 12 29 am here. i'm so tired of trying. i tried in the ibdp, and scored 24 45 points and didn't receive my diploma. my attendance was 38 and i was in a psych ward for most of the time i wasn't there. i don't want to repeat senior year because i'm so burnt out, i just don't have another senior year in me. i can't go to university because i have no atar. i'm applying for a remark but i was three points away from passing my hl subjects so i doubt it'll do much. i can do a diploma at a university and go onto a degree in 2020, but i know it's going to tear me apart seeing my friends doing real degrees. my dream was to study in the us. i got an act score of 30. i was going to go there for real! i was so excited and proud of myself when i got that score! now, i want to go back in time and slap that stupid smile off my stupid face. i was never going to make it. i was stupid to think that i could. i have had anorexia nervosa since i was eleven years old. my bmi is around 13. every time i move my head i can feel my blood pressure doing some weird shit. i've had disordered tendencies since i was six. i do not remember a time when i was at peace with myself. i don't think i'll ever get better. i've tried so many times to heal. i'm on meds. i don't want to give up hope. there's a small part of me that wants to keep going. i really do want to be able to do a degree someday, move out of home, maybe even find love. god, i'm so lonely. i have friends, sure. but i want to experience love. it seems like it's useless to pursue that - 90 of relationships involving an individual with bipolar end in divorce. i imagine that this is higher for those with bd1. but i have so much love to give. i was in a relationship until a few weeks ago, but she was emotionally abusive. i can never get better and find love, because my body is disgusting. i'm very short - 5'6"" and female. i'm the shortest in my family by four inches. i'm around 36 kilograms, and i only look normal. i once weight restored to the still unhealthy for my height 46kg and i was hideous. i looked overweight. i can never get better from my ed if i ever want anyone to love me. i don't know. just a little rant. i'm tired of trying to get better when it seems like there is no hope for me. just this past week, i had 7 straight days of eating over 2000 calories. this was a big deal for me. i really thought i could get better. but today i freaked out and ate nothing because i saw how fat i had gotten in only one week. i need advice. what do i even do? my new psychiatrist doesn't think i'm sick enough to see me more than once every three weeks. my old one went to jail, but he cared and he saw me once a week. he went under for getting caught cooking morphine, but he was always lovely to me and genuinely cared. this one doesn't really think i'm sick enough to be seen more often. although, if i ask, i will probably be able to go inpatient in the private hospital she works at. a friend of mine also bd1 went ip there and found it very helpful, but he's much older than me and i don't know what it was like in his ward as i was down the hall in the eating disorder program. which i was kicked out of after four days had panic attack and lit a cigarette in my room . so. what should i do about treatment? i have the option to go for bd or my anorexia, but i don't do well with other anorexics around as they trigger me. i also have all the group thought experiments exercises not sure how to call them from the eating disorder unit, as i got friends who've stayed there to send them to me. in theory i could complete them in my own time if i were to go for bd and stay in that ward instead of the eating disorder ward. however, i do think that some of the things i didn't experience during my time in that ward takeaway nights, eating in public challenges, etc may have really helped me. so i'm fairly certain i will go inpatient, but not sure which ward to go to. also, what should i do about my education? should i just try to get over myself and do a diploma here, then review my options for university be that domestic or abroad when that's finished or wait and see what happens with the remark or resit my exams? this got long, i'm sorry. i skipped meds yesterday morning and last night. but i just really need some help. i'm so tired.",1
"i am just so over being alive. i used to cry about it, but now i just feel like i am just existing with no actual purpose. i do not want to kill myself but i also do not want to keep living this life. every morning when i wake up i just think damn, another day and then go about the rest of my day just wanting to scream constantly. i do not know how people put up with this shit. or experience any amount of joy at all. everyday. its exhausting. i feel like i do so much to try and make myself happy. i buy myself something nice every now and then. take myself to nice meals. got a dog who i love, but does not really change my mood . i literally just moved across the country because i thought it would make me happier to be near my siblings and closer to friends from college, but so far its just making everything worse. i hate it here. and i have tried explaining this to friends and my therapist and all they say is to get out there, see what life has to offer. i am in my mid 20s but i feel like i have already seen enough. i know there is more but i do not want to wait around for it. literally nothing in my life to this point has made me happy and i have felt this way for as long as i can remember. i want to fall in love with being alive, but i feel like i have to actually enjoy life first, which literally feels impossible. i keep calling this my slump, but maybe it cannot be a slump if i have literally always felt this way. i just do not know what to do, but i am so tired of dealing with it. there is nothing i hate more than being alive",2

"i am 23, unemployed and living at home with my mother. me and my mum barely speak language barrier so i usually spend all day in isolation. this girl i was speaking to has not replied to my messages for a few weeks now, and that is makes me feel pretty shit. i try not to think about it but it is hard. i have gained loads of weight on antipsychotics and feel unlovable.there is a river near me and loads of loose bricks in our garden, so i have been thinking i might fill up my backpack with bricks and go jump in that river some time. antipsychotics are horrible, i do not feel any emotions and sleep for around 12 hours a day. i do not feel sad really but i do not feel any joy either. i really want to leave my family home and move out to live on my own, but my entire family is worried i will end up in a psych ward again. i tried therapy late last year which was good. helped me to shift some feelings of guilt and shame for some stuff i did when i was younger, and that is no longer causing me grief now. but i just do not feel anything anymore. i hope it is just the side effect of being on aps because i am tapering off them now. i might just hold out until they are out of my system. i hope i can lose some of the weight i have put on. i just generally feel like life is not worth living. nothing's exciting, interesting or rewarding. life already kind of feels like it is ended. i have finished university and now my family expects me to stay in our hometown. i do not want to do that, i want to love life like i have fleetingly in the past. i think about that river most nights and it seems like a pretty foolproof plan. if i do die, people will only miss the past version of me that was energetic and charismatic, not this lump i am now. i feel like a stain that will not go away. i am not good enough anymore. i used to be attractive and funny and now i am just big and slow. death cannot come soon enough. a message to the world if i go ahead with it. keep chasing your gut instincts and live life for you and no-one else. believe in yourself. life becomes easy if you do all the difficult stuff first. normalise saying ""i love you"" more often, even to friends. stop sometimes and really look - it is all perfect. antipsychotics rant",6

"overthinking and feeling powerless in social situations social situations are nerve wracking because they are unpredictable and i have to come up with responses on the spot. there is also the pressure of the other party potentially manipulating you such as in business situations, or when someone is trying to sell something to you. so before these situations i often try to play out all the different paths that the interaction could take place and try to prepare everything for it. this makes each social interaction extremely high effort for little reward in comparison. there are also worst possible outcomes in which there is no way to prepare for and where there is nothing you can do about it. for example, suppose i was buying something from a shop, i hand over my money, and then the shop keeper just ignores me, what can i actually do in that situation? call the cops? get a lawyer? what proof do i have that the money was mine and i handed it over? what obliges the shop keeper to give me the item i wanted? normal people never question these dynamics and just put trust in the systems set in place, they've never been burned by it so it just works for them. but here i am worrying over every little thing that i'd rather hide away from it all if possible.",4

"i feel sick for days on end because i do not eat enough and all i can do is lay in bed and listen to my stomach and smell the dirty dishes in the sink and think about how i have not washed my hair in days and feel more and more sick until i just go back to sleep to shut it all out. i do not feel sad, i just feel sick and exhausted and disinterested. i used to do so much like art and guitar and hikes when i was a teenager but now my interests just sit across the room from me collecting dust. on days i work i manage to get more done unless i just end up going to bed around 7pm when i get home. but usually i will have random bursts of motivation which will allow me to do cleaning and some hygienic things. it is so embarrassing because when my boyfriend gets home he just sees me laying in bed still at 5 or 6pm and he has to go do things and i have spent the day thinking maybe i will be able to drag myself out of bed if we can just go out and do something. but of course he is usually busy and even when we go do things i always come back here and feel like i just want to sleep. he helps do chores when i do not do them but i cannot expect him to pick it all up for me. and i am sitting here thinking i need to get my shit together. how can he be attracted to someone like this. how can i show up at my parent's house looking great and convincing them my life is going so well, just to go home and lay in bed again, and think about how my body is only going to deteriorate more the longer i lay here. i know i will not get my shit together though. it is weird to have people call you admirable and capable just because you have a half decent job or a degree but inside you do not feel like really anything half memorable or interesting. just because i can read into what people are saying, or like to learn a lot, does not really mean i am any different from anyone else, and at the end of my life my interests will not actually mean anything or make a difference, because we kind of just live and then die, and that is it. i have health conditions that also make functioning just hard for me, pots and structural issues. makes it hard to walk around sometimes, to just get up, to stay active and feel full of energy. and i do not think my emotions are too related to that, it just combines into a larger hurdle for me to overcome.i dunno. i do not feel a lot. it is the fact that i do not feel a lot, and when i do i sob like a child and my heart feels like it is about to explode, and then i go back into this numb, hungry sleep until the next time i am alive enough to feel pain again. this is rambly and borders on nonsensical but i am just saying what i am thinking. i certainly talk to some people in my life about my feelings but all that is done is made me realize i sound like a broken record, and after a point they do not need to ask why i am crying or why i bailed on all of the plans, because they have heard it about a million times. breaking out of the cycle feels impossible",2

"i am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. i am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although i have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, i just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. when i was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that i am getting older i am beginning to feel i may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.the thing is, i am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. once the initial excitement wears off, i go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and i can sense my masculine essence eroding. i can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. i do not blame them. i do not want them to carry any of my burdens. i want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. but with each passing relationship, i just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.on top of it all, i seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. i am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, i have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although i have tried, i just do not look good completely bald and i have been told as much by friends. i legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. i even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.my last partner recently left me after i became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because i actually did care about her. but somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. the thing is, i am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. i do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and i am tired of superficial connections.i know i need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time i wake up before i try to find someone again, but the thing is i am also very lost and lack direction in life. the only thing i am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. besides that, i am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry two semesters left , but i have no desire to go to grad school or med school, and the job prospects with a b.s. in that field look bleak.are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? if so, how did you manage? i do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and i do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. thank you for reading. dating as a man with depression",2

"so it appears that it is pretty much over for me. i am a 24 year old male, living with my mother, unemployed, no girlfriend and almost no social life. i am a little chubby 30lbs or so overweight , but other than that i look fine. i have a bachelor's degree in physics and now i am entering my final year as a master's student in solid state physics. it seems that i simply cannot get a job and do something with my life. no one wants to hire me, not even for jobs for which i am overqualified. i feel terribly lonely and nothing seems to work. i feel that my chances of getting out of this situation are getting slimmer every day. i may have to make peace with the idea that i will be unemployed and a loser for the rest of my life. i do not know what to do. people keep telling me that things will get better in time, but so far, it seems that time only made things worse. i am considering a 7 day water and electrolytes fast since i have done it before and i have plenty of body fat to lose and it is rather safe in my case. maybe the fast will also bring some mental clarity. i do not know if i am actually depressed since i am willing to at least try to change my situation, but it feels like if i do not get my life sorted out soon enough, i may get depressed for real and that kind of scares me because at that point, i will have no motivation left to actually do anything. i thought maybe some of you could help me with some advice or anything. 24 year old loser",2

i'm so tired of being bipolar for the medication factor alone. i try to refill and stay on my medication but there's always an issue between cvs and my drs.office regarding some of my medications. the dr office will say i have a refill in and then i'll go to cvs and they will say it's awaiting prescriber response and it can only be refilled with the drs approval. it's depakote then i call back the dr and they say no it's in there but they will call and nothing ever gets done. this has resulted in me multiple times being out of my medication when i need it overnight and now i'm up at 4 am. listen i have to work tomorrow! i have a life. i can't just be up at 4 am feeling all weird and not being able to sleep. should i change drs or what??? pissed off,1

"todays been especially hard, but it comes in waves. i want to kill myself, not neccesarily because i feel like everyone hates me, but more that i just feel like life is just a game of suffering or pretending. i visited some friends at school and everything just seemed so superficial and i felt disconnected from it, and honestly was expecting something different because i have felt disconnected from everywhere else. after a traumatic event back in the fall i have not been the same since and i just struggle trying to figure out the reason for life, and get worried that all it is is suffering until death. its hitting especially hard today. i do all that i can, i am on medication, see a therapist, work a decent job, exercise, spend time with family and friends, and at this point i have no sense of self, and just do not want to carry on. i am 21 years old and already have been so uncomfortable with how life has been panning out, and just thinking about the future is extremely discouraging. please anything helpful that has helped get out of this headspace would be so appreciated does it ever go away",6

"i can post the letter i sent to her. but this to teach men to speak instead of bottling as i did. and i want you to use this to speak as men. to understand the impact it can have on a person my quote to you as a speaker and i how i see things i do not think anyone is truly human until they have gone through a mental health battle. and i also believe to be human you need to sympathise and understand each other on a emotional level. its a healthy way of communication and bringing people to closer for support. mental health is so important i think people need to understand otherwise the issue of not talking will only continue for men and women. it may create tramua and because people to close in there next relationship causing a relapse. people will always experience stress and anxieties from different situations. and depending on how important that person was to you will effect how bad your breakdown was off bottling true emotions. as mine breakdown was not talking to my ex girlfriend emma due to the situation of covid distance and jobs not coping well, it broke me. i did not tell her until 5 months after we split. so anyone who reads this before ending a life seek help and talk to your person. its how you react and causing self harm you will only create more damage to yourself and the people around you. i have done this with my relationship with her. i decided to end it just because it broke me mentally from the drastic impact and stress i had trying i be with her. but i was on the edge with her, not her fault at all she was brilliant. i was struggling because covid made it impossible to get a job 3 hours away. but i was so committed. i loved her. that is what you do for someone you love. i just ignored when she gone i was like no point now. i might as well. now the truth has come out to her as it has she only thinks i am crazy or just to give it. maybe i was easy for a little bit. bottling for such a long time does that to you. trying to take meds caused me schizophrenia. until i just had a breakdown a complete breakdown. and it did break me. i attempted to end my life 3 times. one from caffeine over does. 2 carbon monoxide. i had 1000 pills. the mental health crisis team tried to make me hate like she cheated because i was depressed and created theories in my head, you are not insane. you are normal.you are just connected with your emotions. in a much deeper way. than other people are around you. it will get better. i am struggling to let her go due to the losing her from mental health as a best mate. but overall i am doing better. and i will beat this. so to anyone struggling give that person space. take your time. it will get better. and you will find answers about why you felt a certain way or different than to your normal self i can post my entire letter. for anyone that is interested my views on mental health. this is my story.",6

when is it ok to tell someone about a psych ward visit if at all? whenever i meet someone new i always wonder when it s appropriate if at all to tell them what i m going through. only because it is such a big life event and applies to my current position. example i ve been out of work now for 3 months this was after a psych ward visit for 2 weeks and just help my family out and take time for myself time to get back to work but still nervous to . so i m talking to this guy whenever he asks me what i m up to or do i have any plans for the day or the next day you get what i mean i only have so many things to say you know. finally i just responded yesterday with yep not really much planned and ugh i kinda just want to tell him about the psych visit so he can see where i m coming from and not like i just never have anything to do. thoughts? anyone else with similar experience? when is it appropriate if at all to explain this to someone. i m passed the idea that they will think i m crazy or different or judge me i guess but still worried about it.,1

"hello, i want to apologize for the very low level of english i have, i am not a native english speaker. i have been diagnosed with depression and have had tbis with a psychiatrist since 2017. it has been very episodic as it is depression that starts through trauma or ptsd. i come to seek help here because my appointments are too short and distant from each other. i am looking for advice discussion about this, although i have done this a lot in the past and feel like i have heard it all. currently in my life it is rather quiet. no big event for 3 weeks, things are stable at this level. in fact, i want to completely detach myself from human relationships and even emotionally from things, already that i am ultra jaded and bored by everyone music, sport, video games, literature, animated, ... my passions do not stimulate me not as much as before. i also have all the things that i like my ""madeleine de proust"" which fall, become null or stop lately. i am an only child and have a great relationship with my parents, but having to see their health deteriorate and the fact that my mother almost died of illness recently plays a big role. i have also experienced a lot of relationship disappointments, even i have hardly experienced that. recently i have seen the true thoughts of my rare strong relationships. it hurts me but i accepted that deep down i get too attached and that all relationships are led to an end. time erodes them and if it is not time it will be weariness. i have heard everything at this level, i have introspected a lot, applied advice but i only come to one conclusion i have to detach myself emotionally from things. everything ended up going badly in my life, hope made me suffer and i literally have no purpose in life anymore. i do not feel like killing myself, but i am tired and jaded with life. literally everything is bad, everything sucks and it does not even make me want to try something new because things go wrong every time. level of relationships, in love it is too complex and it causes more problems than good things and in friendship i believe that the true friendship that we see in the works does not exist. i have a strong relationship but i think i got too attached and i make the same mistakes over and over. in short what do you think? i no longer have faith in human relationships",2

"hi, i am 19.i am undergoing chemotherapy weekly for an auto immune disease, the chemo makes my hair fall out. i am currently taking heavy medication to combat the hair loss but it causes erectile dysfunction, so i have to take medication to combat that. i also have to take another medication to combat the chemo making me feel sick 24 7. i studied to be a personal trainer but discovered i cannot really gain any muscle due to the chemotherapy and lost motivation. my condition is also not curable and i will be undergoing this treatment until i die. i have bad acne scarring on my face and have been diagnosed with autism and depression. i had a girlfriend but she left me when she found out what my race is. my parents are divorced and i do not have any friends. i was smoking cannabis everyday to combat medication effects and my body has now become reliant on it, this is an illegal substance in my country. i do not know what to do... reading this back crying makes me think all i wanted was a friend to talk to about my problems but nobody fucking cares. maybe someone will read this when i am dead. would you want to live in these conditions?",6
"i am 23 m - i am behind in my studies and am currently just lazing out at home on my dad's money. just now my mom came and she shouted at me with tears and anger, saying.. how she is heartly praying for her own death because of me. how i am wasting my dad's hard earned money, how i do not even care about his health. how useless and ungrateful son i am to her and many such things. i only listened to her, stayed quite. holding out my panic attack in front of her. i know how she feels, i am aware that i am a failure and unworthy person. i really blame myself every day, regarding all that she spoke of. i know what she said is all true. i am the worst kid any parents could ever have. i feel extremely guilty and like every other day i wish that i was never born. i know instead of whining here like this i should actually do something productive. i am totally aware of that. i truly despise myself from the bottom of my heart. i do not know what and how i should feel. my mom just slept crying. i am completely lost. i deserve every amount of pain i can get.",2

"worried about my gallbladder.... i'm 25, 21 bmi, not super active but i've been good about eating whole foods and fiber though i've had a bad sugar habit. i'm also on an oral contraceptive tri-lo sprintec and i cut my calories to 1,000 for a few weeks to lose weight. that, plus my irregular eating habits and tendencies to skip meals, puts me at risk for gallstones--i think. last sunday i noticed i had some really sharp pains on my right side under my ribcage. this isn't totally abnormal, i have had this before, but this time it was much sharper and deeper than normal. it lasted like a minute or so and happened a few more times but it wasn't anything serious--just left me feeling a little chilly. but for whatever reason, my brain was immediately thinking ""that's gallbladder pains"" and i got worked up. for the rest of the week, i've been panicking every time i've had a pain or sensation in the area--which has been fairly often, making me wonder if it's psychosomatic or if something is actually wrong. i've had some pangs radiate into my shoulder and my arm as well, convincing me even more it's my gallbladder and not me panicking. tmi but i also had some considerable gas and bloating throughout the week, and i woke up more nauseous than normal most morning and i've had indigestion and stomach pains a bit after eating as well. i stopped eating stuff with a lot of fat and sugar in hopes that i wouldn't have an attack worse than what i experienced sunday--in fact i cut out fat almost completely, i've been too afraid to eat it. i went for a checkup on thursday and my doctor ordered bloodtests and an ultrasound on my upper right quadrant. i haven't gotten the results yet, but i got a call from someone at the clinic a day after about information that ""my doctor wanted to share with me,"" but it went to voicemail and when i called back immediately after they never answered--just to add to my worry! and now to add even more to my worry, my urine is darker than normal, which is another sign of gallbladder dysfunction i've read about... though i did have beets for lunch ... i've been panicking about this for an entire week, and i know it's nothing to really be stressed over...i've changed my diet as much as i could and i'm getting everything taken care of, but i'm terrified of having another attack or something awry happening in between now and my blood results ultrasound. and i'm scared for many reasons of having my gallbladder out...i've never had major surgery and i've heard about chronic digestive issues people have after they get it removed...thought that definitely sounds better than having an infected gallbladder explode inside of you. just wanted to vent...i've had to keep myself off of the internet because i kept psyching myself out more and more and i think it may have ended up giving me more symptoms . i've been so doom and gloom over this and i normally can convince myself to relax even when i'm worried about something being wrong with me, but this time i haven't been. don't know if it's intuition or what.",0
i am just sitting on my bed trying to disassociate so i do not have to feel anything. if i can just control my body then i do not have to feel pain. i also cannot talk to anyone. no one wants to see my self pity or hear what i have to say. i just have to remain calm. my emotions do not help anyone. i would not mind taking a vow of silence. i feel like the key is to also think silence. just wait the surges of pain out and do not tell anyone. trying to stay still,6

"okay, i do not normally post my problems on the internet... but i am desperate for help at this point. i will keep it really cut and dry this is years and years of shit, condensed but i really want to know if i am being too ridiculous or not, because my family seems to think so... amp if a family friend who lived in your house, with your family, raped you virgin with a chronic pain disorder , would you ""expect"" your family to defend you? amp mine gaslit me and refused to believe me until it was found out years later he gave me vaginal scarring and hpv warts inside of my vaginal canal. i had to show them the proof from the doctor. he works at our family business, and lives on our property still. i have since moved out of town. but i cannot be anywhere near my family or even talk on the phone with them without hearing his name or his voice or the like. amp i let my father who runs the business know that i was working on my case with a detective, so find a replacement truck driver because once he gets interrogated he is getting kicked off the property and fired. that was almost 8 months ago. two months ago, he was given a polygraph and completely and utterly failed it. he is telling everyone at work that i am a liar and he passed the polygraph with flying colors. my brother is still best friends with him and plays video games with him 4 hours a night almost daily. he works with him. my father refuses to evict him or fire him until he finds a replacement, which has not been working out very well. amp i have been gaslit my whole life by my family, and have really bad c-ptsd that adds to my chronic pain. my rapist knows sees this stuff daily, and i guess he decided to join in because he knew my family would not believe me or defend me... but now i am getting really fucked up because i never thought it would go this far. i never thought they would spend years defending my rapist, i never thought that even after proving what he did, my family al would allow him to slander me at our family property and business. the ptsd and despair is so intense lately that i cannot pull myself out of it. i get an hour of therapy per week but it is not enough. i have been really screwed up the last several years, but after seeing my family treat me this way... after seeing my own sibling side with my rapist... after he gets to just keep going on like nothing happened.... after he gets to lie and tell everyone he passed his polygraph... after he gets to keep being apart of the family... after my family tries to make me feel guilty for having needs or feelings... i cannot take it anymore. i just cannot. amp is it ridiculous of me to expect him to be given a 30-day notice of eviction from our property? is it evil of me to ask that he be fired so i do not have to hear his name or voice over the phone anymore? is it fucked of me to feel extremely betrayed that my brother sides with my rapist? my brother already treated me like shit but i never expected him to do something quite this screwed up. he is been shown proof that i was raped, so it is not just him believing my rapist, he chooses to ignore the proof ... is it wrong to expect a ""family friend"" that is ""basically a 2nd son"" to my father, to get removed from our family? is 7 months long enough time to ""prepare"" to replace him? am i asking too much? i feel i literally cannot move on or continue breathing if i have to have him involved in my life in any way, shape, or form. my only choice has been to stop speaking to my family members. but that does not stop me from suffocating in the toxicity from afar while my family just sits idly by letting him slander me to everyone around them. it does not help me move on. it does not fix anything. i am just secluding myself more and more. i have never asked for anything this selfish in my life, so i feel insanely guilty for even asking for it... but i would rather die than to keep enduring this, and having this make my chronic pain even worse. i just need him out. i need him gone. amp i will not even go into even more fucked up details, but he also stalks women around town, and is still a sexual predator, and might possibly have an attraction to children as well given his odd behavior. unfortunately i cannot go after him for my rape because i did not get a rape kit done because i knew my family would refuse to drive me at the time, cannot drive myself with my condition. i was terrified and knew the gaslighting would trigger me to kill myself in a heartbeat with how fragile i was . but here i am, years later, still stuck in this crossroads. and now it is even worse. i just want the pain to fucking end. this is way too hard to endure alone as a handi-cap person. amp do my feelings seem justified, or am i being ridiculous? i have to ask because my entire life i have been convinced my feelings are always wrong, and i do not think ""normally"" as other people do. so i would like to ask the reddit community---what do you think a ""normal"" reaction to this situation would be? if something like this was happening to you, what would you do? i really need some other thoughts perspectives...",6

"hypomania mania doubt does anyone ever feel like their hypomania or mania isn t that bad, when in reality it is? i m always questioning my diagnosis because i feel like my mania isn t even half as bad as some things i read. or not even close to what is portrayed on tv shows or movies. recently it s been getting worse, as i ve had strong urges to do really risky stuff. for example, i had such an urge to climb up the stairs and stand and lean over the railing where a kid jumped off. and i was gonna do it to get rid of the feeling, but then i was scared that i would continue to lean and lean until i got the urge to jump off. same thing happened when i crossed a bridge except i did end up leaning into it. but before this episode, my mania was only feeling really confident, or believing i had superpowers, or paranoia that everyone was looking at me, and my irritation was really bad. like i was screaming at my computer today. just wanna know if anyone also thinks their not bipolar because their mania isn t even half as bad as they read some peoples experiences",1
"during high school i would cry pretty much every single day when i got back home. i was going through horrible low moods, my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and i would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. i had no drive or motivation for anything, but i just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. at the time i did not really realise i was depressed, i thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. i knew i was exhibiting symptoms of depression but i never really thought this is depression and i am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally, and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.i then got into university and hoped for a fresh start. i had a decent time there and socially had no problems, but i myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. this significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout university, i never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because i would have to study throughout the holidays. whilst i had multiple break downs throughout, i do not think it was as bad as during school.done with university and back with my family, because i wanted to take a small break from everything. i used to have a lot of problems with my parents, particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. again, almost like at school, i would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately, i believe i have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. we most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. at that time, i realised that i have been pretty much depressed since high school, driven by my relationship with my parents. i still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes, but we r both working to being better with each other. i got back to university but still am with my family. with the pandemic, i am stuck at home most of the time. i am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where i am completely alone. however, being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year, the stress has been continuously building up. my parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as i have pretty much since i was a kid, i would support them a lot during these times. this also subtly contributed to my stress. i had not managed to have an actual break, though i do have long periods of stress induced procrastination and eventually i messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down, like the ones i had during the worst of my times back during my old university or school years. i felt like this time, i ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression, and really felt like they could kill me. for what has been pretty much a decade of depression, bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress, i have experienced physical symptoms like pain. but right now, i feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over or it already has . i am repeating the same cycle of procrastination, self hate, not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed, even though i really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercise go out for walks. i really do not need to socialise with people and i do maintain decent contact with my friends. i feel depressed pretty much 24 7 when i am not distracting myself with music, media entertainment, socialising. i cannot focus on my studies at all and i am just so tired. i have been tired for a decade and i just do not know what to do anymore. i always tell myself that one day it just will not be like this, but i am exhausted, drained and no matter how much i rest i just feel horrible. i do not know what to do anymore. depressed since high school",2
"first of all, why do we live? for like having a good time? i do not think that is the point. all the evolution which made today's circumstances does not look like to point it. it is so obvious for me after spending my whole life just thinking about stuff, it is all about picking side. sides of this war between life and death are pretty obvious, yet so hard to see. either you choose life and fight with the problems that other side put in your life or accept the loose and side with them. everyone i know think that they are in the life's side. little they know, it is been so long that they bowed their head to death. everyone is painting the truth with their lies along with their desires. they just do not want to loose to death so they let the scummers do their job. the world built by human is literally built for the people have power to keep and raise it. majority of others is ok with it because their only hope is to be in or getting close to those positions. than what? what would they do if they reach to thier dreams? sadly, same... they are just fillers who accetped their exintance in that way. no different than any material in the world. even their behaviour has no freedom to choose other. it is like we all at a cliff and all we can think about is to use others to make us a safe zone. why we do that if there is an obvious cliff that screams ""nothing"" from below. we all serve to nothingness while we think ""we are doing our best"" to aviod it. so i want to ask again, why do we live? if i will face with nothingness, what does matter about what i do in my life time? what makes something right or wrong? adding values on it? because no matter how you live deeply your life, every value made by us destroyed same way. but before that i have to explain what i mean by fight between life and death. life comes from nothing, and makes something. death comes from something, and makes nothing. when life try to find ways for not being reachable for death, death tries to find a way to stop life's movement. like a heart rate, it kept the universe this way to us today. every decisions we make comes from one of them. it is so heartbroken to see everyone choosing death's side. because creating is hard work, if you going to do hard work it is better to do what is obvious and served, so everyone falls to the net of the death which is hanging on the cliff. they think it is safe and they covered, but little they know its all part of the plan to ending our existince. i am not delusional neither consiparcy person, it is what is going to happen in the long run as far it seems ... what is a valueable? is it money? is it water? obviusly, whatever we need has a value. the value can change along with the circumstances. for example, life. life is most valuable thing we have right? i guess not. because it is only valuable if it means something to someone else. otherwise, no one cares. it can be person who loves you or can be person who wants to use you. rather than those, it only has value for you, if you think it is valuable. so here is the question, does your life valuable for you? it is simply a potential source. you could use it to have things, but that is just a possibility. most of the time people pass before they satisfied with their gains in exchange with their life's. this is why most of the people who wants to suicide because they do not want to be other side of the fight neither to see that they are loosing. i am having the same problem, why do i live if i am going to end up with nothingness with all those pain, only gain is here to have less pain? it is pretty logical to me, but really hard to decide. what is the real problem than? is it everyone choosing the winning side or is it that there is no hope for the other side? this makes me depressed because i am pretty sure that nothing could beat an honest mind. if the life is able to come from nothingness, than nothing can defeat it. death is just there to us for improvement, not to make us giving up. we could colonize whole universe and that could be just a freaking beggining. we could choose to be anything yet we choose to be worst. i have no power to change it all, i wish i could live my life by chasing my dreams. sadly it is not allowed and i am exhausted. i had so much energy, so much willpower but they all been sucked by monsters to place me next to other billions of lost existances. hope you find a way to fight with it, it seems i will not be able to hold on in close future. i have questions",6

"i do not even know why i am fucking writing this. the last few years i have had on depression if you can call it that . but this feels the worst i have really been. i am numb inside like just flat lined, nothing. i have had cbt therapy, counselling sessions, anti depressants before and whole bunch of other crap that only works for a short time. i slowly realised that most of my life has been trauma or abuse from family, environment, education, health, friends, girlfriends, life. i recently realised that a day does not go by where i do not get a fucking flashback to the past to a bad situation and that i do not have any happy memories. being back at home for the summer with my parents till i am back at university has definitely not helped. i feel like i have accomplished nothing with my life. 28 years old, no savings, no life, living with parents that have issues themselves. i know i am not in a good place right now but i do not care anymore, i have no fight left inside. i actually want to die.i have always helped people, fixed shit that needed to, been the fucking foundations and rock for other people in the past and think to myself what wasted effort. as selfish as it sounds, no one actually cares about me, no one wants me, no one gives a crap, and this is something i have realised time and time again. i am always alone, everything i do, i do it by myself. no one shows up to any birthdays or they cancel for the last 15 years so i do not bother and spend it by my self. i feel like i fall in the cracks of every aspect of life. i understand that i should be grateful for the things that i have, but id give that all up and do anything to remember what true happiness feels like one last time. i used to make an effort with my appearance, health and with myself. since corona, i do not care about my appearance anymore, i am losing my hair, i am gaining weight. i have lost the desire to drink smoke socially. i have no faith or trust left in friends, family, teachers, basically most things, all they do is disappoint, let down, pick on, bully, backstab or do something really dumbrecently i realised i have anxiety and have become and introvert. i have withdrawn from all social media and become a hermit. i do not even talk to anyone not even my sisters or step sisters. i do not know why i am writing this, i guess i have gone through so much crap in my life i am sick and tired of it all, sorry for sounding like a pathetic piece of garbage, but in all honesty i am not afraid of dying, at least ill feel something. m28, dissociating, empty, numb, just living to die",2

"convinced i'm dying from visiting auto body shop hi everyone, so basically i m freaking out because i m thinking about how i used to visit my estranged dad s body shop from time to time growing up during the summer. i can t imagine that i would have gone more than 10-15 times or so in a given summer, and some years i probably only went a couple of times, others none at all. i would go to work with him to wash vacuum cars, answer the phone, and sometimes wetsand cars. however, there would be times where i would follow him around to his back shop to check on his employees. or, i would go back there to let him know that a customer was waiting for him. i m currently freaking out bc i can t imagine that being in that environment while guys were doing work could have been good for me, even though i wasn t doing any sanding or painting myself. his back shop is rather large, and he would keep his garage doors open for ventilation see building on the left . i think i remember a couple of times in the winter i was there and he had the doors shut though. i probably opened the door to the paint booth a handful of times to scream in there that someone was waiting for him. my biggest fear is that i ll wind up getting cancer or something years down the line from now. i probably first went to his shop when i was 5, and stopping visiting after i was 18 or 19. i have no idea how secondhand exposure to this stuff works. does this limited secondhand exposure to dust paint as a kid pretty much guarantee problems down the road? or does that typically require years of direct exposure? was my dad 100 in the wrong for letting me come to work with him in the first place? part of me thinks that its quite common for kids to go their family-owned businesses, but still. it s gotten to the point where these thoughts dominate my mind, and its very difficult to care about anything, since i feel like i m dead anyway. i think its entirely possible that i m overreacting, and this anxiety is brought on by the fact that i just graduated college and started my first job. can someone please let me know what they think? edit i found some pictures of his shop so that you can see what the environment was like, for what its worth",0

"so basically i know i am a bit insecure person but i try my best to never tell someone about it and pretend that i am fine with it. but i am really too much sad because of the ""jokes"" made by my girlfriend and her male friends. so basically my girlfriend has only male friends and i really do not have any problem with that. so in our friends group too she is the only girl. so me and my girlfriend are in 2 common instagram group chats where she is the only female. so all the other people flirt with her, make jokes and she does not care and even replies to them, around 1 month ago she and her friend intentionally flirted in front of me by saying ""can i come to your bed tonight"" and i ignored it because she always says that they are just ""jokes"". but the next day they intentionally made the same joke again, and this time i told her friend that these jokes are inappropriate and her friend talked to me in a rude way with very abusive words and in the end they said ""we were doing a prank to make you jealous"". this really made me too sad for few days, later she apologized. now the same things have started again, in one group chat almost everyone is flirting with her, one guy even made a joke about marrying her. in the other group chat, our common friend literally moaned her name in a voice note 3 times and she continued the joke. then the common friend said to me ""your girlfriend is falling for me and she wants to cheat on you"" in the group chat and she still thinks it is a joke. i already have a low self esteem where i always think that everyone is better than me and when i tell someone this they blame me by saying i am insecure. i am really tired of this, it literally feels like that i am a loser who cannot do anything.also my girlfriend is too insecure too, when i talk to any girl she taunts me a lot and to everyone ""that is cute"". we had a common female friend in that gc and my girlfriend said ""you need to take my permission before talking to each other"". and everyone thought ""it was cute"" because she is a girl. while she literally flirts with everyone, and everyone insults me and it is still a joke. i am suicidal again after months because something bad happened today. my life is already too bad and i always feel like a burden to everyone and today i had a a really bad day.",6

"i am depressed and sometimes i feel like i just want to isolate myself from everyone and just focus on myself and my dreams but i know that will not give me the same happiness as if i did it with her, i believe that a 100 years of suffering is worth a single second with true happiness and no regrets but i also believe that there is another totally opposite second that is make you truly sad and regret that you did not off yourself sooner and that is probably the second you off yourself so i am not sure if i dare to keep on living, i have seen small improvements that i have done to my live as a person but i still feel like i am still living the shit life doing stupid decisions as before and i cannot keep on living like this, i am a very stubborn person so if i cannot have my happiness then i do not want to keep on going sad over everything",2
"imposter syndrome and anxiety about learning more about this disorder hi. this post could be triggering to others with imposter syndrome, so i want to start off by saying that these are my own anxieties, my goal here is to know if anyone else has felt this way and if they've been able to circumvent it. i was officially diagnosed with bp2 by my psychiatrist in the fall, but had previously been diagnosed with a general mood disorder and major depressive disorder, and a suggestion of cyclothymia from a therapist. bipolar 2 makes sense to me, it tracks with situations and periods of my life where i was feeling unnaturally confident and ""fun"" in a dangerous way, and more often, the periods where i've been unable to get out of bed or the house for weeks. still, i have this weird fear of learning more about bipolar disorder, because there's a part of me that fears that if i read about it in-depth, i might start mirroring symptoms that i don't usually experience. sometimes this includes even browsing or participating in this sub and r bipolar2. i think being medicated with varied success also plays into that, but i also think that's just a common bipolar experience you find good meds and then you wonder if you're even bipolar. i feel that way when they work, but i keep on taking them. and then i will have breakthrough depression after years of being more stable on meds, and i wonder if it's a sign that i have something else wrong with me. so, to those that have survived imposter syndrome... how? is there a way to not be afraid to learn about your own medically diagnosed disorder... or to just accept that i have this disorder, without constantly questioning myself?",1

"i used to want to do things, now i do not. i just work, and that is fine. maybe if i keep working i can get a better job and make more money and get out of debt, and then have some self confidence. the only thing i still want, is a family. i would need a girlfriend for that first, but, hahahaha yeahhhh i am pretty tired of all the rejection. i figured i will just improve myself and then someone who likes me will come along eventually, and i will not blow it. i do not really know what else i can do. i am in good shape, i am good at a musical instrument, i have a good job, i am pretty good at a second language, i have a stem degree, people say i am attractive etc. i attract potential mates, but then it is like all of a sudden they realize they are not interested. it is kind of sad to see that happen over and over. it feels worse than just outright upfront rejection because initially they like me, but then after they get to know me they do not like me, ouch. still though, i am in a studio apartment and it seems like i am barely making it by. i know the meme that it gets better, and i do not doubt that, i just hope it does not get better too late, and i lose my window of opportunity to have a family. i used to love the guitar and i always wanted to be a famous guitar player. nowadays, i do not even know what to practice. i do not feel the same drive to get better at guitar that i used to have, and it seems like at this point it is extremely hard to improve. i have been trying to master bebop imrov for quite a few years, and i just cannot seem to make much headway. i think the depression has a lot to do with it, because my memory sucks, and my cognitive abilities kind of lag, so it is hard to keep up with the changes. plus making mistakes really kills my mood, and i make a ton of them. i know it sounds like i am just complaining, and i guess i am, but i just needed to complain a bit. i do not really have anyone to talk to about this. therapy is a bit out of my price range at the moment, not to mention, my job is located somewhere very remote.anyway, thanks for reading. i do not really enjoy anything except for eating drinking. i am not looking forward to anything except maybe the depression going away.",2

"i have called the suicide hotline three times in my life. all three of those times, though through no fault of the caller, i have felt less listened to and heard than if i were to just ramble to my friends or internet strangers.'active reflexive listening' is a good tool when people use it correctly, but what i have been met with when calling has been the basic 'i hear ' or 'you sound '. yes, i appreciate your insight, but i do not need to be told my feelings when i want to slit my wrists while listening to my favorite songs as i black out from loss of blood. does anybody else have this problem of eye-rolling when trying to seek help? i feel so selfish and frustrated at the same time. i have a therapist, but manic depression prevents me from caring about my meetings. i force myself to log on, put on a smile, and try to be insightful about my problems until nobody's eyes are on me again and i can take off my mask of mental health again into the faceless being i seem to be identifying with more and more. i am just so tired of everything. i am tired of human interaction in general. i do not know how to keep my energy as it and most of my positivity ends up jumping ship as soon as it can. i am tired of putting on a strong face and of bottling up all of this overdue crying i do not let myself experience. once upon a time i would have loved to hear a friendly 'everyone fucks up, it will be okay' but now i do not want to hear anything. i want to lock myself up and stare at the ceiling. i want to impose prison time on myself so that i am less responsible for a life i do not care about. i do not want my corpse to be found. that is the most honest reason for not dying already. my family's reaction. my sister's disappointment when she is dealt with this as well. but, i do just not want to wake up. i want a heat seeking one person disintegration missile comet type thing to just do its thing.i will probably call the hotline tonight and roll my eyes again. pushing away positive changes as i always do. ignoring things i do not want to hear. pretending the past is not the curse tainting any chance at happiness because i was afraid to try. taking solace in the fact that we all eventually disappear. meanwhile browsing tiktok lives to get noticed by strangers and attain a slight bit of validation that will end up disappearing in the air like all of those exhales after smoking - anything to numb my head and my body. i want to let myself cry, but i am worried i will never stop at this point. i am alone. truly. but we all are. not sure of the point of this post now as the walls of dissociation come back up. thank you for reading. thank you for still breathing. thank you for being a part of this community and being vulnerable. the suicide hotline and other selfish rants",6
i want to stop thinking about it. i have never attempted but have been in a psych ward and not allowed to leave for thoughts of it and alcoholism. i keep thinking of trying to hang myself though and i am scared it will progress to actually doing it. i do not want to go back to the psych ward though. it was like jail and very expensive and there is a spike in covid in my area. i relapsed recently in drinking. i was doing so well and now all i can think about is how sick and miserable i am. a guy i liked told me not to contact him for a week after i quit drinking. i guess he did not really like me that much. all i can do it seems like is sit here feeling sorry for myself. i hate it. i do not know how to snap out of it. i want suicidal ideation to stop,6

"i had some friends in high school. i had some friends in college. i always thought these ""friends"" should initiate contact first. but they did not. after getting tired of seeing the same faces over and over again i deleted them out of spite. but that was maybe a year or two ago. what ""friends"" i have now are people i have fallen out of touch with or who live somewhere else or have moved up to the next stage of life.now i do not have any friends, and it is all my fault. i contemplate suicide daily and wonder who would give a an eff if i just disappeared tomorrow, just as people disappear from our minds as we fall out of touch with them. people never called me on the telephone anyway, not since the 00's when i was growing up. i guess i am just a useless piece of garbage. i am all alone. i am a she will of the person i used to be",2
"i just want to explain how fucking terrible i feel. i am young, a 20y female who generally has had mental health struggles since childhood due to being diagnosed and treated with severe clinical depression and lots of trauma from a variety of areas. i made it through no friends and lacking support systems, and the many misdiagnoses from a variety of adults. i have failed at getting into my dream career of joining the military which i know is such a stupid thing to be sad about but i had no other plans and could not afford college on my own. i starved and had developed a eating disorder to still miss by 1.5 inches per the standards.i managed to recover from that. i somehow managed to sit through a pandemic and be kind and caring even when it felt like i was the last bit of kindness left. i had gotten an apartment and spent the entire year and some change in quarantine. yet here i am so angry, and exhausted, and hurt i literally could end it all and i do not think i would mind. i have seen the people i care about, what feels almost like the final time, i have given them the quiet goodbye, i hope they do not figure it out. i am ready to go, i am ready to stop and be at peace for once. i am ready. i want to die. and as i am typing this i am unsure if anyone will care, and i do not have any plans that matter enough to keep me here, i think, maybe it will hurt my parents, and my best friend who have all lost important people to this demon before. but i am tired of fighting it everyday as it gets stronger, my hands shake, and every morning i cry wishing this would all end. i am laying my sword down. i am giving up. everything is bleeding and my bones are broken, and i am alone. and i do not want to fight myself anymore. i have been in this place before, but now there is no real reason to keep going this time.",6
"i cheated on my now ex. i hid the fact that i was talking to two other people. i went on a few dates with one of them. nothing sexual or physical ever happened with either, but i cheated through and through. i lied to my ex so many times, right to their face. even now i have not come clean. i ruined a great relationship for no good reason and really hurt someone. i do not think i can ever live this down or forgive myself for what i did. i cheated",6
"first time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as i have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. i have had an issue with weed since i was 19 did not accept i had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that i ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space . cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, i cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person i am. used to have friends in uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking i would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. rinse and repeat . got together with someone from a local sporting community i was involved in and had tons of friends in it. i let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. when we broke up, and i very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury i can walk again now, thankfully , it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and i lost what i thought were very close friends. no one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how i was. it destroyed me for a while but i talked myself into believing i was better off without people like that. it still stung and i basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick i had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. i was not around to defend myself due to the injury and i guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. a further indication of how low they view me. that was a good few years ago and i still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that i am clearly a pos if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. out of sight, out of mind.i feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. i hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind i am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring self indulgent an asshole etc. this has further made me withdraw as i do not want to inconvenience others. i have a good job i feel i do not deserve, which i am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low i am. i do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if i killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. i have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, i can be quite nervous with intimacy. i have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. i have found myself thinking if i killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. i have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as i know if i do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. i cannot shake the feeling that i am the worst thing for him and that i am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. i have a supportive family. my mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and i find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". i have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh i do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when i was a small kid. i have a brother but he is estranged from the family. we very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times he has his own mental health issues and i think blames our family for a lot of it. . i have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and i love them all very much. but. i feel like if i killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.i can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. that sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. i hate that i get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. i am abnormal and i feel like i bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. i cannot stop thinking i am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. when i see people i know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, i feel like an ungrateful pos that i have a working healthy body and yet want to die. i do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way i could trade. i wish that i could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. that if i killed myself, the x amount of years i did not live could transfer over to someone else.if i killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. if i killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan i gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. if i killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. if i killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. if i killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. if i killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. if i killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. if i killed myself, i cease to be a burden after the funeral has been planned and done . if i killed myself, depending in the means, i could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.i know my mind is clearly twisted right now but i cannot stop thinking that if i honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. i am miserable, i constantly try to suppress it or hide it, i feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. i have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where i ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. i just want to die but know it will hurt my family. good live from the outside but i just want to press ""off""",2

hi first post here so sorry if i m doing anything wrong recently i ve been suffering from very intense anxiety and panic attack nearly every night they re usually triggered around midnight and last through to around 9am normally preventing me from getting any sleep at all during the night my bedroom also seems to be one major trigger a i m able to calm myself down sometimes but a soon a i re enter my bedroom the panic flare up all over again and it s like i m in full fight or flight mode during the daytime the panic is almost nonexistent i think the most difficult part is that it generally happens during hour when nobody is around to give me comfort so strong feeling of isolation and hopelessness often accompany that brings me to my question for anyone who ha experienced nightly anxiety what ha brought you comfort during a time when you re unable to reach out to others i would love to hear about your experience and the thing that have helped bring you comfort in a time of isolation thanks,2

"i am going to be 37, i have two dogs and a cat that i love. my mom loves me and i have a couple friends who i see maybe every two months. i have been on bupropion and buspar for about 3 months, but i am still just. so lonely and feel like my brain is just so hardwired now to despair, i really cannot imagine feeling actual joy. i stay in bed all weekend aside from caring for my pets and hardly care for myself. i got out of a relationship about two years ago that really depleted what little confidence i had. going further back, my parents divorced when i was 14 15, and my sister passed when i was 16. i flunked out of college, had a solid hospitality career and now have a solid hr career where i make decent money to take care of myself. i used to be one of those people others said was beautiful, but i have gained 110 lbs since high school i am 60 but that is still a lot and i just feel disgusting but cannot get the weight off. i have had fewer suicidal thoughts since i have started taking meds but tonight i feel awful and like the world could definitely do without me, id hardly be missed. i do not think i have the mental capacity to ever feel different. i think this is it, just some below average gross person now, and i hate myself. i am going to tell my family i will not be going to a wedding at the end of august because i do not want anyone to see how ugly i have gotten, and how little i have accomplished, and that i have nobody who cares for me. i just cannot face them. new here",2

"i have been a sports fan all my life.i also have been thinking about killing myself literally since i can remember. in many ways i feel my life is like a movie i have not seen yet but already know the ending to it. it ends with suicide, i have known this always.i grew up in s country that had not a lot of access to baseball, it was more of a soccer kind of a country. circumstances have lead me to be only partially employed at the same time my marriage is going thru a rough patch. i think it is safe to say this is the most depressed i have been in my life. folks, i am not sure how i come out of this one.enter mlb opening day. always been a baseball fan but never had the time and resources to really really follow a season i get the mlb thingy for free with my phone provider so... i watch all the games, every single game my team plays. i know the names, the averages the everything. baseball has given me a reason to look forward to tomorrow, to see what happens the next weekend, the next series. my team sucks this year by the way but i do not even feel bad about it! i am like riding a high, while my world and my life collapse around me i am sitting like an idiot watching baseball and loving it!truth is, we are halfway thru the season and i am dreading the end. no more baseball, no more looking forward. no more games means i can focus on my dark and gloomy circumstances and the fighting and the crying and i honestly do not know if i have the energy to keep putting up with it all.so here i am.not in immediate risk of offing me but scared oh so scared of what the future may bring.tldr i do not think i am making it to christmas people, love you all. i honestly think baseball is saving my life for now",6

"i am really depressed because my life is bad, not due to mental illness. i am a divorced mom with no other family, or friends, so no support system at all. not even anyone to bounce ideas off of, get feedback etc.and i have asperger's, so have a hard time with regular jobs and work from home doing basically online gig work. but i am well educated. and i am way older than most posters here. and i am like 90 lbs and have problems with fainting sometimes. 1 i have tried therapy but that did not help at all. it made things worse. probably because that is not the type of help i need. plus when i told my therapist that i was feeling overwhelmed with having to do everything myself without any help, all she did was tell me how she did everything herself without any problem before she was married. and she is never had kids. 2 being locked up in a mental hospital would make things worse. in part because my issues are not a mental illness. but also, if i miss even one day of work i risk not being able to pay my rent and being homeless. so i would come out if the hospital with no place to live and none of my problems solved. - but - i am so unhappy with my life, and so over stressed with everything that i cannot live this way much longer. i wake up everyday thinking it would be better to just die because i am losing all hope that at this point in my life, that my life can get any better. or become good enough to be worth living. i do not see how i can pull myself out of this mess entirely alone. i need some other sort of help. i am not even sure what. maybe a family that could sort of adopt me as their kid my parents are both dead , people who could even just pretend to be friends with me, maybe someone who could help me out now and then with stuff around the house when it just becomes too much for one person to do etc. just something like that to make it a bit easier. basically family and friends, or pretend ones i guess. any ideas? is there any way to get help that is not 1 talk therapist or 2 being in a mental hospital?",6

"i tried to kill myself a couple weeks back. as i am writing this, in fact, i am trembling with temptation, spiralling into only the start of a dreadful depressive episode.it was horrendous, i was looking over that wall, scraping it with rage, my nails collecting the crumbs of cement underneath them.i was on the third floorof my school building.id just run out of the deputy principals office. why was i there? i do not quite remember. could be a few things. but she was taking too long, my head overflowing with suicidal thoughts, i bolted.next thing i knew i was looking down. the cement on the floor, the tree, i could just reach from the wall the leaves cold and wet, so were my fingers, my eyes, stinging, so very sore from holding back so much emotion, they were sensitive to the touch, freezing cold rage streaming down my cheeks, my will to live fading before my eyes as i went to thrust myself over something, someone, pulled me back.my deputy principal, smiling back at me, gripping my arm firmly.please i pleaded. she quietly and gently but forcefully led me down to her office and talked to me with the councillor.one thing i will never be able to wrap my head around is that, that wall,is right next to a staff room. with staff in it. teachers. adults, were in there.and i know, i saw them. not one even thought to even ask me why i was out of class.i am not at all ok, at the moment. but so so so many good things have happened since then.just remember that,suicide is a long term solution to a short term problem.and if everyone has forgotten to tell you this, you are awesome, and i love you. i hope this helps someone out there. i am scout, i am 16.",6

"things have changed. even before the pandemic things were bad in terms of meeting people but now it is even worse. it is almost and probably is, impossible.the city i live in is unique in terms of it as a high turnover rate therefore incidences of meeting people, specifically bad people, is higher than normal cities. but nevertheless, the same trials and tribulations go on anywhere. but being said, everything in this post is tailored to the city that i live in.but what happened? it is so difficult to meet anybody anymore. older women, like women my age, they are broken, bruised, jaded, and fed up because they are approached by pieces of garbage constantly. he is gotten to the point where i cannot even make eye contact with a woman when i am walking past her on a sidewalk. they literally look down or look away because they are tired of being approached. also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city, and again, it is impossible. within this gigantic sea of terrible men, there are few good men drowning, not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time, energy, good souls, and the possibility of memorable love. i am tired of fighting through the walls being built by women and forged by pieces of garbage men. i am fed up, and it makes me enormously depressed.i never had a problem dating in this city in the past, but now i cannot get a foot in the door, a word in edgewise and i know it is not me. even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. most of the women that are younger, they want money. they want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.then you have a lot of left-leaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? in the worst of it is, the vaccine. if you did not get a vaccine, you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. and i thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. what do i know.what i do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely. i am a good guy, dedicated, intelligent, talented. every single night after the sun sets, reality sets into how lonely i really feel. and there is this dark hope inside of me saying there is somebody out there but i really do not think so.we dug our own holes here. we have become so selective, so judgmental, some materialistic, so single-minded, our eyes are not open, and we push people away. we would rather be alone because we are afraid to catch a virus. we would rather be alone because we do not want to deal with the possibility of somebody losing their job and becoming dependent on the other. we would rather be alone because it is easier to lump everybody into a category that supports a divide that is country wide.where i agree with most of that, and i am an introvert, so i understand being alone, but damn do i want to hold somebody is hand. the state of dating...",2

"writing this i am not depressed, just a depressing thought. i am so used to never being chosen first, and friends reaching out to hangout with me. or ex's trying to make it work instead of leaving and probably never thinking of me again... happened recently, dropped me like yesterdays paper i do not feel value or wanted and it is a feeling i desire. but as an adult those things kind of leave you and you focus on yourself and hold those close to you closer. and maybe one day you will find the one who is been looking for you, in the mean time i am going to do the best i can and try to be my best self without relying on someone else for that support, because as i have realized people word does not mean anything and people change. but you will not change, you are stuck with yourself your whole life so become someone you enjoy being even if it is not easy or fun all the time. hope someone reads this and can relate, it helps to know people feel the same way as you do i miss the days when people would reach out to me, and ask me questions, and miss me, and think of me before someone else.",2

"i am not suicidal but the thought of it is nice. but if i had the opportunity to rent a studio apartment and vegetate in it, i would.i would go to work, order all groceries and essentials online, including clothing. i would turn off all the lights, lock the door and shit the windows. i would keep it clean and never talk to anyone unless it was absolutely necessary.i do not feel like a failure because i am a logical person who knows that there is no such thing as a failure or a successful person.at the end of the day, i was born with shit genetics, to a garbage family. i no longer care about myself enough to maintain my health if shit hit the fan.if i got cancer, i would let it kill me. it is simply not worth the effort.all of my hopes and dreams have been crushed. my health is deteriorating for a while now for no reason i am not going into detail about that so please take my word for it and i have never really gotten anything i wanted in terms of making progress towards the dreams and passion i used to have.life sucks. i wish it did not. i am only 19 and i cry every night thinking about what could have been and what will not be, from a purely statistical and reasonable hindsight perspective. i am not the type to lie. i almost never lie and i am just being realistic.i do not enjoy anything anymore, i do not make goals or plans anymore. i do not want to be around anyone. i do not want a family. i do not want friends. i do not want a loving romantic relationship. i do not want pets. i do not like people, which is ironic, because i hate myself and i am finally realizing i dislike other people more.no offense to other people, of course, but i just hate human interaction. i really do. maybe i am just sleep deprived and rambling but i cannot name a single time i have ever truly been happy without some sort of dopamine releasing drug. i mean, sure, when i was a kid and still enjoy video games i laughed and giggled, but that was not happiness.and ya know what, i do not even care about happiness. i cannot remember the last time i was truly content. to be content is to be able to sit on a bench, without any stimulation from an external source, and to be able to say ""woah. life is pretty cool, i guess.""yeah. never felt that way and probably never will.some will call me lazy or a loser, but from my perspective, life is not worth the effort. this is going to sound harsh but i do not even believe in love. i never tell anyone i love them. not my parents, family members, past friends, etc. they always get so mad but i do not have it within me to fucking say that shit. it is so far beyond my functioning that i feel fake as fuck saying it.but then other times, i question if i really do not love my parents. and for the most part... well that is where i am going to end this.i am not happy. life gets worse and i am not counting on the grass being greener on the other side. i am not going to be one of those people that cheers myself up by putting other people down. so i save money and wait to afford apartment. then i block everyone and sleep and work. i do not care anymore.",2
"how can i manage my stress in these situations? over the past few weeks the relationship with one of my roommates has soured and we are debating taking him to court for coercion and withholding of owned money. while i m not going to be the one taking him to court, the tension in the home has caused me an incredible amount of stress and anxiety. i ve been having chest pain, heart palpitations, and often feel like i m breathing through a straw. i can t move out for about a month yet and i m trying to manage this stress the best i can, but it keeps piling up and getting worse. i don t feel comfortable in my home or room unless the door is locked, but hearing them walk around really spiked my anxiety. my sleep is getting worse and i ve been waking up with anxiety attacks. i don t have anywhere else i can go to escape this, and i just want to feel even slightly better. i don t feel comfortable even making myself food because they re always in the shared living spaces. does anyone have any advice for how i can manage my stress anxiety during this difficult time?",0

"need support asap for rabies fear!! so on january 4th almost 2 weeks ago i pet, and gently moved, a friendly cat out of the road by a local restaurant. he let me pick him up under one arm in my fluffy winter coat without too much resistance or fighting back, but darted off a little peturbed once i moved him. he may have lightly dug his claws in for balance and surprise at being moved- but as a germaphobe who is very afraid of cat scratch fever, i feel i would've noticed excessive claws making it through my winter layers. i went about my night my birthday night without much else of a thought for the cat. the next morning i did discover a fair amount of dried bleeding and cut scraped area on my elbow that i'm still not sure how it came to be. but again, i patched it up and went about my days. its since healed fine. i wasn't intoxicated, but i had been out dancing late and thought maybe i bumped it at some point. fast forward to today, january 17th, and the talk of rabies comes up. suddenly i remember the cat and mysterious scratch. surely i would've known if the cat did it? he was friendly, docile, and clean. i figured he belonged to some one living in the city located nearby to the place we were eating at since he was chubby and had a soft clean coat. but now i'm freaked out! should i talk to my dr about getting a rabies shot now?! its been 2 weeks on saturday. i fully intend to call my dr in the morning and have spoken to the nurse hotline. i just know they also kind of have to give me the ""just in case"" response and would like some more candid input .",0

"how do you make therapy work? i don t know what to do in therapy, we usually just sit there in silence as my therapist does grounding exercises saying things like notice the things around you, your breaths, all your senses etc to help with my anxiety and then she asks the dreaded question what do you want to work on today? like hell if i know, even when i do know i won t say it cause of my anxiety. i told her about my anxiety and possible avpd which we ve been learning about together even though it s information i already know but honestly at least we re doing something . i want to get deep into my trauma, my mentality, my thought processes, who i am, just everything about what caused this hell but i feel like we re getting nowhere because my therapist doesn t bring us anywhere. it s like asking a blind man for directions. i tried telling her that i like it when she leads the conversation which she has been trying, but in the end she s not leading enough. i know in therapy a therapist shouldn t lead and let the patient control their session but honestly i just wish someone would ask me a bunch of very leading harsh to the point questions with no way out so i can talk about my feelings without feeling guilty and selfish or embarrassed. amp i know nobody is probably going to answer, but in the minuscule chance that you do, you have my eternal thanks and appreciation.",4
"one side of my face is doing some very weird things - swollen gums, a lump in my jaw, ear ache and now i ve woken up and i can t hear out of my ear, could it be a tumor? i m panicking so much that i m not sure how i m going to make it through work today, i m shaking, i can t think straight. at first i thought it was my wisdom tooth coming through as the swelling and pain was around that area and i could feel the crown coming up, then the swelling went down but the pain remained, then i felt pain in my jaw and noticed there was a large lump on it that wasn t there before, it felt a bit like bone. that s still there and it still aches, but then yesterday my ear started aching and i ve just woken up this morning and it still hurts and it feels full so i can t hear out of it. i m scared there s a tumor growing in that side of my face which is causing everything to hurt, and is blocking my ear canal. i ve booked a dentist appointment for the swelling gums and everything and i m going to get a doctors appointment asap although there s like a 2 week turnaround at the moment. i m so worried guys what is happening to me?",0
struggling to re-adjust my sleeping pattern after depressive episode - any tips? hi all. i'm looking for some practical advice. i've been pretty depressed the past couple months since i quit my job in october. i'm also studying at uni and have like 6 hours of contact time a week. i've really been struggling to find a reason to get out of bed in the morning and so my sleeping pattern has been destroyed. my circadian rhythm is now set almost in reverse. i don't feel tired until 4 5 am in the morning and wake up around 3 4 pm in the afternoon. i've upped my meds seroquel which used to help me sleep at night but it isn't really making much difference at the moment. i'm desperate to try and re-adjust my pattern because it's making my low mood even worse. it gets dark early here in the winter so i have no exposure to sunlight. i'm running on a different time to everyone else so i get minimal socialisation. it's preventing me from passing out of my depressive phase big time.,1

"i am a colorful portrait of bipolar, adhd, anxiety, trichotillomania, insomnia, and binge eating and i need advice i was recently diagnosed with bipolar a month ago. at the age of 13, i was diagnosed with adhd, trichotillomania, anxiety, insomnia and a binge eating disorder. i didn't seek medication until i was 18 as my family refused me any meds. in which i was placed on adderall and xanax. after 3 years, my body began to digest it differently causing constant need to have my meds adjusted until he suggested vyvanse. xanax never needed to be adjusted nor did i experience addictive side effects. my doctor would take me off of xanax to see if i experienced and adverse effects. with vyvanse i was able to focus, avoid binge eating all together without any issues maintaining a normal diet. my mood swings were gone, i was even able to sleep normally as once the meds wore off, i was tired and ready for bed by 9 30am now with my new diagnosis of bipolar, which came apparent when mania appeared out of nowhere once i stopped taking vyvanse when waiting for new insurance due to moving out of state, the meds are expensive as hell at 200 bucks my doctor now has me on lamictal 100mg for depression seroquel 50mg for my mania and insomnia, and hydroxyzine 50mg for my anxiety. my mania and depression are gone, although these meds do nothing for my anxiety. i am still dealing with the mood swings i often experienced with adhd. i am quickly irritable or angry over the smallest things. no attention to anything.. like i stopped writing this post 3 times lmao no motivation, and i am back to binge eating. i have asked my doctor to allow me back on my vyvanse in which he has told me no until my mood stabilizes. it has and then he has told me my mania may happen with vyvanse even tho he stated this med carries a small risk due to the way it metabolizes. i have never experienced mania during vyvanse and i am so worried about my binge eating symptoms in which i have gained 60 pounds since last october, and my lack of attention and along with my impulse issues. i see my psychiatrist again today and i am wondering if i should insist that i am placed back on my adhd meds as a trial run? i have tried most non-stimulants such as concerta which just led to me being even more exhausted than i normally am atm. any advise would be appreciated lt 3 thank you in advance",1

"yes i am jealous of good looking people. yes i know it is vein. i hate everything about my body and how i look. i am always going to be the ugly duckling, or at best, a 'slightly below average joe'. i get looks of people feeling sorry embarrassed disgusted at me. but hey at least i am ""a genuinely nice guy"". i have absolutely zero confidence. i always feel inferior to better looking people, even if they fall behind me in other areas. i feel like i am not even worthy to be in their presence. people who say beauty is only skin deep are just kidding themselves. good looking people get so much more in life. a lot of little things throughout their lives that add up. they just have that natural confidence, which is hard to fake. this just makes them even more attractive. who wants to be with an anxious and insecure guy? this manifest into all areas of life, not just dating sex, but also at work and other areas. thank god i can now wear a face mask and it is no longer weird. for once, i would love to hear someone comment that i am hot handsome sexy. no one turns around to check me out. and i do not blame them, i would not either. my friend is really good looking and a personality that just attracts people we are gay, not a couple . he always got guys wanting to go out with him, wanting to do things for him, flirting with him etc. no one flirts or smiles at me. in fact, i know they are thinking why does my friend even hang out with an unfortunate like myself we have been friends since school . i always wonder what it is like being a porn star and being hot and confident with your body, and wanting to show it off to other people. i envy them. i really do. i am cursed to live out the rest of this retched existence being one of the millions of 'uglies' no offence to ugly people , and i cannot stand it. i could win lotto tomorrow, and i still would not be happy. yay, i am a millionaire, but i am ugly. being ugly or unattractive is the worst curse to have in this life",2

"i will not go on a long ass post on why i hate myself or why i feel sorry for myself at the moment. my whole life is kind of shitty, alcohol, coke, ketamine, sleeping pills etc are the only things that make living bearable. just like the title says the only thing that keeps me from killing myself is the guilt that others will feel after i die. that is it, i am blackmailed by my own guilt and its a fucking rancid reason to be alive. someone try to give me reason better than guilt. i live hundreds of miles away from any family and my best friend killed herself when were 18, if you can try to give me a reason or even reason with me id appreciate it. i am sick of living my life in guilt, this is not a way to live. the only thing that keeps me alive is guilt",6

"people tend to say my view on the world is pretty negative while i just think i see it as it is. i have a very distinct and active sense for for sure just my point of view justice. i think humanity overall has no interest in creating justice for everybody. the people who are rich get richer and the poor countries get exploited as far as possible. humans tend to hate others for being themselves and liking what they like. and i can never stop being that dumb social justice warrior in my head. i get the feeling that i ruin the atmosphere when people make sexist or racist jokes and i tell them that it is critical what they said because what we mean and say often are different things. i also study something where i am confronted with this kind of stuff everyday. i like it because the people who study with me are also more of social justice warriors who want to talk about the effect of what we say rather than thinking i am a killjoy. my problem is i do not want to be like that. i just feel so responsible that the people who get discriminated feel better, that the people stop saying dumb shit that really hurts the people and how others look at them. i just want my head to stop thinking everytime ""well that was pretty discriminating against whoever"". i just want people to be sensitive towards the feeling of others and listen to each other. i also listen to those people and try to tell them why i think it is critical to say it. i do not want to be entitled but i want to go into a dialogue. i am always political and on a high level of society view and cannot get rid of it for a few hours to chill. i hate it. and the most ironic part i hate having trouble or arguments where people feel attacked by me. discussion yes but not on a personal base like ""you are a bad person"". but often the people think i want to criticise them and their point of view.i am sorry this was more of a rant but especially when i am longer time on reddit i get those struggles. i do not want the people to have the same opinion but it is just so much hate often in here where the people do not even try to understand what the other person wanted to say. thanks for reading. hope anyone can relate and i am not just a big asshole that seems like i want to tell all of you what kind of a good person i am. i really think it sucks and i seem unfun. i kind of hope that this ongoing feeling that it is kind of my responsibility goes away when if depression gets better... maybe i am just holding on to that in my head so i feel like i have at least a moral i can follow and do not go insane and more lost than i already am. i cannot shut my mouth when i see something i think is unfair or unrealistic",2
"as the title says, i feel defeated. ready to just end my life and never have to worry about this constant cycle of stress, only to see a glimmer of hope that gets crushed as soon as you think it is safe to reach for it. it genuinely feels like life, for me and people like me, in this society specifically, is only granted to prove that hope truly is not viable and that our lives and our beings are merely stepping stones for the more lucky.i used to genuinely love people. deeply, unconditionally love people. i still do, but i hate to admit that because it makes me naive and open for hurt. and it extends to most all people, and before i could handle the fact that people are imperfect, that is fine, i can still handle that. i still feel that love for people in my life, even despite terrible low points. i have always been able to forgive, and distance, and move on if wronged. not wishing bad on those who wronged me. i still do not. but that changed these past few years. i went into a deep depression, and i still have not gotten over past trauma my dysfunctional family inflicted on me. that they still inflict. because i love them, and i forgive them and recognize what they did was wrong but i still care about them because we are all only human on this planet. there is always a reason and meaning, and people have good in them most of the time. if they do not expand it, i just distance but still wish for them to change and do what is best. so i distance, but the distance does not fix my mental state, or the distrust and pain that plagues me and my current relationships to others. i am secretive. i find that to be my biggest downfall. i never allow myself to be truly open, and i lock away deeply intimate parts of myself and the things i enjoy and love personally. i never share my writing, the things i enjoy most, or my media preferences. even though it is all harmless, i keep it under wraps, and i know it is due to trauma from my upbringing. i can link it distinctly. nobody would expect my death, and i know they would not because even my partner has no idea how debilitating my mental health gets. and it makes me angry, i feel burned. i am not able to be myself. i am not able to honestly connect with those in my day to day life. i was forced to hide most everything about me growing up, lest it be suppressed or judged harshly or used to hurt me. and i cannot do it anymore. i have lost so much of myself that i will never find those pieces again, to put myself back together whole. words are only a temporary distraction before it all comes down to crush me again. and, for that, i know that without the 24 7 distractions of other people and work and hobbies i cannot function. i am not whole on my own, mentally or physically, i feel. my cousin committed suicide 5 years ago and it is like a mirror and some days i envy them. i envy that they escaped, and i hate myself for even being capable of thinking that way. i feel like a hypocrite, for thinking of doing what i have begged and convinced others not to do.i am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. started taking care of a stray, now i have kittens to take care of as well. i cannot drive due to disability, which makes things harder, i feel too burdening on my partner. so i push myself into freelance work, up keeping everything to a high standard, never taking a break from videos or auditory outlets as i work, always distracting myself. but it is all a distraction, and i am wearing on them when they ask about what is wrong and i open up about my mental health or have anxiety attacks or mental breakdowns.""why are you like this why do you have to be like this?""""i cannot stay in this relationship if you cannot get better.""""why is something always wrong with you?""""cannot you do this later why do you have to do this right now?"" ""what the fuck do you expect me to do what the fuck is wrong with you now?"" and so i keep it all down, i suppress it, and i feel physically awful all the time. chronic migraines, i never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this, even as much as i love my pets and partner and family. i do not want to leave them but i feel i have to. i wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay, instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time, no matter how hard you try to forget it. when i get like that, being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. i really want to end it all, especially knowing that i will never have that. i have had that maybe a few times, and only after being torn down, only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. even then, they never learn a better way to handle it, or listen to me or care to remember when i try to get out what i need and how to handle the situation i say what my therapist has told me to tell others, it does not work because i guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain, relief at last, and then forget. then repeat. constantly. and i am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. i know if i passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. i do not want that to happen, i suppose, but i want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. though i also do love being sentient and conscious, i love listening and seeing and hearing new things. i love learning, and in this world and universe there is so much to learn, i could spend a lifetime doing so, even though i may not have access to formal higher education i have a phone and access to videos, lectures, news and studies. that might be worth sticking around for, but i only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. so why dwell in it and continue the distraction? even when i write this stuff, it makes me cry hard because towards the end i realize how much i enjoy life and living, and i realize how hard and near incapable i am of doing so fully. it makes me feel shattered and bleak. why even write it at all?it feels like i cannot even trust my own brain anymore. i already cannot trust it. why even go on if i cannot trust my own brain? i just want to be happy like i was before. i feel defeated",6
"over 12 years ago, i m had bad anxiety with random panic attacks. depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety, they went hand in hand. i went to therapy and a psychiatrist. i was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped. i have since moved far away from those doctors, have not been to therapy in years. i just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not. no one ever said to stop. but in the past year or two, my concentration has been getting worse and i felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro, it is been years. i had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so i knew about withdrawals and i had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one. i slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so. eventually, i stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on, brain zaps and all. i stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago. i have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro, always tired. i have been overall feeling myself. but i am still having some mental things. i am still finding myself having random moments of depression. just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things i enjoy as a waste of time. i try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary, thinking it could be the medication adjustment. the other weird thing is since i stopped the lexapro, i have had odd sexual side effects. like decreased sensation, weaker orgasm, not lasting as long, etc. i have never had this on lexapro, only one i stopped completely. this is starting to bother me and i am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10 years of lexapro.my main thing is, what do i do now? is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an ssri in general? i am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why i took it years ago in the first place. do i talk to a primary first? should i try therapy? go back on medication? or go to a psychiatrist first? the problem is i have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through md live and i see mixed reviews on that so i keep getting put off from trying it. also, not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who i should talk to about this.maybe someone out here went through something similar. i feel like i started with anxiety years ago and ended up with new problems and depression. not sure what to do next",2

"hi, 34 m here. posting this on my main because fuck it. this is who i am.i think i have been feeling this way for my entire life and, for a while, i was quite good at ignoring it. alcohol also really helped, but i successfully swore off that stuff two years ago and if i relapse and start boozing again i will be a lost because.they say drinking just makes your anxiety and depression worse. however, moving through life stone sober has just amplified my constant fear, hopelessness, self-doubt, and general apathy, and it getting worse. it is also incredibly boring. although, i do not find any non drinking-related activities interesting, and even if i did, i would probably make an excuse not to participate. i do not find any activities interesting.i do not have any friends, i do not have any hobbies, and i do not have any interest in doing anything. i cannot even focus on things i enjoy, so what is the point? my mind is so muddled by fear and anxiety that if i have to do something, i just try to get it done as quickly as possible so i can go back to doing nothing. while i am doing it, i second guess myself the whole time and pretty convince myself that i cannot do it. one the task is over, i feel no relief just disappointment and worry that i will probably have to do it all over soon after.i want to get better. i figured i would put this all out in writing tonight and then try to find a professional i can start seeing tomorrow.wish me luck... i am going to get better",2

"i found something out today that feels like the light at the end of the tunnel that id previously given up searching for. while i probably cannot end my struggles with the aid of therapy and medication trust me, my family and i have tried continuously to no avail , today i read that a man in quebec, who had a neurological disorder similar to alzheimers although he had not allowed it to progress to a stage wherein he became somewhat of a mental vegetable, he had lost many physical capabilities and securities and wore diapers at the end of his life qualified for medically assisted death under new legislation, when previously ones death had to be within the foreseeable future.at the end of the article it mentioned that while persons suffering from mental illness do not currently qualify under this legislation, they will as of 2023.that being saidits been a rocky road since 1999, but now it looks like i can finally be at peace with myself because there is now hope for people like myself, who found no relief in medication and therapy, for whom there previously was no hope. you do not have to struggle with the constant or not so constant thoughts of suicide and trips to the hospital that sometimes involve admission to the mental health wards. i feel like its overwhile i am referring to the struggle, i worry that the topic of this post might be a little strange and hard to understand, even for others who are depressed",2

"apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one, tl dr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. i am just having a bad night and found this reddit, so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice. amp my mental health struggles started when i was a kid, i was diagnosed with adhd and prescribed ritalin as well as told i should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. however, after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act from what i hear, a common complaint. unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so i have been dealing with that untreated for awhile honestly i am so used to it at this point that the symptoms i deal with i have always described is as not being able to make my head silent. are so ingrained as normal that i forgot about it for a long time. amp aside from that, i was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. however, things changed when i was ten. without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened the first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. it also left me with deep mental scars which i have been told is a form of ptsd. i still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks, even just riding does and as i am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world, especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. the second thing was molestation and rape, something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. it only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. my mother only found out a few years ago when i broke down about it - the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. this is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. depression, suicide attempts when i was younger, self loathing, hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it. amp to add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male, i felt like i could not even seek help for it for the longest time. the stigma is not as strong now ah days, though it does still exist, that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well, i am sure you get the picture. despite this i have seen doctors, i have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight, been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one. amp this brings me all the current day. despite all these issues i met someone who loves me. we got married recently. i have been happier then i had been in years, in all honesty she is the only person i have left anymore. my family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. but now that i have someone who depends on me as much as i do them...my mental state is getting worse. amp i still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. my self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because i cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. the more she tells me it is alright, the more she tells me i do not have the worry about it, the worse it gets. the majority of her family hates me because they think i am a lazy sack of shit. i try to talk to her about it but i end up just making her feel bad, like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. i feel like i am spiraling out of control, i feel like she would be better off without me. i just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. my mind is so twisted with what i think is happening and what is actually happening, i almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. i thought for awhile i was getting better but now i feel more afraid and alone then i ever have before and i am doing it entirely to myself and i do not know how to stop it.my life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point, this one little miracle happened to me and i am going to absolute shit over it. i need help. i need advice i need something. i am terrified to lose her. i am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. i just do not want to be alone anymore yet i feel like i am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.so if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tl dr ptsd, life long depression, adhd, all relatively untreated. managed to fall in love and get married. was happier. now it is all crashing back down and just...royally fucking with me. cannot drive, cannot get a job, feel completely alone and worthless. afraid to hurt the one person i love. cannot imagine what she sees in me. not sure what to do with my life anymore",2

"i have struggled with depression for a long time. i go through cycles of being good and then i slip back into a depression.. it can last anywhere from a few days to weeks to months. over the years i have learned how to identify when i am starting to slip into a depression. messier house, sleeping more, not caring about work even though i just got my dream job , not showering, not talking to people etc. but i do not know how to fix it. i deactivated my social medias today as well.. which i have never done. idk. its scary to feel the start of the downward slope and know you are going to end up in a hole you cannot climb out of. i am just kind of ranting but i just needed to get it out. i feel myself slipping",2
"i have tried it all. i have done the meds, i have done the therapy, i have done every healthy mindset exercise. i have done the morning jogs, the healthy eating. the gratitude journals. the lists of why life is good. i am fucking tired man. i first started questioning life at 7, now 16 years later i am tired. i do not get the ups and downs of life, its just a downward slope. and i am fed up of people telling me to just hold on in there etc. this new doctor will help, these new meds will ease it. mate i am so far gone i cannot hold on. i cannot do another ducking day like this. it does not matter if i even wanted to live anymore, i am so exhausted. and i am stuck, because i know if i go half my family will follow. that is all that is kept me here, but tbh i do not think i have got it in me to keep going. do not tell me to just keep holding on for help when i have been screaming for it for years, and you never cared to listen. so done with this bullshit",6
"lumps on neck and head now. okay so first of all thank you for reading this, i am struggling with bad anxiety right now. i have had two lumps on the side of my neck for 2 years now and have been told in the past by a doctor that they were nothing. i was put on antibiotics which didn't seem to help and sent away. i recently had them checked out again and the doctor ordered an ultrasound which i have yet to go to to make sure they weren't cancer. i have zero symptoms otherwise. fast forward to now i have a larger lump on the back left side of my scalp. i'm trying to tell myself it's just a cyst but the anxious pattern seeking side of me is having a hard time time letting it go. it's larger than the other two and is hard and hurts a little when i apply pressure. there are a few causes i can think of 1. it's just a cyst, and completely unrelated to my other two swollen lymph nodes. my fathet has a history of cysts, which may account for mine. 2. i'm pretty sure i remember hitting my head on something about a week ago, so it could just be a bruise of sorts. memory isn't clear 3. cancer. i'm gonna die, hit the panic button, ect... 4. i recently have been having allergies or a cold which could be due to an infection which could be making my lymph nodes react. this is the way my anxious mind sees it i must have cancer because there is now a third lump to add on the other two i've had for years. i've left it untreated for so long that i'm scared to even go to a doctor. now it must be spreading to my brain which would probably make it inoperable. i will get brain cancer and die at 19 due to my lack of action. i'm honestly having trouble deciphering hypochondria from reality. i'm hoping someone besides myself could make a determination as to whether or not i'm blowing this out of proportion. thank you. i'm also worried that in trying to niaevely make myself feel better by posting this.",0

"i think my bp is getting worse hi... i really need a space to express myself right now. i have had a bp diagnosis for just over 8 years. i was diagnosed at 18, and i stayed medicated until i was 22. however, when i was 22 i ended up homeless due to a conflict with my mother. i was having trouble getting my medication at the time, so i eventually talked to my doctor about weaning myself off my medication. he agreed that i was handling my symptoms very well, and that we could give it a shot. all was very well for the next unmedicated 3.5 years. however, just this year, i've been going through some noticeable changes. starting about 6 months ago, i settled into hypomania and dealt with it rather well. however, that hypomania, for the first time ever, developed into mania. i am currently enjoying the worst depressive episode i have ever had in my life - but i'm thinking it's a mixed episode because i am also irritable and experiencing impulse control issues. i've heard that bipolar can become more intense as you age, but i really didn't see this coming. i thought i was one of ""the lucky ones"" whose symptoms weren't severe enough to necessitate treatment and that i could use all the tools i learned in my many years of inpatient and outpatient therapy to stay on track. i do have an intake appointment for a local psychiatric care group lined up, but, for the first time, my symptoms are so bad that i'm having trouble working and doing day-to-day tasks. i have also noticed a lapse in memory, which really scares me. i can't bear to be around people because i don't want them to see me like this. and i'm scared i'll lash out at them before i can think twice. i know that i will ride this out. i know that everything that goes up will eventually go down and back up again. but right now, i would help to know that i'm not completely alone in this.",1

"bipolar amp traveling amp manic episodes amp foreign psych ward !! hi everyone. i wrote this about something i experienced last night kind of what happened to me in my first psychotic manic episode or whatever you wanna call it. did anyone else ever experience something like this? the sun was setting in the guatemalan western highlands as i used some of my precious battery life to check how far i was on the map on my phone. nearly three hours. traffic had slowed to a crawl, and i felt the tell-tale ticking of my anxiety rising in my stomach. this wasn t the plan, my brain told me. it was supposed to still be light when you got there. fear began to overwhelm me even though i had been in situations like this before. i had arrived only the night earlier in guatemala city close to midnight. it s days like this my recent diagnosis as being bipolar began to make sense. i thought i heard the woman with her child talking on the phone on the bus saying something about rubia, and fright overwhelmed me. i have become so scared of my own brain. in everything i do, i question what symptom of bipolarity is this? while in croatia last summer, i was relaxed, partying, and feeling like for once, i had come out of my shell i had become the person i was supposed to be. that bout of mania landed me in a croatian psych ward. when i stopped punishing myself for the sexual assault i suffered when i was four and began to allow myself to be happy, or so i thought, i had a psychotic break. i heard people talking about me. first, it was about how great i was, how cool, how pretty, and it was flattering. i felt on top of the world. then, i heard the other hallucinations. they were not so flattering. i spent a night in a hostel crying, while nearly 10 people in the same room tried to sleep. i felt terrible, but i couldn t stop crying. i was hysterical. my hallucinations had made me believe i had been raped, i had herpes, i was tainted and disgusting, and that i should probably kill myself because no one loved or cared about me. that night, i spent in my head. i didn t sleep, except for an hour, but then i was woken up by the hostel staff and asked to leave my reservation was only for one night. i wandered around the city and i felt like everyone was talking about me. i wanted to cry or sleep or escape, but i just didn t have the mental capacity to do any of it. i muttered and wandered. i felt so foggy, like there was a weight on my mind. why were people following me? why couldn t i see them? the next two days are kind of blurs in my mind, but i know i managed to leave all my belongings behind, including my glasses and my ability to see, have a delusion that i could speak every language i had ever heard a word of, and start to become aggressive. the next clear memory i have, i was waking up in a soft, warm bed. it was dirty all around me, and i felt so groggy and tired. i was in and out of sleep the whole day, waking up occasionally to eat a meal. there was a layer of grime and shame on me that a cold shower couldn t get off. all i wanted to do was curl up in that bed and become an invalid. the delusions were still there, but weaker. so, when this perfectly friendly, normal guatemalan woman was simply having a conversation with her mother, and i thought i heard words that might pertain to me, it freaked me out. i have a mantra i internalize when i am projecting my fears onto speech around me no one cares about you, no one is talking about you. it sounds pretty emo. but, when i thought, just for two minutes, this guatemalan woman was planning a way to rob me, it s extremely comforting. i went home after i ended up in the psych ward because clearly i needed to meet with psychiatrists and a whole host of doctors and a lovely therapist who would try to help me and have varying levels of success. throughout this process, my goal was to continue to travel by myself. i saw this as a hiccup. a pretty major hiccup, but one that s able to be overcome with a can-do attitude! it wasn t about or feeling like i had failed, but an urging from deep in my motherfucking soul that told me if i stayed in the relative warmth and comfort of my parents house now, i would never leave. that s probably a symptom.",1
"i made a brief post in another subreddit outlining the human condition, and the response i got was essentially my life is good, so fuck you.bluntness is met with indignation.most forums like these are populated l with personal anecdotes where attention, empathy, and especially solutions are sparse.its too late for me now anyway. i do not even know why i write anymore. why are we not allowed to accurately express the conditions of reality?",2
"i have everything setup. i am more ready than ever before.a little background couple of months ago i fell into the trap of abusing drugs. although i abused drugs i were never addicted and it was not hard at all to quit cold turkey. as easy it would be for most people to simply say 'no' to yourself when you have planned to have a 5 mile run the moment you see it is raining outside. however what really been tough for me is to break free from a very abusive relationship. it really sucks. trauma bonding, stockholm syndrome, whatever. that was like the battle of my life. but i finally got out and it felt pretty ok. but not anymore though. throughout the relationship i was gradually becoming more and more isolated from friends family and that is a thing i begin to understand now.been trying to rebound with old friends but nothing works. i also tried to seek help from them through this tough battle of breaking up, but none of them have reached out to me, not a single one. even though they know what i have been through. fuck it really hurts. anyways, this has truly damaged my self confidence to the degree where i cannot stand up for myself in any circumstances at all. the only one i actually had were my abusive ex, who of course did not like that i broke up. but since it were the only one i could talk to we kept meeting up at times. not a good idea. the abuse just continued. and if my self confidence was damaged before, it was completely ruined after this. i tried to talk to my family about it, but they refused to understand. guess they are all narcs psychopaths. i believe that is the reason i fell for my ex, who definitely have a lot of cluster-b personality disorder traits. it must be so, that i have people in my family with a cluster-b diagnose. therefore it were completely normal for me to be gaslit etc. however, my family believe i am 'just depressed'. that freaking hurt me like hell. fuck! due to this i.e. that my family believes i am depressed, i have noticed a lot of strange symptoms for me lately such as hard time falling asleep, emotionally numb, having strange smelly farts, being apathetic. i really think they are putting ssri in my food. i really believe so. 100 . but my lack of self confidence prevents me from confronting them about it. it really kills me slowly alongside the loneliness. the reason i eat the food they make is because i have no income at all and therefore no choice unfortunately. i guess i am just tired to live. it will be better for me to leave this world. rather than being depressed i do believe i have developed some sort of ptsd after this abusive relationship. living with ptsd cptsd truly sucks. being lonely truly sucks. the last person i had a conversation 1 hour with was my ex. roughly 2 months ago. it is time for me to leave this world. i wish you all the best and i know for a fact that you will survive this. always trust your gut. i failed on this and look where it got me. complete misery. good bye! i will do it tonight.",6

"not sure what to do so, my prior job turned extremely toxic back in november due to new management. it devastated my already shitty mental health. in january i couldn t take it anymore so i quit. i m 42 years old and i have a mortgage and i live alone with my dog. there s no money coming in and my house payment is 23 days late. i ve tried getting a new job, but due to my depression, i can barely make myself go to the mailbox and get the mail more than once per week. i ve only left my house once in the last 2 months. i ve had 2 interviews lined up but i couldn t make myself go. so, a couple weeks ago i had the idea to start a business. i failed to get any investors, so i said fuck it and started using my credit cards to buy the tools and equipment i need. i m currently just about out of money, and i m nowhere near ready to start the business. making and selling things, basically is the business model. i ve been really starting to feel the full weight of this decision and the pressure to not fail is insane. i don t know what to do if i fail. i ve had plenty of suicidal thoughts since back in november, but i was able to push them away. my dog and my dad he lives in another state and has health issues and he s pushing 80 are the only things keeping me from swallowing the old bottle of ambien in my cupboard, pulling my car into the garage, and just letting it all go. the part of me that wants to live is getting smaller everyday. i ve discussed all this with my therapist and one friend, but even then i have a habit of sugar coating things. i just don t know what to do. i feel broken and empty inside. out of nowhere i ll just break down and cry. i can t remember the last time i thought hey maybe things are gonna be ok . i guess that s the end of my rant. thanks for reading this far. take care, everyone!",2

"tw 3 nights ago, i wrote out a 6 page note and took a ton of pills. but somehow, i still woke up. i was exhausted and slept the day after and the day after but was fine today. no one but my therapist knows what happened. everyone in the house knew i was suicidal but they trusted me with my medication in my room i am chronically ill so there is a lot when they should not have. i have been trying to commit suicide since age 9 and that is not an exaggeration. i have tried so many times and it never worked. i even stepped in front a car to get run over. people always say it will get better or this too shall pass but it has not. i am 20 now, 11 years of feeling suicidal. i have never in my life felt more at peace than 3 days ago when i took those pills and left my notebook at the foot of the bed. i was relieved, i was happy that it was my last night. but it was not. i woke up. i wish i had those stories that i woke up or i was released from inpatient and i regretted it and i loved life. but i do not. there is so many times in my life where i think f , i really wish it worked i am spiritual and i think maybe my dad died when i was 12 will not let me die because he wants me to have a long life. or maybe god has bigger plans for me soon. maybe i am meant to be something, to do something. maybe i have a purpose in this world and i am needed down here. but i just cannot figure out what that purpose is. i just keep crying because frankly, i am mad. i am mad that i am being kept in this place that i am miserable in. i have wanted to go up and visit my dad and poppop and uncles and friends and everyone else i have lost but they do not want me. not yet. wishing it worked",6

"i 20nb get triggered so easily these days by people just living there lives. i feel so miserable in my own life and feel like i have not been able to grow or make lasting change in my life so seeing people my age or younger just doing it and living makes me so sad and insecure. i do not have a job, i did not go to college, i do not have my own place, my girlfriend left me for someone else, i am super mentally ill and its getting worse. i am constantly comparing myself to the people around me and wondering what is wrong with me why cannot i do the things they do why cannot people love me like they are loved even though i know comparison is the stealer of joy. i have been doing better mentally lately but i am still in this regressive fragile state and my brain feels like mush after everything i have been through the past few years. i just feel like shit about where i am in life and sometimes i feel like there is no hope that it will get better. i get so anxious about being an adult and having to step up and take care of myself i am paralyzed by fear. i feel so held back and it sucks to see other people outgrow you and live your dream. i feel like such a failure and a loser no matter how much reassurance i get. i hate the idea of being mediocre and living a mediocre life and that is all i am doing and it makes me just want to end things. i feel embarrassed of myself 24 7 and its just such a terrible feeling. seeing other people happy makes me suicidal",6

"i was born with meth in my system,my mom was going to abort me but my step-dad decided to intervene.my biological dad that i have never met was a depressive loser with a little dick and i inherited everything from him but his tallness.i grew up homeless essentially,we got to stay at my great grandmas house alot,but the majority of my childhood was spent in my step dads chevy k5 blazer.throughout my life i always moved,whenever i would make friends and gain a connection,we would leave,it left me numb and unable to form relationships, with the abject poverty and constant drinking,partying,domestic violence every night, and a mom that never hid anything from me, i had to grow up quickly. by 10 years old i had already told myself that i was ready to die, not that i wanted to,but i was ready.this made me really unrelatable to my peers,i acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.by my high-school years everybody thought i was a crackhead because i was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and i never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that i was a loner,but i am full of social desire.all this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,i am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument i revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.fast forward to now,i am 20 years old and i am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid. my mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disability,her constant drinking worries me.my 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went away,these last few years she has been following my mom's mold,smoking cigarettes,dropping out of school,doing nothing.i work 48 hours a week and when i come home i am 100 occupied by serving others, i have no future, no personality, no ambition, i do not even have my license yet,i am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanisms.i am fat and short,have an odd shaped body and just generally ugly, i have no redeeming qualities physically,i cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror,or work up the courage to find a gf and be loved,but i get awkward around girls i like and make things weird.i have no purpose.no place on this earth i bought really sharp knives on amazon, but i do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as i lie bleeding out,i am waiting to get a gun so i can just do a quick shot to the head and get i over with,no more bad thoughts,no more missing the countless friends i have left behind in the 30 schools i went to as a kid,no more pain, no more me. sorry,do not mean to give my life story,but i think it is relevant to why i do not want to breathe",6

"7.7.21should i kill myself?a long journal entry that mulls over the idea of suicide, why i was born, why i continue to live when its so easy to die, and why i am holding on even though most days i think about killing myself at minimum 4-8 times.i am tired of being around everyone that i lovei no longer find joy in the things i once cared for, and in general i am becoming a very bitter, mean person to be around.i was not always like this though, once upon a time i was just a small child who did not choose to be born, and i was busy dealing with an insane woman who would punch me in the head if the sky was the wrong shade of blueshe did not think she was doing anything wrong, because kids in other countries had so much less than we didshe never took the time to teach us about these things, because she was too busy yelling and avoiding being with us as much as humanly possiblebut i digressrecently, i have been lucky enough to find someone who loves me, and somehow i feel like i am fucking that up all the time toohe does not know how sad i am on the inside, because i do not trust him enough to tell himthats not on him, i just have never told anyone about the monster that lives in my heartits always there, just slightly off in the distance waiting for me to come and fall into its dark and comforting embrace and phwoo, its getting really hard not to wander over there and just fall off that cliffi tell you what boy, there is absolutely nothing like the darknessi have been there before and it is comforting, let me tell you whatbeing alive is hard, being in a relationship is hard, dealing with the world and hoping for people to get better is hardbut the darkness? holy shit no one talks to me in the darkness.no on interrupts me in the darkness, no one tells me my ideas are wrong or that the things i talk about will never workno one can hurt you in the darkness, no one except yourselfdamn what a choice.what a fucking choice.i am just sitting around being in pain all the time, and what your supposed to do is go to therapy but i have been to therapy, i have seen those peoplei was little, sitting in offices talking about how i was being abused and no one helped me then, so how am i supposed to trust these people to help me now?i do not fucking trust anybody, no one.not a doctor, not an expert in a field, not the people close to meyou cannot trust people because people are fucking insanos.my mother threw me down a cement staircase because she was mad that i ran away from home because i was afraid of her doing something craxy like oh, i do not know, throwing me down a cement staircasemy dad fucking walked out, told me he was going to be with his new family because being with me was too difficult, and then showed up almost 8 years later to let me know i was a failure and i was not trying hard enoughbecause i was lying about my grades, because all the people in my house were abusive and terrible people. but he dint know that, because he had, again, been gone for about 8 years.so i digress, but if these two dna donors cannot be trusted, how the fuck am i supposed to trust anyone elsethe only person i ever trusted, my grandma, is long since dead.and honestly, i have a harder time every day keeping myself alive instead of killing myself and going to hang out with herlike, people spend their whole lives thinking they will go to paradise, they will go to heaven. they put all their faith in people that live in the fucking sky.i met my grandma bitch, i know she was real.i remember her rubbing my back with an egg to take all the pain away, and here my dumbass is 10 fucking years later, with 10 years of pain built up in my back and my soul and my heart because i do not have anyone to rub an egg on me anymore to make me feel betterso what the fuck manhow do i keep goinghow am i supposed to keep walking this walk when all the time i look outside and i just want to go nope and throw myself off the rooflike i am supposed to be worried about people missing me i guarantee you everyone will be just fucking fine if i am gonelike, everyone close to me at this point has only known me for 3-5 years, definatly not long enough to give more than 2 shits about 2 months after i am deadso yeah. i am having a reeeeeeeeeeeeeeallly hard time finding reasons to stay alivelike, for what?so i can watch everyone i love succumb to the disastrous effects of climate change?

"i feel like im becoming stupid hi, i've suffered from health anxiety for a few years now, but it's starting to drive me crazy. i started getting terrible headaches a few months ago, it eventually got so bad that i had to go to the hospital and get a ct scan. they said there was nothing wrong with me. i continued to get headaches and i constantly felt like i was going crazy. i went to a chiropractor and was told that all of my pain is coming from my neck and my back, and for some reason i still feel like there is something wrong with my brain. i just recently started having trouble reading, the best way to describe it is that it's like i'm stuttering when i'm reading, i'm constantly reading stuff and not being able to understand what i just read, and then reading it again and realizing that i missed a few words or completely replaced a word with another word. i'm trying to avoid reading because its causing be to become extremely paranoid. i feel like i'm becoming less intelligent or becoming brain dead or something. i'm slowly starting to go crazy and i don't know what to do. i'm probably going to get an mri just to prove to myself that there is nothing going on with my brain. i really scared and i don't know what to do.",0

i studied psychology in undergrad. been trying for 2 and a half years to get into grad school. 4 rejections because i am dumb as fuck and have no utility in the real world. i have been working as a case manager for the past 2 years being an underpaid personal assistant for the chronically mental ill along with uber driver. i have a case load of 28 i am expected each week to ensure the client is able to navigate his or her diagnosis.. fuck i have lost hope in mental health all together next time you meet with your therapist recollect that all he or she does is reflect your thoughts and affirm your shitty decisions that lead you in to this place all together.. have you met any one in mental health field that is actually happy because its been 2 years and i have not met a soul who is not a fucking coward or in it for milking the insurance. or who actually fucking cares about science. where does that me. a person who lies in the diagnosis of being depressed but does not believe a word they say because its all subjective sjw bullshit..what if i want to identify myself as a depressed man who drinks 8beers a day and smokes weed until my thoughts are so far gone that i would not even recall them when i am sober. what if that makes me fucking happy. you feel great satisfaction the feeling that beer gives you yep i sure do. idk this a rant from the most raw feeling that can express. i just want to make a difference and help people. but i cannot even help myself. what kind of adumb fuck wastes 4 years of his life to study a topic that pays so little and exposes you to daily traumas and countless victims of the universe.fucking victims everywhere get over yourselves your going to fucking identify as depressed and anxiety ridden even though you did not have to storm the beaches of normandy or die huddled in a gas chamber because of your religion or face persecution in any other way except for your ego to get bruised a bit because you are to fucking stupid to come up with a rational argument to yourself of why you are not fucking worthless. act like your fucking with something because its not going to matter to anyone else but yourself. you suffer because you desire. you desire to feel something different than what you feel daily. maybe the only thing to do is bear the suffering and bear the burden for other people. i am going to do the best i can believe that is the only thing i can do. this was no filter typing. i believe in you all just do me a favor and do not claim to be a victim own your shit.much love fuck it,2
"twhello reddit!for context, i am a 19 year old woman. i have been struggling with a host of mental problems since early childhood, including diagnosed bipolar disorder, ptsd, anxiety, and years of various eating disorders. when i was 17 years old, i was hospitalized following an attempt to take my life. i hated my time there, and managed to get myself let out after a week. i was better, a lot better for a while after that. i was better than i would ever been i was regularly taking my meds, i was social, i was practicing my hobbies, i worked 40 hours a week and still felt excited to take on the world. it lasted for a good 2 months, until i had a bout of mania wherein i spent all of my money, abused a hell of a lot of substances, and basically destroyed my life from the inside out. by the end of it, i felt like a she will and fell into a deep depression. i have always experienced panic attacks, normally stemming from my ptsd, if i had to guess. as a child, i was abused in several ways and am now unable to be around people who are yelling without nearly bursting into tears. i also break down when there are sudden, loud noises. for example, a coworker was washing dishes the other week and i was behind her collecting a few items to stock i work at a coffee shop. she dropped a metal tray into the metal sink on accident, and it made a very loud crash i was not expecting it, and my breath just left my body. i broke down in tears, and could not stop crying until my shift ended about 3 hours later. this sort of thing happens fairly often, and it just seems to be happening more and more as time goes on. sometimes during these ""tantrums"", as i call them, i injure myself. usually by hitting myself in the head with objects until i fall to the ground in tears, holding my head from the pain. or i break things. or i say incredibly harsh things to my family. it makes me feel so awful and guilty after the fact i just have no regard for anyone it seems. aside from the tantrums, which i have given up on trying to control, i also find it impossible these days to keep any positive thoughts. i cannot even be happy for others i feel bitter and angry when hearing of others' successes. which leads to more guilt. i am a bitter, terrible person and i just do not know how i can fix it at this point. i have all of these emotions that i cannot control, and everyday it just gets harder and harder. this whole post has turned into a jumbled mess i am sure, but i do not have the energy right now to proof read it. i am sorry. the further i go on, the older i feel, and the less control i seem to have over my life and emotions. i just feel like i have no footing and nowhere to go, and living with this mindset, i have no idea how long i can last. i do not want to die, i just cannot see myself going much further like this. medication and years of therapy have done nothing. i am not really sure if i am posting this for advice or just to get my thoughts out there, but thank you to anyone who reads it. and i wish you the best. lt 3 i am not sure how much longer i can go on like this.",2

"i had 2 friends. i knew we were drifting apart and i was trying by myself to make the friendship work. well once again, life has happened and they have proven yet again that i am not important to them.a tornado hit my area like a week ago. i texted one of my friends and asked him if he was okay since he lives further up the coast. he said he was fine. i told him i was really scared and i never heard back from him again.fast forward to the day before yesterday. my last remaining grandma died unexpectedly. my head is messed up and so is my heart. i just needed some support. i texted my other friend who ghosts me regularly and was trying to joke and make small talk. he said now is not a good time. my sadness has turned into anger. i am absolutely fucking pissed. i did not ask for shit other than some companionship. yet they discarded me like i was a fucking piece of garbage! i hate the both of them. i hate them. i hate myself more for even thinking they were my friends. i cannot believe i stuck around for 6 amp 7 years for it to end like this. i fucking hate them so much. all i am seeing is red. why???",2
"what is or isn't a panic attack? hi folks, i have been diagnosed with gad last year and still am discovering recognizing all the different symptoms i have. thank you for this wonderful community btw, i have cried at many of your stories and small victories. i was wondering what your panic attacks anxiety attacks feel like, and what difference you make between the two? i keep telling therapists ""oh no i don't have panic attacks"" because in my mind if i'm not passed out on the floor then it's not it, but also i do have attacks of accute stress rapid heart beat can't breathe need to move and get the f out of where i am which i don't know how to qualify. looking for your experiences so i can put words on what i go through stay strong",0

"first week on lamictal and it's giving me memory problems. does it ever end? i started meds for the very first time last week and i'm really excited for the future. my doctor gave me lamictal and it's great. i can tell its already working because i'm not getting extremely depressed or extremely manic, i feel balanced. but i'm getting really bad memory problems and it's to the point where i drive and forget where i'm going. currently i'm taking one 25mg per day and tomorrow i will have to take two pills each day and work my way up until i have to take 100mg per day. i definitely love the effects but the side effects are frustrating. has anyone had any experience with this? did it ever go away?",1

"i mean i have literally considered myself borderline asexual for the past few years. i have not had any desire for romantic relationships, i masturbate like twice and year and rarely ever get horny either. in fact i find it and gross and annoying when other ppl are horny or talk about sex. i literally do not resonate with anyone anymore. it makes me sad tho, i feel like i am losing all my humanity and i deserve to feel pleasure lol has anyone just lost their sex drive due to depression?",2
"can you be deeply in love with 2 people at the same time? so there's this guy. an ex ss officer. he fell in love with a jewish prisoner in auschwitz and had a relationship with her. after the war he tried to contact her to be with him, but she wanted nothing more to do with him, so he started a new life, family, got married . he had this one picture ofher in her auschwitz prisoner uniform , and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing, away from auschwitz. he used to do this for the most of his life the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have had .he copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died. so when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this jewish girl, and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that. he even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex jewish girlfriend, not her mother. his daughter said it was odd, and she also said that this jewish girl was the love of his life in a documentary, there was a documentary made about them . so the filmmaker which is close to both his and jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this jewish girl, till the day he died. his wife also knew about his ex.so in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity, and his ex jewish girlfriend was a witness,when he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry. does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more? does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her?",5

"okay, i do not even know how to express my feelings but i will try. i have been lied to in my life by being told if i would work hard and get a good job i would be happy.this cannot be further from the truth. i am deeply upset. something about me i am short and an ugly man nope do not even try to tell me otherwise i once posted on one of those am i ugly subs and i got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1 .okay, so my problem is still that i get made fun of and i am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. but i want to talk about more to be honest.men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that i could do about it because i am immediately met with ""what are you going to do?"". hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if i would be called napoleon, if i will joke back then i would be called arrogant and if i will listen to insults or jokes as people call it i would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.i am surprised that men just laugh when i mention my height, they are like ""oh i just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if i have worked less than them my entire life and as if i do not deserve it. i cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. so i quietly take insults till i can and after that threshold which is just over, i will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. oh and please i am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. on the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""nobody owes you anything"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. if somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? what would you do? well i would go and help that person not because i owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. if you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""oh gee i do not owe you anything""now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that i have ever seen, i get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but i would date you insert physical characteristics but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". well i have not found anyone and not only that i even asked them after getting rejected ""if you do not mind me asking what do you think i should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" and you can pretty much guess what i get told.although i am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when i approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, i mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. pro tip if you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.and not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out i am becoming what i hate, i hate people who show no emotion, i hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. but now i do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because i know when i would need help nobody would be there for me.not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts i can link the study of you folks want .you know what, i am frustrated at the fact that i cannot let my angry out, i am angry at the fact that i cannot be upset because then i would be insecure.i am tired of pretending i am not upset, i am tired of pretending that i laugh your jokes. i do not. i am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending i am too cool to get hurt.. i am tired of pretending that i am comfortable in my body because i am not. i did not chose to be this way. i do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. i am tired of pretending that i do not get crushes after 23 consecutive nosi wish somehow i could show the world and tell them that i am a human too. i feel bad. everytime you make fun of me i feel stripped of my humanity. and i am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and i have been told by those people that i put effort in on putting effort. and those people who say it are always good looking.i am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. is it so bad that i want to feel loved and wanted. shit my own parents made fun of me.i am tired of pretending i am comfortable i am not. i have no zeal none at all to live. tired of being belittled constantly.",6

"today is the death anniversary for my nephew. we lost him to a tragic drowning accident 9 years ago. he was two when he passed away and i was the only one in my family that ever got to meet him and be with him. i helped my sister raise him for the first few months of his life. it is hits me soo hard every single year. it never gets easy. usually around this fine i have mt bestest friend that i have known since i was 18, would be here to talk with me and keep mt head sane. sadly it is been 2 year on the 20th that i also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away. last year i ended up coming off the deep end, being the first year i did not have her to be the ground i needed. this year does not feel much different. all i want to do is see his face again and hear her voice. i do not want to break down, i do not want this year to be like every other year but i already have not slept in days. all i can think about is all the people i have lost and how i need them now more than ever. i just want them back. this is the week i struggle the most.",2
"ever since i got off my meds... i started developing fears, first i got really claustrophobic to the point where my dad exchanged an rv we bought because i couldn't sleep in the bunk beds due to panic attacks there were also other reasons for the exchange, main ones being the need for more space and storage , and now, i've developed a fear of the dark. i got used to just leaving the light on in the hallway if i got too scared, but today, i went to bed without the light, and looked out of my door i'm used to sleeping with it open , and saw these stick figures and i'm telling you it scared the shit out of me, i literally felt my heart drop thankfully, it stoped after a few seconds of terror, turning on my phones flashlight pretty much saved me . now that i'm thinking about it, it might be due to the fact that i haven't slept in 36 hours. but ultimately, i feel like living is hard enough without me being constantly in fear of things that i know aren't real but my stupid brain still won't let go of. also, my doctors know i'm not taking my meds anymore, it was my doctors plan to get me off them slowly, i just kinda skipped the whole getting off your meds slowly part and went cold turkey. i guess i just needed to vent.",2

"for anyone on the fence about journaling, this is my experience so far... so i enjoy journaling for a few different reasons, and as i continue to do it, and get better at it, the more natural it feels, allowing you to really make use of it and get something out of it. before this recent journaling expedition i had never journaled. maybe stupid little doodles and quotes from songs or something in notebooks, but not really journaling, or for any real purpose. i was somewhat curious and interested in the idea, as it had always been suggested to me by programs, institutions, therapists, etc.. however, i couldn't get past my biggest hurdle which was how to begin journaling without feeling really, really, silly, or like some teeny girl in highschool writing about people she doesn't like or her crushes or whatever. it just felt awkward and silly. i debated on doing it for a while and i think one day i said to myself to just do it, see how it goes, and do it day after day or just twice a day, even if all i write is a sentence, or a gratitude, or a to do list, the idea was just to start doing it and developing the healthy habit. so my first entries were very crude. i'm looking at one now and it basically says thc nj is cool apply to jobs start new rpg gonna cook steak start reading do androids dream of electric sheep? finished it that week this is my 1st time journaling may add more later, lol talked to lily billy, need to more often then l stated a short gratitude for the day. this first journal entry i was grateful for reddit, cause i believe i made a post prior to writing that entry asking for tips on how to journal. i posted on a few mental health groups, a few addiction or drug based subs, and a few writing subs and got all sorts of helpful tips, but my first few entries remained pretty crude for a week or so. my first entry was on 2-12-23. so i've been doing it almost daily, some days multiple times in one day, and some weeks i'll go 3 or 4 days without journaling like just recently, but i don't like doing that cause now i notice a sort of disconnect from myself when i don't journal habitually. it's constant confirmation of all your thoughts and beliefs, and you see how your idea develop and progress. thinking something and thinking something then writing it down on paper, physically putting the idea into the universe helps establish it. i skip a week or so into my journaling and now i'm talking to it more like how traditionally people think journaling goes. like raw free thought sort of, that's definitely a very important part of journaling though you can and will develop your own entire journaling style based on your needs, or what you want out of it. i thought i would hate the free thought aimless formula but it's what i use the most now, because the habit of writing allowed me to get comfortable with it and explore it's benefits. i just moderate it by usually including short term, or long term goals, gratitudes,or something. but not always, if you don't feel it you shouldnt force yourself. you don't wanna say a bullshit gratitude just to write something for gratitude. if you don't feel it don't write it. so yeah fast forward in my journal and i'm talking about the day we went to the park after group and we smoked a bit and played football and frisbee and saying how nice it is, before that some goals and gratitudes. short term goals. i begin to write about accomplishments i've made and things i see different in myself. i talk about some of my inner growth but i'll mention a specific think like in how the past year and a half i've been fucked up like 20 of those days. or how i feel my brain is finally begin to repair itself cause i can feel some sort of natural euphoria at times. dopamine release is finally becoming more regulated. i'll write how i finished a book in a week and that's also an accomplishment. a big accomplishment i had to write down was hygiene. when i was in heavy active addiction, or even sober just severely crippled with depression i'd go a month without brushing my teeth, weeks without showering. so i wrote down that accomplishment. it effects self esteem, ego and confidence. when you go back and read goals you had and accomplishments you've made, on a daily basis you get to physically see growth or change in yourself instead of just feeling you're doing better. you have written proof, you're logging your mental state everyday and you go back after a month when you forget what you wrote and you're like oh shit wow, i can't believe i actually accomplished that, or shit i can't believe i even wanted. to accomplish that. being able to go back and read what you wrote after you forgotten it is a visceral feeling. theres no real way to journal and i'm still figuring out my best way but it changes, some days it's free thought, one day it's lists and goals and gratitudes, sometimes a healthy mix, sometimes it's something funny that happened that day good to go back and read on funny moments you'd otherwise completely forget about, it can immortalize them so to speak sometimes it's topics i wanna go down rabbit holes on youtube and i'll mention it in the journal so that if i forget i'll come back to that page on my own at some point and remember. i could imagine how amazing it would be to have years worth of your own personal journals now. must be pretty fucking cool. get to see huge change in yourself and never forget where you started. reddit gave me an overwhelming amount of good information and i took what i thought would work for me, still plan to read more on journaling tips soon as i wanna evolve it further and do more for with it, but i've been doing it for a like a little over a month so ill keep learning and adding journaling objectives as i continue doing it. all in all journaling serves to strengthen your relationship with yourself. i know my explanation wasn't the best, so i recommend also searching reddit or google on your own for more journaling tips that work for your needs. the end.",2

"so some back story, my sister has always been my best friend. we have both struggled with mental health our whole lives and while i am starting to balance out she seems to keep getting worse and worse. we had been loving together with me supporting her with maintaining the household cleaning and it exhausted me. i got to the point where i no longer see her as my friend and it hurts.... i am at a loss with her, she does not seem to want to get to get better, will not take responsibility for the stressors she puts on herself, ex. she wants to emotional spend and then cannot afford bills and needs help. the most recent thing happened was she is not a clean person, and she never has been. i moved out of the house and across the state. i recently went back and walked into what can only be described as a pre hoarders situation. i fed her cats and one did not come down. i was genuinely concerned it might have died in the mess. i finally broke down and sent a picture of her bedroom to my mom. i finally told her that i failed her and could not keep up with my sister. i did not how else to help her. my dad reached out and apparently told her to either clean up or move out. the house was owned by my parents and i was taking care of it for them while they were out of the country. i went back this weekend and her room looked a ton better. my sister however told me if i ever tattled again then she would go no contact. i respect her decision but how do i show her that being supportive is not always coddling? that i want her to get better but i am at a loss for it. i have tried helping her clean, suggesting different coping methods and she always replies that she is too depressed to do anything about it. i just feel like she is perpetuating her own condition and it is breaking my heart. i am one step away from going no contact because it is hurting me so much. i know that this would not be the answer because of her health. i just feel like such a failure. i am about to lose my sister",2

"childhood i just found this group recently, and it got me thinking. i feel like i was always this way, but it doesn't make sense to me that someone would simply be born this way. one of my first memories was standing behind my parents, and somebody asked them, ""what is wrong with him?"" to which they responded, ""oh, he is just shy."" in the first grade during story time, i would face against the wall 2 feet away from everybody and just daydream. never joining in, but according to my mom, my teacher found it cute, so she never said anything. i found it embarrassing at the age of 7 when someone would call their parents ""mommy and daddy."" i would sit with the kids that bullied me during lunchtime because i desperately wanted them to accept me. up until high school, i would constantly go to the nurses office trying to act sick so i could leave, and at the very least be able to laydown for sometime. from middleschool to highschool i found my way to kinda fit in which was through humor, gained a lot of attention but i only felt like i had 2 real friends this entire time. even though id spend countless nights crying thinking those friends really hated me any girl i liked in highschool i would never pursue because i didnt think i deserved them. im sure everyone here did this though. since the focus is on childhood, im going to stop here, but i just find it interesting how, for me, it seems i was always like this. how is it that in early development, someone can be so self-conscious?",4

"my life has pretty much been a downward spiral for 10 years now, ever since i permanently injured my right shoulder in gymnasium european equivalent of high school .the injury is what started it all, but as time passed, my depression gradually grew into what it is today, in the beginning it was only negative thoughts about my injury, but as time passed and the negative thoughts got worse, they started seeping into every aspect of my life, until negative, downright self deprecating thoughts became the norm.i no longer feel like i am actually living my life, it feels like i am just going through the motions, most days i just feel numb and i cannot remember what it is like to wake up and be excited about the day ahead. but just to be clear, i have accepted that i do not have it in me to kill myself, but if i am going to continue living, i do not want to continue down the self destructive path i am on. as for the lying part. as of writing this, i am completely broke, on the verge of being kicked out of my apartment and i was kicked out of my university for inactivity 2 months ago and after having studied for 4 years, i am actually happy that i do not have to study anymore, since enrolling was just a thing i did, mainly to have a community to be a part of, but it did not help me and the stress of constantly studying, just added to it all.my family do not know any of this and i have been too scared to tell them all this, but now i have reached a point where i do not care anymore and am actually considering telling them about it all. also because they keep asking me about my studies and my life in general and i just cannot keep lying about it anymore, i cannot keep track of the lies and it is tearing me apart, that this is what my life has become. i am mainly considering telling them, because i have come to the conclusion that i cannot get out of this myself and that i need help. no matter what plans i make to lessen the feeling of hopelessness they all amount to nothing, as the crushing hopelessness of it all, makes it hard must any energy to do anything but just drift along with whatever happens. i am considering just telling my parents about it all, so i do not have to lie about my life anymore.",2

"disclaimer i don't intend to bad-mouth mirtazapine here, its side effects and somewhat ""dulling"" effect on the mind for some people during the first few months has likely been discussed enough here. some feel nothing at all, others feel like zombies. totally individual. i trust and maintain that the benefits of proper use, together with conversational therapy, is very efficient for many people, and i hope this has been said on this sub. i feel a need to share my own experience, though, in the hopes that it will be of some help to someone who might be reacting the same way as i did to mirtazapine's well-recorded increase in appetite.",3

"she never disclosed any of this to me, and probably never would have if the embassy hadn't discovered it first. in her words, she was afraid i would lose all interest in her if i found out she was married before. truth be told, i likely would have, as i was still young when we first met. she claims she left that husband because of the abuse she received from him and his relatives still lived with his parents . i was crushed at that time, as we had only been married for about a month.",3

"sorry to sound pathetic... its how i am made to feel when i vent. i got drunk, blacked out and od.. woke up in the psych ward basically. i convinced them with lies that i was never suicidal to begin with and lying drank because its out of character for me. i am back to the self voice and obsessive thoughts of doing the same thing with something that would actually work. i suppose my trigger is the therapy session yesterday with my sex addict husband to do martial counseling. it brought forth everything i feel and its all overwhelming me at once. i cannot handle it. it may make me a weak person but fuck it, i already had issues with bipolar disorder among other things before he dragged me again and again through this for the last ten years. i have loved a she will and it was all a lie. sigh i am rather impulsive and i just act. it will be sudden, no note. god help me, i just want it all to end no matter how. od'ed last month and back to feeling close to that edge again",6

"i miss my home, but my home is destroyed, i am from a small town in venezuela, the president of the country set regulations for everything on the basis of socialism, what ended up happening was that private companies could not produce and make a profit while selling at the prices the government forced them to, there is no toilet paper, no rice, no pasta, no toothpaste, no food, you cannot buy bread because there is no flour, the only companies producing are the companies the government took and they can afford to sell at those prices since they are subsidized by the oil prices, and as you can imagine, they often fluctuate, this crisis caused over 5.4 million venezuelans to leave the country since the so-called ""revolution"" started, current politicians cannot travel to the us because they are investigated for their relations with drug cartels, i grew up in a city where i used to see every week trucks loaded with dead bodies of people who would try to go to the mines for gold and would get murdered in there as this is a territory controlled by the military which can do whatever they want since they are backed up by the government which gets their cut of the gold and diamond supply,it hurts me how some people in the country where i live is deeply convinced we have everything in venezuela or talk greatly about our president when i have friends who were murdered or incarcerated for literally twitting against the regimen, if you are wondering why we do not protest like cuba is doing right now, a little history lesson for you, every time we do it, the president sends the military to murder us, the internet is loaded with pictures of this, to give you one example of the most brutal one, we had this member of the military who tried to reveal against the government, his name was scar alberto prez, they tracked him down and killed him with a rocket launcher, yes, you read that right, they threw a missile to the hose where he was staying with woman and kids. usa, canada and other countries imposed sanctions on the politicians about 2 years ago freezing their assets and bank accounts, and people all over the internet talks about how the usa is doing bad to venezuela, this drives me nuts, if you know anything about the venezuelan history, at least respect our country by realizing that chavez and maduro have done more damage to us than the usa has. we do not see a light at the end of the tunnel,it is hard to see the place where you grew up to go from the promised land to complete decadence. i miss my home, but there is no more home, my story as an immigrant from venezuela.",2

"personality or hypomania? i feel like how i tell about my life to my psychiatrist influence my possible diagnosis. i'm currently in the middle of diagnosis for bipolar 2. i got already medication lamictal even though i didn't yet get a official diagnosis, since at psychiatrist appointment we didn't have enough time to go through all the diagnosis criteria, and if my sympotoms fit in to those. with psychiatrist we've been going through my possible hypomanias but specially been focused on one which was the most severe one. during this period i broke up with my boyfriend do not regret it , had a huge crush before breakup, slept with the person i had a crush few days after breaking up, felt really happy and energetic, got involved in politics, slept 5h a night usually 8 h , got in an out of situationships, went to parties, told everybody how beautiful i am usually i'm not happy with my body . my psychiatrist didn't ask on my drug use but i've realized that before this episode or in the beginning of this episode i took some psychedelics. i really don't want drug use on my medical records since i've been sober for a year now. does anybody else have any feelings on drug use on their medical records? if i tell my psychiatrist i have taken illegal drugs before the episode i might not get the diagnosis. but then again i suffer from mood swings and cyclic severe depressions. i don't know anymore what is my normal state and if i exaggerate my possibly hypomanic symptoms. i've had other hypomanic episodes as well. in one i had for few weeks i moved in with a guy for a month who i'd known for two days, didn't fly back to home even though covid-19 restrictions were starting, posted dancing videos on instagram, said i love you to the person i was living with, had unprotected sex. but again this person was very manipulative and was gaslighting me, love bombing, and getting mad for me moving out. i feel like my psychiatrist could very easily misdiagnose me since my hypomanias might be caused some other things such as drugs or manipulation. how do you feel, is hypomania something that can't be caused by other factors in your life? whole my life, i have been doing impulsive decisions like gotten three tattoos at once my first ones , brought flight tickets for next day, traveled by myself, applied to new schools, cheated, went to strip club not normal to me , had hookups. on all of these i've had regrets as well. i don't know what is my personality and what not. if i tell my psychiatrist that these actions were not normal to me then i probably get the diagnosis. but also i do these things so regularly that maybe those are charasterictic to me.",1
"original comment was in french. shitty translation by me.the problem would first come from people that would be manipulated, and that would go kill themselves because of the pressure coming from an evil-minded entourage. then, things always end up getting better, and a suicidal person by definition cannot realise that, giving an easy way for someone to kill themselves would necessarily increase suicide rates. suicide is not a right, it is a selfish act whose consequences are dramatic for the victim's entire entourage, but not for the victim themselves. i have never heard about a suicide that would have made anyone happy, even for the victim, woe will always be better than nothingness.woe will always be better than nothingness. i cannot explain how those words are straight up cruel. people want you to suffer rather than not existing. those words are going to stick with me for the longest time. an unwelcome haunting.this is a sick world we live in. i wonder what impact this piece of shit was thinking his bullshit would have on me and other suicidal people. how can you tell that to someone suffering? how insane, how cruel do you have to be?who are truly the selfish ones? who the fuck are they?but this is only a reflection, a foretaste of our entire society. i could never again bring myself to believe, even one second, in anyone's goodwill. humanity is devoid of such thing. it is only cold and hostile. this is something someone replied to me as i was ranting about how suicide should be a right. this is why we can never talk about our struggles. this is why we can only withdraw into ourselves and die in a hidden corner, like agonising cats.",6

"hi! today i feel like typing until i feel better somehow....i am currently 25 years old and life has not been easy at all. struggles all the time and i guess everybody goes through some issues during their lifes and its ok.my mom was 18 when i was born, she did not finish high school and got married with the guy that i am supossed to call father. he was into drugs, so he got my mom into them as well... like that they had 4 more children, and we all live under the same roof, in a small room, at a hotal room that of course my parents never pay and just run away ... or anywhere we could stay. i was such a baby but still i remember some of the places we used to live and it was not good at all...many things happened during the 7 first years of my life, mostly horrible things but here i am... my parents got so into the drugs and all so they became criminals and wherever we used to live, people knew and got afraid of them, some parents used to tell their children to not hang with me and my brothers, and at that time i did not understand what was going on but now i do.so after that, when i was 7 years old, my grandparets decided to take us 5 4 brothers and i to live with them and get a better life. they have given us education, a place to live, a family, experiences, everything... i cannot complain about the lifestyle they provided to us because it was all good but there is a dark side of the story.we have been living with my grandparents 18 years now, and i have not seen my parents in all this time. its ok i guess... but i wish i could take out so many things i have inside my head and my heart in order to feel better. i am not happy and i feel that i have not been happy ever. i want to know what would be like to have a happy life at least for few days...i should stop it now, its just making me cry and all... well, thank you to anyone who reads this. if nobody reads it its also ok. hi!",6
"os ltimos trs dias eu ando sentindo uma bad to profunda e eu no entendo, eu no tenho motivos pra estar triste eu deveria estar sorrindo mas no estou e isso me deixa mais triste. eu sinto um vazio to grande no peito que me falta ar pra respirar, eu no sei oq eu fao, s consigo pensar them uma nica soluo, toda vez que me deito no consigo dormir, a mente cheia de pensamentos que no me do um minuto de paz e olha eu aqui escrevendo pro nada e pensando them tudo, tenho uma dor enorme guardada e eu no consigo dividir isso com ningum, eu at tento, grito por ajuda mas ningum percebe o sorriso na minha cara no e mais verdadeiro e eu quero que fosse como antes, tenho pensado demais e isso t me corroendo por dentro, no sei quanto tempo eu aguento mas as coisas no melhoram, passo dias sem comer pois no sei oq eu sinto, no sei diferenciar fome da solido, tenho chorado demais, todos os dias pra ser exato, me olho no espelho e no gosto do que vejo a expresso de um rosto sem esperana me deixa ainda mais angustiado, espero que tudo se resolva, espero que seja logo.... ou ser tarde demais para mimhj foi um dia tedioso, no tinha oq fazer s queria conversar com ela mas parece que ela no queria falar comigo, eu no entendo o pq disso me abalar tanto ao ponto de me deixar triste e pra baixo, no era para as coisas serem assim. a cada dia que passa me sinto trocado, mas a real que eu nunca fui escolhido ento no faz diferena. o pior que eu no sei pq ela no fala comigo e minha cabea agitada no me deixa dormir them paz, mais um dia que eu no consigo dormir pensando nela, antes fossem coisas boas, mas esse sentimento de perder algo que eu nunca tive me destri por dentro. pensei que era recproco essa necessidade um do outro, mas parece que eu no a cativei ainda e ela deve me enxergar como qualquer outro garoto.mais um dia que no consigo dormir, pensar na vida tira meu sono, pensar nela tira meu sono, pensar them mim tira meu sono ento por que eu penso, hoje entrei them completo vazio existencial, pq as pessoas se aproximam de mim sendo que eu no sou suficiente nem pra mim mesmo. eu tento disfarar que estou bem mas no estou a cada dia que passa eu me afastou de mim mesmo, j no sei o que estou me tornando, as vezes no silncio da noite quando estou apenas comigo mesmo penso no por que de eu ainda estar vivo, me fizeram uma pergunta uma vez "" o que te faz feliz?"" e o engraado que at hj eu no descobri, at hj eu no sei o motivo que me faz sair da cama todos os dias, o motivo pelo qual eu estaria disposto a morrer. e eu sinto que se uma pessoa ainda no descobriu pelo qu morreria, ela ainda no est pronta para viver e nesse pensamento eu no me vejo mais entre os vivos, talvez seja uma forma de acabar com meu sofrimento, sofrimento pelo qual eu no sei o motivo mas ele s vem e vem causando uma dor tremenda no meu peito, as minhas expectativas de que as coisas iam melhorar diminuem a cada dia que passa, o pior que ainda tem ela, que me faz bem porm eu no sei se eu seria capaz de ama-la j que nem mesmo me amo.eu no sei se eu vou ler isso daqui uns dias ou meses ou at msm anos provavelmente no eu percebi que o que me fazia feliz hoje j no faz, as coisas que me fazem sentir vivo j no existem, o meu ponto de escape foi tirado de mim e eu percebi que no consigo ser feliz, mais um dia eu me sinto triste sem saber o por qu, mais um dia que eu choro sem ter por que chorar, eu sinto minha vida se esvaindo aos poucos, me sinto cada dia mais morto e at que isso tudo acabe eu j terei dado um fim, eu definitivamente estou me esgotando psicologicamente e isso t sendo muito rpido eu j no sinto graa them fazer as coisas que fazia antes, no tenho com quem desabafar at tenho mas me falta coragem pra falar percebo que tenho problemas demais, porm todos temos problemas e se eu dividir isso com algum eu posso estar incomodando. por isso eu falo comigo mesmo o que chega ser deprimente, pois minha companhia pssima. se eu tiver lendo isso eu s queria dizer o quo vc forte, por mais que no parea vc t aguentando tudo isso sozinho e calado, o que errado da sua parte mas vc no tem outra opo. me disseram uma vez que chorar lava a alma e talvez elas estejam erradas pq eu tenho chorado demais e me sinto cada vez mais sujo, no de corpo mas de alma, t sendo um peso pra mim e esse peso t me sufocando eu no me sinto amado, no me sinto vivo e muito menos querido....c estou eu, 3 meses desde a ltima vez, talvez eu esteja mais perto do que nunca, faltam 7 dias pra me decidir se vivo ou se morro, agr so 1 03 da manh, no paro de pensar them cortar os meus pulsos e s morrer, eu estou com isso them mente, hj eu descobri que no posso ter o amor da minha vida e percebi que tenho sentimentos demais por ela, mas isso me deixa to mal, talvez deva fazer como van gogh e tomar tinta amarela, vai me dar a iluso que estou feliz e vai me matar aos poucos. as vezes eu penso se ela fez pra me magoar ou foi apenas coincidncia, mas acredito que todo mundo tem um lado e como um cientista disse uma vez ""se algo pode dar errado, vai dar errado"" bom ele no disse assim com essas palavras, mas foi mais ou menos isso . engraado por que eu dessa vez estou me sentindo com medo do que uma pessoa pode fazer, eu simplesmente quero morrer pra no ter que ver ou aceitar o fato que eu no posso ter tudo que eu quero. acho que vou morrer them breve e tudo que eu fiz nesse tempo foi chorar e chorar. uma vez eu li que ""quem decide morrer no o faz por falta de amor vida, mas porque o sofrimento se tornou insuportvel"" e essa frase me faz refletir, pq eu tenho medo do sofrimento que vai vir e como escapatria morrer seria uma forma de no sofrer ele depois. eu no consigo fechar os olhos sem pensar nela conversando com ele, eu nunca senti essa mistura de dio e medo. mas eu no tenho coragem de me matar, mas quero muito morrer. sla escrevi isso uns dias a",2

"i found a way to kill myself, now all i have to do is wait for the occasion i am going to get drunk and jump off a bridge into water. this is the most peaceful way to go i could come up with. i am domestically abused by my mom and there is no way out of this household. the solution might seem obvious, get a job, spare money, find a place to live. but the problem is that my mom will not let me move out because, according to our culture, women should not move out of their parents house until they get a husband. she keeps threatening to kill me, get me tortured etc. even though i am doing my best to appease her. when somebody else makes her mad she lashes out on me and my 3 younger half-sisters, who are basically being raised by me because my mom and step-father do not want to take care of themmoving out secretly is not an option either because in order to do that i would have to have a job, and my mom will not let me get one. i do not even have a bank account despite being on the verge of turning 18. my school noticed that there is something wrong with me because i kept falling asleep in the middle of classes so they made me talk to my school counselor, i told her almosr everything so she contacted some organization that helps troubled young people. they were supposed to help me with moving out but they could not do anything, of course they did not explicitly say that but they told me multiple times that my situation is ""very difficult"", that they are not sure what to do, they even straight up told me that i am trapped. my mom hid my documents away from me, does not let me go out i have to stay home 24 7, look after my 3 half-sisters and do chores , does not care about my education, forces her beliefs on me and physically and psychologically abuses me like i am not obedient like a fucking dog. my mom is not even employed, she never works. she either goes out with her friends or lounges at home and does nothing all day. i have no decent future ahead of me. of course i am not blaming everything on my mom, i brought some of this upon myself too. i cannot wait to fucking die",6

to preface i would like to apologize in advance for any posting informality this is my first reddit post i just graduated university in may of 0 and received a job at a global digital marketing agency agency life a a first job wa too emotionally taxing for my well being and gave me extremely bad performance anxiety i quit this job right before the start of 0 and have been looking for a job since i briefly had a job in february of 0 however a close friend of mine offed himself and i wa fired for taking time off to grieve due to this i started taking prozac and visiting a therapist once a week thing were going fine until i decided to drink on prozac one night and have a psychotic episode this episode caused me to get extremely aggressive towards my roommate for no reason i wa running down a list of accusation some true and some untrue however my girlfriend worried for the safety of my roommate decided to slap me in hope to end the episode terrible idea i know amp we have no history of domestic abuse this lead me into a meltdown where i called the cop trying to get her arrested for assault along with spewing false detail of thing that i wa hallucinating the cop soon realized i wa having an episode and luckily didn t press charge and talked me somewhat down from being aggressive once they left i packed up every item i own and drove hour to my family s house i don t remember anything until i wa almost finished packing my stuff i severely hurt my roommate and girlfriend i don t think about coming back because of how overwhelming the guilt will feel i m not sure what i should do and my brain is focusing on the permanent solution i guess the reason for this post is to ask for any advice or tip i didn t want to drone on regarding other incident so i ll leave a list below of what s happened in the past year cut off abusive parent experienced a few other meltdown due to work school stress lost a ton of friend due to self isolation took too many psychedelics which ha given me bad general anxiety wa arrested and impulsively moved halfway around the u before i wa ready to life for the past year ha gone continuously downhill for me i can t realistically see a way out of this,2

"lately life has not been the best for me , i have been avoiding my family and ignoring their phone calls because i just do not want to talk. i miss family events because i do not want them to see me and ask why i am not okay. everyday i wake up a wave of grief and depression just wash over me and i hate it. everyday of my life is a battle and i am getting closer to my edge. i feel like my life is going no where and that the best thing for me to do is just end it all , i obviously did not succeed in this life therefore there is no point in being around just existing without a purpose. i try to talk to my mom and to my brother but they do not understand, they think its not as serious but they have no idea the turmoil and pain that goes on in my mind. i have so much ptsd from my life. in 2018 my grandpa , cousin and brother all died. my brother was killed by his friend on his own daughters birthday and my cousin was murdered at a red light in los angeles. that is not even the tip of the iceberg. throughout my life i have lost so many friends and family to gun violence and i hate it. i grew up going to funerals and seeing my loved ones die young . i feel like i have the same fate in store for me and i am just waiting for the day to come . i never liked living in this world and feeling all this pain and having no one to talk to . it just sits in my head all day . i know no ones going to see this but i just wanted to get this off my chest. sorry for bothering. just please check up on your family members when you know they are not okay. sometimes a small thing like asking someone if they are okay is the difference between them ending their lives and them not doing it trapped in my head",2

"i can never relax my neck shoulders jaw...any tips? first off, i have ptsd from being in the military. i overreact to stressors in my environment significantly. so i am totally aware of having higher stress levels than the average person. but what i do not understand is why my muscles stay tense 24 7. i mainly feel this in my neck jaw shoulders area. i literally and not saying this like ""omg i literally died the other day when...but as in the way the term is actually meant for feel like i cannot let my head relax into my pillow at night. it's like my body refuses to allow the pillow to take the weight of my head. i can consciously think, ""ok, i'm gonna relax my neck now and let my head fall deep into this pillow,"" and it works...for a few fleeting moments until i stop actively thinking about it. seconds later i will realize that my shoulders are up to my ears again, and my neck is no longer relaxing. i keep my jaw tense all the time as well. so much so that i have so many chipped teeth that my dentist has stopped fixing them until they get really bad. i have a bite guard for sleeping, but i think the damage is also done during the day. i asked my wife the other day which was ""normal"" for her when not thinking about it, do your top and bottom teeth stay closed touching each other, or is there a small gap? she went with the small gap, and i can see that my body wants that to be my normal too, but it is not. my teeth stay chomped down onto each other, nearly 24 7. i'd bet my neck and teeth stay tense even when i am asleep. i absolutely hate this. i can never get comfortable. i cannot sleep well. i look like a 10 year old with adhd because i'm constantly wiggling around while seated in order to get some sort of comfort here and there. and all this misery boils down to the tension in these 3 areas. anyone have any suggestions for this? i've told my dr many times at the va about this, and i have muscle relaxers, but rarely take them because they make me super sleepy during the day, and if i take them at night, i feel kinda hung over the next morning. so i only take them when in absolute discomfort. i go to a chiropractor 2x a week. i go to physical therapy for shoulder issues 2x a week. i regularly use a foam roller and a chirp wheel, almost daily, several times a day. i even started yoga this week...but i've only been once so far. oh, and i get a massage 2x a month, by a massage therapist at the chiropractor, who can target areas of concern from my chiropractic file. so not a feel good massage, but one that works on working knots out and loosening ligaments not sure if i am using the right terminology there . last week, after several months, she was able to finally ""get in"" my upper traps and for a few amazing, godly seconds, i actually felt true neck relaxation. it was so wonderful....and so sad when it quickly went back to my normal. but that fleeting glimpse of bliss told me that it is possible to find relief. so i have finally turned to reddit to ask for help.",5

"my life sucks. and i mean it really sucks. i have been hating my life since i was 8. at no point has it ever looked up until now but that is complicated i am forcing myself to make friends. and i am getting emotionally attached to this girl. my significant other kind of blows me off frequently. i am falling for this girl. i do not think it will ever happen but we are incredibly close. she did start crushing on my friend though. i have spend hours every day talking with her. i genuinely hated being alone. i am glad i have her as a friend. 7-8yo - sexually abused start to identify as trans, but its a little early, so its not as acceptible so i have to hide it in and out of fostercare for a few years. complex mental health issues had already started. 15yo, used by a 25yo. things get really bad. 23yo i continue the cycle that happened to me at 15. get busted. spend a year in prison, 3 years on probation. 29yo now. all i have are my friends, and i am positive they will just abandon me as per usual. still dysphoric as hell. high double digit suicide attempts. 10 or so icu visits. let us just say its complicated. i want to self harm, i have all these feelings i am incapable of dealing with. i fell for a girl i should not have. i do not cheat. but i cannot control my heart or my emotions. i feel a natural chemistry. its possible that my romantic feelings are just misattribution since i am unused to any affection, intimacy, anyone caring etc, you get the point. so, i will just assume the feelings are real. i have the feeling that shits going to blow up soon. why does she have to like my friend. we met her at the same time. this is the first person who i have told most of my story to. she did not pull away. i am lost, self harm could help me find my way. clarity is always higher after the suicide attempt would be nice if i would stop failing. afterwards everything is simpler for months after. i am grey like a walking zombie. i have been ready to die most of my life. i just do not know what to do. what is the point.",6

"i have been struggling with some sort of depressive disorder since i was probably 9 or so and i am 28 now. when i was young i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes which i account for the beginning of all of this. diabetes can be a real pain but is on whole quite manageable with the grin and bare it mentality i have developed. it took me 7 or so years to graduate university with a degree in biology, i second guessed my self so often it was easier to go to bed than accomplish anything worthwhile. relationships are taxing when i cannot numb my mind, i process and realize outcomes quicker than they can become reality. tonight i went to play trivia with friends as is usual. all of them bailed last minute but being the extrovert i am i was able to join a new group and had a bunch of fun with them. a person i would consider a crush was there tonight and after trivia i attempted to communicate with them. they ghosted me which was very unlike our previous interactions. i am stuck thinking about what all of this means in my head and the easy high of participating with a fun trivia group with the low of being ghosted is a lot to take on. i am stuck. putting myself out there.",2

"i have an intense urge desire to commit suicide. i do not understand myself. this is going to sound quite selfish but there are times when i wish death upon my last remaining loved ones, just so i can commit suicide without causing anyone any emotional harm. the intensity of the urge seems to have been rising up day-by-day. i had really thought that i was done with this way of thinking, but it seems that i was incorrect. i know that i should seek medical help but i already am a burden to my family. i would never want them to spend any money on that. and this is not your typical father and mother, sister and brother type of family. it is quite messed up really. but i will not go too deep into it, it is just that my mother and father are divorced, and my mother lives with my grandfather and i live with them too. and my father... well, he does not care at all. he is married for the 3rd time, but the point is he never did care about me. and it is okay. i just have to point this out to clarify why i will not be getting help. but that is not the only reason. there is also the fact that we live in the countryside where there is not psychological help available. so there is that. what kind of advice would you give to someone like me? can i cure myself? are there any techniques that may help at least lower my volume of suicidality? because i know that this is not normal. i have been trying quite a lot of things. reading all sorts of things to make my outlook on life at least a bit positive. and it did work for a while, i had not felt this way in a while, until that is.. the death of my beloved grandmother.. about 19-20 days ago. but it is not because of her.. well partially. i in general do not have a desire to live or do anything with my life, if anything i would end it. but i am alive for these loved ones beside me. i do not want to make them sad or upset them. i could not imagine them in that much pain. but one of them recently has died and surely that made me feel a certain way. almost as if death got one step closer. i have subconsciously made up this plan that when my mother dies, i will be committing suicide. of course, the future is uncertain but that is a plan after all. anyway, i have been typing for a while now.. if anyone has read this far, thank you. hope we get better, stranger. can i cure my mental health if i cannot seek professional help?",2

"i used to read studies about depression, so anything that has come out within the last 4 years i have not seen. from what i recall, the most effective ways for treating major depressive disorder in general included therapy and prescription medication. this is obviously a broad statement.i have taken prescription medications ssris and have dealt with all of the side effects. at the time, i was also in therapy. i have felt numb when the drugs were supposedly working . i have had the ""head in the clouds"" feeling consistently. coming off of each ssri was a nightmare. brain zaps shocks, major suicidal tendencies, detachment, etc. it was brutal.right now, family is encouraging me to get some sort of help. i admit i am at a really really low point in my life. if you saw me, you could not tell. i am in excellent shape, have a decent demeanor and engage positively with everyone. it is extremely hard going back on prescription medication. i have not found anything that has really worked well. wellbutrin kind of sorta helped. i have been in therapy weekly in the past. has it helped? kind've? so the alternative is being how i am at this moment. 46m, no job, no relationship, living at the base of a beautiful mountain but severely depressed and suicidal. i never plan on having kids because of said problems.my opinion on society has degraded quite significantly over the years. i have lost any sort of joy, contentment, happiness, for anything in life.i feel like i am just throwing myself into an unsolvable puzzle. i am at a loss, really. unsolvable puzzle",2

"hi all,i have had depression since i was a kid. i have a long family history of bipolar, borderline. it was talked about and my parents have mental health issues, but the only thing i was ever treated for is adhd.in the past, i used to have pretty bad gad generalized anxiety disorder , and had a lot of panic attacks. i would also have some really severe points of depression where i was pretty debilitated for 1-2 weeks, but i have found for the most part my more severe points of anxiety depression have diminished.i do have some substance issues, mainly drinking which is not a daily thing but once i start i cannot stop, just heavy binge drinking. i did used to use quite a bit of c ke which was a big personal and financial issue, but i have curbed that for the most part. a few of my friends actually had an intervention with me about my drinking, when i get past the point of no return with alcohol i get extremely depressive and just talk about dark stuff in my past and just want to take any and all drugs. my friends were basically like every time you drink you do this and its too much for us etc, we cannot deal w this and you need to stop. so severer depression recently has manifested itself more in substances than in my day to day.however, my day to day is meaningless and empty. i do well at work because its the one thing i am a perfectionist about, but the way i live is so depressing. i have nothing to look forward to, i wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. sometimes have friends over for drinks.i cannot take care of myself, i can barely maintain personal hygiene like showering or doing laundry, i have garbage all over my apartment. i have no energy or motivation to do anything. something traumatic happened to me about 5 years ago, since then i have gained 100 pounds just with binge eating.i cannot even look at myself in the mirror, let people take photos of me. before i had insecurities, but i still wanted to be seen. my friends do not even invite me out for day activities because on my days off i am in bed till like 5pm.i am an artist, that is the only thing i care about. i have not been able to make work in almost 2 years because the burden of it feels like too much. i feel like a fraud, like i do not even know where to start.i am not majorly depressed right now, i have been there where all i want is to die, but its more just like day in and day out meaninglessness. i dissociate a lot, always going through the motions and i feel like i am wasting my life.i am really uncomfortable with doctors, i have not been to one since 2012 lol because of a bad experience. overall though i can barely take care of myself so scheduling appointments is something i have been delaying for years.but for those in a similar situationon antidepressants, ssris etc -has this helped you deal with the day to day? i know i should make a lifestyle change and put more effort into being happier, but it just feels so daunting. i am wondering if beginning with a prescription will get me to the point where i can begin to address the areas of my life i need to work on. pls share your medication experience how it impacted you! i feel like its the only way for me to get somewhere because i feel like i have been completely stagnant. will antidepressants help me, or do i need to make a lifestyle change?",2

"bipolar with social anxiety hello! i am new here and i figured i would find a chat board that i can relate to. i've been diagnosed bipolar for over 12 years as well as adhd, ptsd, trichotillomania and social anxiety. my fiance and i just recently moved and what two friends i had turned out to only want me around because i finally got my disability and had income finally. given that, i'm back to having no friends again in my community. it's painfully hard for me to talk to new people as people see me as socially awkward and just not someone to fit in anywhere. with that said i was just hoping to make a friend or friends who know what my struggle is daily with these conditions. my fiance and my dad are my friends right now, but i would like some females to hang out with and talk to. my fiance and i are getting married this year in october so i am under a lot of stress and my anxiety is really high. i don't bite much, tend to have a good sense of humor but i'm way to good at seeing through people. if someone's fake i know it pretty quickly which also keeps me isolated. i just want a friend.",1
"so recently i realised that i have just been emotionally numb. it is gotten to the point where i cannot even cry and i feel like my friends have started to notice too. for example, when i finished college it was an emotional time and everyone was crying but i just felt nothing. even though they were some of my closest friends that i would hardly see again.the worst part is i have taken to self harming once again, something i thought i had finally gotten over. before when i self harmed i would feel guilty and ashamed at what i had done but now it is just nothing. even when it was worse, i still feel nothing at all. it is like i am an empty she will of what i used to be. i am just numb",2

i wasn t in a relationship but there wa this girl who i wa heavily attracted to for whatever reason nothing worked out well i ve tried throwing the kitchen sink at it for quite some time now but i ll never get any closure because she s hardly active on any social medium after much deliberation i actually realized that i still do have the same feeling for her now a i did back then but i can t do shit about it i ve started to accept that my pain probably won t ever go away unless my life doe and i ve been having an intention to act on that,2
"ever since i left school, i ve felt much more in control of my fears and my emotions, i ve had a happier outlook on life and i ve been happier overall. but now, it just seems like every time i m sick, if i m nauseous or dizzy, it has to be my anxiety. and if i don t try to plough through that kind of problem, i m letting anxiety ruin me, according to my family. i know they don t get how real it feels when you re sick from anxiety but i know the difference in myself. i know the difference between anxiety-sick and having an illness caused by something else.",3
"just need to vent this out i guess, but was also wondering if anyone here can relate.a few years ago i was suicidal, and nearly followed through, but i convinced myself not to. i was in school at the time and hated it, so i wanted to see what life had to offer afterwards. now i wish id done it. i am in this weird place where i think about death and dying every day, but i lack the willpower to actually do it. i think about my brother, and what i could be missing out on, i wonder if there is something waiting out there for me that i do not want to miss.i wish i did not care. i wish i saw no brightness in my future, and i wish i was numb enough to end my life. but i am not, and so, i am stuck. i wish i was actively suicidal",2
"it s not that i don t want to live, it s that i don t want to live like this. this is where i am tonight. sick of all the meds, their side effects, the doctors, therapist, support group, of it all. the sad part of it is that yes it will end but only when i die.",1

"sorry bad english since almost 2 weeks now i've cut myself off every social interaction because i've been confronted to doubting and all that shit and i thought that was a necessary measure to take to reborn trough introspection, my whole life since now is involved and stop burst out of rage and being depressed from nothing and now i keep myself at the strict minimum of social interaction, 10 days that my daily conversation is limited at some words my mental health is decreasing i'm starting to struggle breath by the mouth, now i breath and speak with the nose probably because i don't open it enough",5
"where to stay during summer holidays? 1-2 months europe i'm looking for some ideas or thoughts, every holiday since childhood i'm 26 now i spent in my hometown living with my parents who used to be pretty abusive. despite them now trying to do better i still think it's not healthy for me to be there for 3 months straight but idk what to do. i got no friends or relationship duh and i only finished highschool. i don't mind strangers seeing me too much, i mainly struggle with seeing someone regularly. i got few thousands saved since i never used to spend money on anything. i'm not thinking about travelling, rather renting something in nature and staying in one place for a month or two. i was thinking maybe look for an animal shelter job in my country but i doubt they'll hire me for a month, on the other hand i'm afraid i'll be completely bored. do yall have any thoughts about that or have you done sth similar?",4
"its strange, it seems like i am always either hyper aware of my existence or i feel like i do not exist at all and i am simple observing everyone else. i have felt this way for a long time, but the whole feeling like i do not exist thing is starting to impact me more and more. i cannot motivate myself to do anything when it does not even feel like i am real. the feeling is so genuine that i cannot even say that i know it sounds crazy. that being said, i still cannot bring myself to tell anyone in my life that i feel this way. as much as it make sense to me, no one around me will get it. it would just freak them out. does anyone else feel this way? what would be a good way to potentially bring this up to someone? i do not have a clue how i would even start that convo. i feel like i do not exist",2
"until i met my new boyfriend, he is amazing, he is kind, he is sweet, he is a good student, he likes the same things as me, my family likes him, and so on... but i dont feel that passion that rush i felt with my ex, the truth is that when i started going out with my boyfriend i secretly saw my ex a few times to see if i really didnt feel nothing for him, but it was disgusting, i didnt even want him to touch me, i feel bad with myself i didnt want him, but still, i was there. then i kinda realized i felt nothing love related for him and it was ok, he was hurt when he knew i was dating this boy and he even begged me to stay but of course not. but now the problem is that when im with my boyfriend i dont feel like i love him, like that thing you kinda have to feel with a new love, i just feel ""ok"" with him, and i catch myself thinking about my ex from time to time, remembering all the good things we had and it drives me crazy because i know that if i see him again i wont feel that way, that ""love"" that my mind makes me think stills there. and recently i found out that he has a girl and he is actually enjoying the experience and i got so mad and so hurt i know i dont have any right to feel that way i felt betrayed and i still feel that way, i gross myself out.",5
"bothered by unhelpful thoughts? it can happen so easily. you re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. or, maybe you re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive. your mind is incredible. when you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! you could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life. these strategies can help manage thoughts that don t support you maintain space between yourself and your thoughts. you don t have to engage with your thoughts. you don t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you re driving down the road. most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further. you can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. allow them to simply pass on by. your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts. recognise that it is your brain s nature to produce random thoughts. the thoughts you experience say little about you. it s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. it s always going to give you something to think about. occasionally those thoughts are useful. frequently, they re frivolous. sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. we have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on. meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind. the first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind. focus on your breathing. when you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing. focus your attention on a thought of your choosing. you can think about anything you choose to think about. you can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today. when you re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit. apply logic. poor thinking leads to poor decision making. when your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. what would you advise a friend to do? are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? you re not alone. the human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it. the key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.",5

"would my may2018 ecg of picked this up? worried! so yesterday i was drilling some wood and i out of nowhere felt a dul pain in my left arm and chest, i think it was brought on by putting arm in or moving it in specific positions, and when i took a breath, my left side of chest hurt! it went on like for a few seconds and the simptoms subsided but sometimes if i take a deep breath or lay in some positions it hurts the arm or chest but if i am just sitting still on my computer it doesn't hurt i read about silent hart attacks and this caused me to have my anxiety spiral out of controle again! if there was anything wrong in my heart, would it of showed up on my ecg or is it possible that this could be something new? i keep worrying but i haven't let this whole thing keep me from enjoying my day. i had my ecg in may of 2018 when my anxiety had spiraled out of controle over some palpitations that were 99.9 attributed to eating too many of those chocolate easter eggs. what i notice from the new simptoms though, is that the pains are very intermittent and come and go, like sometimes i will feel some chest pain if i take a deep breath, sometimes if i raze my arm, or hold it a certen way, etc i was able to get a good night's sleep but still worrying about the whole possibility of some undetected heart thing or a potentially dangerous problem. i am 25yo male, 145lbs",0

"the note i wrote if i die today i wish to apologise for who i have become, a person who revels in avoiding any feelings and seeks to bother when he knows no close connection will form, to avoid pain. i procrastinate on all aspects of my life though i make it appear as though i am hard working and i want to be friends with people when overall i just want to fade into nothingness.i do not know what made me like this whether it be how i always have been or through events transpired, though i choose to believe this is only through my conscious thoughts that i may have carried out actions that have hurt others and not due to external factors.to my family i do love you and hope you live on remembering how strong and beautiful you are, and how you all were there for me and forgiving me for my misdeeds time and time again. to people who considered me a friend i have surely hurt you many times emotionally, all i can ask is that you move on and find a better person than i to be friends with, as your all good people even if you do not think you are.and finally to whatever awaits me following my death whether it be gods, god and the devil, nothingness or purgatory, just know that i am glad i got to gaze up at the stars because there is all of creation for those i part ways with to still explore.sincerely me today i found my old suicide note i made in 2019 even though life can still be pretty shitty i am still so thankful to the people who stopped me. if you need support please do reach out.",6
for context my so and i are living with our in law temporarily a famously difficult living arrangement and the main issue ha been their constant and relentless remark they love passive aggressively hinting at thing they dislike and throwing little dig here and there to get a rise out of u i m well aware that they are very much projecting their own insecurity unhappiness onto u and i m somewhat able to find solace in that yet it still get tiring after awhile i m extremely sensitive and hyper aware of myself and others and even little throw away comment can feel like a punch in the gut sometimes we plan to move out soon but for the time being how can i distance myself emotionally and take thing at face value,2

"so i have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a while now, and even attempted to in april. unfortunately i was never seen. my friends were worried about me and offered to help. unfortunately i have been too burdensome the past few months, and eventually i had a really bad mental break. and now one of them is not talking to me. i lashed out in a bad moment . luckily i did get seen this time in the er, and had a stay in the psych ward. i got to talk about things and i found some meds that help me stay calm. staying calm was not something i was capable of before, even if i was really good at hiding it. i am really struggling with how i hurt my friends. i feel like shit. i did not realise how well i was doing before the mental break. i want my friend back, and i want to apologise. i can barely focus on anything else right now. i hate myself a lot right now. i messed up",2
"after 1 year with no job, i finally got one only to quit this morning after working half a shift. i m so embarrassed. after over a year of hospital stays, manic episodes and what not, i finally felt well enough to apply for a job at a salon i have been going to and i was hired the same day! i was so proud and excited! i told my friends and family and my sister even took me out for drinks to celebrate. then came monday and it was just a training day. my anxiety got the best of me and didn t sleep at all sunday night but i think i did well on monday except for a few times i think i talked way more than i should have and possibly said some stupid shit. so then i was scheduled to work again today. i haven t slept this entire time, i m manic and have had 3 panic attacks. i m obviously not ready yet and i feel like such an asshole for even trying. i sent a stupid long text to the girl that hired me apologizing but basically saying i can t do it. so i sit here typing this and crying my eyeballs out because i failed again and feel like i really am letting people down. again. setting up a therapy appointment as soon as they open this morning... edit i don t think you guys will ever know how much your words of encouragement mean to me. i m crying again but this time from thankfulness. ??",1

"it's unfortunate we can't crosspost links from other subs like r psychology to r ptsd because sometimes a useful article comes along that might really help. tl dr - this study suggests, for whatever reason, some people who experience trauma learn to associate signifiers of the event with less invasive memories which helps them be less affected by it. and that it could potentially be applied in cbt therapy. it doesn't say how as of yet. disclaimer i have not read the url itself, just the article.",3

"i was doing very well for some time now. probably since early spring. no clue what set me off. i have not been enjoying my new job much, but that is not a new feeling took the job in january . i woke up tired today. as the day went on, my ability to focus on work and maintain my motivation to get through the work day quickly deteriorated. by dinner, i had no plans of eating managed a protein bar at lunch . this is not usual - normally i am hungry and, when depressed, i binge eat often. but my boyfriend decided to cook the meal i was meant to make us, so i did eat a healthy dinner. i then laid down in my made bed. i did not get up again. i have things to do around the house, but i cannot be bothered. they do not matter to me in the moment, but, at the same time, they do. i have anxiety about wasting time just laying here. but i cannot find a good reason to actually get up. about an hour ago, i started crying. i feel heavy and like there is low-grade electricity in my skin. i am uncomfortable. i have no idea why i feel sad.but i do know that my boyfriend otherwise ignoring me all night after dinner did not help. sure, he made the food though he also had to eat , but then he never checked on me. he got mad that i asked him for what was probably the millionth time in the last 6 years not to touch my stomach when he came in to say goodnight just before he went to bed. i do not like my stomach touched and i have been explicitly clear about this to him relentlessly he just does not care about my boundaries. because i called him out via asking him once again not to do the thing he was doing, he curtly said goodnight and left without giving me a kiss as he usually would have done. that was my punishment, i guess. he very often withholds various forms of affection and this is usual behavior for him. so, i am not surprised. and i was not surprised he never checked on me because he is also very selfish and self-centered likely a narcissist . but i am not here to talk about him and his many problems or how these impact me. while his behavior and the way he treats me has done absolutely nothing to improve my overall mental health, i was depressed long before him and i am sure i will be long after. i was not expecting him to help today or do anything really, but brought it up because i wanted to mention still that i am nevertheless feeling disappointed that the person i care about did not give me the care that i have in the past and would have given him if our positions were reversed today. i knew he would not, but it still sucks that he did not. either way, i was already sad and do not know why. this just did not help the situation.background depression has been a problem for most of life over the last 20 years on and off. in min my mid-30s now. its better and then its not. i can go long stretches of almost months and be completely fine feeling cured.and then something will set me off again into a downward spiral. usually quite slowly, so i do not see it coming. but i am getting better at identifying when the symptoms are starting to onset and i can start to employ my various countermeasures. but sometimes, often really, it is tough to identify what triggers it to come back. when my depression is bad, i am insatiably hungry, tired, unfocused, unmotivated, sad crying on and off , experience loss of interest in friends hobbies fun, have loss of sex drive, and i cannot sleep. this is sometimes accompanied by anxiety attacks and a one-time panic attack. anxiety is new to the party in the last 2-3 years. and its not nearly as much of an issue, but its there at times. sometimes with the depression and sometimes on its own. fortunately, i am able to force myself to work so that it has never really impacted my career. but i cannot do much else when in a depressive episode. which can last for days to months though its been awhile since its been more than a few weeks . i live with my boyfriend, whom i love despite his narcissism he is not all bad, i swear. he just has a lot of his own problems and has no problem putting himself first and or being selfish . hes almost 40 and we have lived together almost 6 years and it is manageable for now as i cannot afford any other option anyway. he might not be helping my depression but he is not purposely making it worse. and that is a lot better than the last several guys. my us employer-supplied health insurance does not cover therapy and i cannot afford therapy out-of-pocket i have researched this extensively . lethargic, low-grade anxiety, sad for no reason.",2

"intense bursts of anxiety and stress i did a little bit of research prior to this but i couldn't find anything specific enough to my situation. does anyone here get these intense bursts of like anxiety, agitation and stress seemingly from out of nowhere? i always need to step away when i feel this way just to clear my head, and it's over the most trivial things - often a sudden change of plans or having to multitask e.g. being part of a conversation while getting texts i need to reply to . it completely overwhelms me to the point where i can't think straight. i get really snappy and rude, and i feel terrible about it cause i can't control it and it affects the people around me. it's a very confusing feeling but it fades again after maybe 10-20 minutes of clearing my head. that's also around the time where embarrassment kicks in and i start apologising for being so cold and rude. can anyone relate? how do you handle it and maybe prevent it from overwhelming you?",1

"of course, i pretend to feel happy around most people. but even when i am with someone who knows i am depressed, i have to pretend? like, if i am eating with my friends and look happy, then they will probably think i just say i am depressed for attention because i seem happy, but if i actually look depressed, then they will think it is attention seeking for them to ask me if i am okay or something like that. so i try to look like i am trying to look happy but failing cuz then they will know i am depressed but trying to look happy, if that makes sense. i have to pretend even with my psychologist, because if i look happy, then they will not take me seriously, but if i look always depressed, they will think i do not listen to them. same with my sister, she tries to help me, but if i look too happy, she will think i was just pretending to have depression, but if i look depressed, then i am not even trying to feel better. it happens all the time and i do not even know if i am honest with myself. i always feel like i am pretending something",2
"pretty basic post. i just wanted to vent and know if there was anything i could possibly do to talk myself off the edge this time.i am 16, just turned this past may, yeah i know my post history says i have been 16 for longer but whatever, i am tired of keeping up with all my online ages. i am currently away from my house, staying with my aunt and uncle in north carolina. i thought this trip would make me feel better, but it has not, and it is made it substantially worse. there is guns everywhere. i am constantly misgendered i know it is annoying to hear that word, believe me i hate it too, but it is been taking a pretty big toll. i feel horrifically guilty for existing around these people and making them uncomfortable by looking and acting masculine. they expected a girl, not some hairy weirdo that looks like it is going to break down and cry everytime you call it a girl. i just want to hide and act like i do not exist, i want to go to a place where no one has to indulge my make-pretend fantasy but me. i want the constant buzz of thought in my mind to go away. i want my mom to get the attention she wants from my death and finally stop villianizing me.i try to visualize my future and all i see is pity and rejection, constant pain from my past, and more than likely a few addictions to boot. i see no woman or man truly loving me, maybe a pity date once and a while. i know that i will never have enough money to get surgery or go on t, i know that i will most likely age out of highschool and barely be able to land a job that i will miserably work at for twenty years.i just want to take myself out before i have the displeasure of experiencing what my adult life will be like. i have no friends, i have distanced myself from all of them. i have no siblings. most of my outer family is dead. i do not talk to my mom's side. my dad will most likely die before he hits 45. my mom will not care, it is not like i was making honor roll anyway and now she has another excuse to bitch and whine.i am done. i am barely 16 and i am done. i am so tired of suffering. being trans is horrible and i am ready to add to the statistics.",6

"i am 40 years old. all my life i have had the ones i love taken from me and it just keeps happening.i shut myself down for years after losing my daughters all because i refused to take my ex back after she cheated on me with some guy from her work while i was raising our kids.i recently met an amazing woman, a truly kind and gentle soul. against my better judgement i let them in. i struggled to trust anyone after what my ex did, i had to, well i felt like i had to keep everyone at arms length to protect myself. but i trusted this one, i let my guard down.now someone who is in her life that has tormented and betrayed her and left her isolated - has demanded she isolate herself. she did so without question.i have had people suddenly disappear on me before and not cared. after losing my daughters, anything less than something that bad has not hurt at all. why is this time hurting so much.its my fault. all of this is. i must be an absolute monster to keep deserving this pain and isolation. i am so very sick of being broken and alone.i am so very sick of... all of this. i am so sick and tired of having the people i care about being taken from me.",6
"29yo male. feeling numb and hopeless. my life is not the greatest right now drifted from friends, single, childless, isolated and alienated, not many prospects - i can only see the darkness in life atm. might be a trope but the only reason i have not done it yet is that i am very close to my elderly parents, especially my mother who doted on me being 'mum' is a large part of her identity and it would destroy them. felt down in the past but never like this. strong antihistamines mixed with a strong megadose opioid is looking more like rest everyday. not really looking for advice, just felt like talking into the void feeling suicidal for the first time in my life",6
"hi, i am looking for some words of advice and comfort here.a month ago, during an argument, my boyfriend 24m revealed to me 22f that he is suicidal. he was furious to have said it and became upset with me for having brought the truth out from him. i was never under the impression that i acted inappropriately at the time, but over time i realized i disrespected a boundary i had no idea existed. i made a mistake i have so much trouble understanding. and a part of me was relieved that he told me-- i also learned he has been seeing a therapist for a year, but after the argument he told me he was no longer interested in therapy. since this happened, my boyfriend and i have not seen each other. we have known each other for three years and have dated long distance through the pandemic. we initially continued seeing each other long distance, zoom and facetime to play videogames and talk about our days as if nothing was wrong, but my emotions kept ""getting in the way."" but from the beginning of this crisis, he said he could no longer trust me or the relationship because he cannot bear to think about the problem and my fear and sadness are extremely upsetting because they cast doubts on his recovery. i understand where he is coming from and objectively, the nature of an intimate relationship goes against his desire for distraction and levity -- i have accepted this. we have started a two-week no contact break this week. before then, i did everything i could to communicate my understanding and faith in him and his recovery, even though i cried due to my anxiety about the situation. but he has been so strong and sought out help before-- i must believe he has the courage to overcome this. as i am someone who struggled with depression and some suicidal ideation too, it breaks my heart to know my boyfriend is suffering like this -- and that i only found out now. i know i brought joy into his life, but without ever knowing truly how dark his mind could be, i am distraught that he must have felt disconnected and alone.i deeply understand i am not the solution to his problem. i am working through the paralyzing fear of being unable to do anything for him. again, he only wants distraction now. we are currently on a break to sort out whether he wants to continue in the relationship. we continue to affirm our love and care for one another. as you might understand, the flux of our relationship interacts very poorly with the intense sadness and anxiety about his personal suffering. i do not know whether i should stay or go, regardless of his decision. i am determined to accept what he wants but i am scared if what is to come is a lifetime of not knowing if he is okay. it is an impossible problem and i am just waiting for a sign. i love him so much and can only pray for him to recognize his strength -- to find whatever he needs. my anxiety gets in the way of my seeing signs of hope and reassurance -- he tells me he is keeping himself stable my continuing to see friends and do activities--i trust that is exactly what he needs, it might be just fine to put off the deeper work it might take to overcome his sadness. really, i might just be terrifying myself for no reason. my therapist and family tell me it will all be okay because he told me about his suicidality. and he did so in some detail. even though he was angry, i could not help but feel he might be relieved to share his dark thoughts. and i cannot breathe a word of this to his family or friends, because they would make it worse by wanting to talk about this problem with him, when he absolutely does not want to. this also is a bit scary for me, but i can understand why it has to be this way.i know there is not much i can do but manage my own anxiety. i am learning and adapting, and finding strength. i hope he does exactly what he needs and that the outcome of his decision can preserve his happiness. i found out my boyfriend is suicidal and i am terrified",6

"i am suffering from depression and have been taking professional help as well. i have a few really bad days where i feel like though i want to get my work done, i am unable to as i have no motivation and i just want to lie down or sleep. this makes me question myself, is it really depression who is making my task impossible or am i using depression just as an excuse to avoid work. i am confused, anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since i am on meds, i am able to have a little control over my emotions.i think i had depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. i have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. which reinforces my doubt that maybe i am faking depression as i can use it as an excuse as i am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe i like to stay in depression so i do not have to do any work. but at the same time i never tell anyone at work that i am depressed so maybe i am not faking after all. everything is so confusing. whatever this is, i do not think ill ever be able to get out of this phase. i do not want to stay depressed but i cannot get myself out of it",2
"i have typically always been one who can dish and take jokes and things with my friends. recently, i have felt as if i am taking things in a personal manner. not the context of the joke or comment but the repetition. it has allowed me to almost feel guilt for things that are not true or legitimate. i do not know how to tell my friends that its negatively affecting my mental health, because i do not want to seem like a victim and have them assume i am too sensitive to jokes or comments that are not necessarily harsh, but at the same time, its exhausting me mentally and physically in ways that i cannot explain. i hope this post makes sense to someone. has anybody experienced anything similar, if so, how have things went since in your relationships? not sure how to face the feelings i am dealing",2

"my gf 21f asked me 24m for a temporary break, because she is suffering with depression. and i just do not know what to think. i love her very much, and i believe she does as well. amp context we dated for a year and half, i am her first bf, everything was great but a month or so she changed. a week ago she told me that she was sad all the time and that she was having a hard time dealing with everything, that she feels like a robot without feelings, no spark in her life, nothing. yesterday she asked me for a break so she can figure stuff out, but did not want to ""break the relationship"" per se. below this paragraph i copy pasted editing names our last conversation, that took place a couple of minutes ago. in case that some sentences do not make sense, i translated using an app me i want you to know that i am still your friend, that i am and will be there for whatever you need, a shoulder to cry on, someone to talk to or just to listen, to pick you up in the middle of the night if you want to go out for a drive to clear your mind in silence, or whatever. it does not matter the time or the day, seriously. you are a very intelligent person, strong and with character, i am sure that the situation you are going through is temporary and everything will be fine. you are an incredible person, and i thank god for the blessing that is knowing you. forgive me if this message hurts you in any way, but i want you to know. i love you. amp gf thank you, it makes me feel good to know that you do not hate me. i am worse today than ever, i try to understand myself, but it is too hard. i still think that this time is going to do me good because i am going to be analyzing myself. i have a very special and complicated interior, it is very well hidden and controlled, but i just cannot take it anymore. i need to analyze myself and think well about everything. it breaks my heart just thinking that you hate me or that you are suffering because of me, i feel exaggeratedly bad, but i know that i cannot do anything with what is happening to me, it is not my fault, it is not anyone's fault . i am always there for you too. you are the most incredible person that ever passed through my life, i need you to understand that everything is ok with you, you are perfect. and i want you to know that all the decisions i make are to not hurt you and therefore try not to feel so bad about myself. i never imagined that i was going to be like this, that we were going to be like this, because of me. sorry for all this, i need my time. my feelings are the same. amp i do not know what to do or think, of course i am going to give her the space she wants, but i just feel so guilty amd do not even know why. i do not think i have dealt with this in my life, so i cannot undertand it. i need help, to help her. depressed gf pushing me away, it hurts. how can i help her without pressuring her?",2

"close to midnight rant. i have been strugling with intense feelings and thoughts of despair, hopelesness, hatred, bla bla bla... the good stuff. but i have also had a lot of time to reflect on life, on personal desires, on the state of the world and the kind of people that we ""should"" be.i think we can all agree that current societal norms and stereotypes put a lot of stress on everybody, and they expect to make us less empathetic, be it to friends, peers, the working class, your competition. you have to be a shark, the lone wolf, a champion. empathy is, i am going to, the key to knowledge about all human-related stuff. if we loose empathy, we loose our connection to humanity.i read your posts ""nobody listens to me"", ""i do not know who to talk to"", ""fuck this"". its inmensely relatable and they bear a pattern a lot of people seek answers in others. advice, love, a bit of empathy. while these are essential elements in the daily lives of humans, i believe they cannot solve, maybe not even individually begin the process of healing we need. in my experience, advice from my family is quite nice to have, but it becomes meaningless in a matter of hours. love? it feels fake, not earned, like a convenient lie to ignore the abyss. if stuff like this works for you, that is fantastic! make it worth your while! but perhaps it is not your case it just wears out, it does not make you feel better. we need something more personal.there is something in each and every human that is fundamentally unique, confused and disturbed. and like moths we desperately seek some light to find out what is so complicated to understand and appreciate about ourselves. i have felt an inmense fear of never feeling truly comprehended, of not seeing myself completely in another persons eyes, of being more than myself. but such uniqueness cannot be decoded by others. that may be the only place where empathy will never exist, and that is... well, fine. we will never find the answer to what we must do or want solely trough foreign experiences and advice, we must partially rely on what makes us us, memories and fantasies, past and future. experience. to comprehend and coexist with life, we have to participate in it.of course, a lot of us hate the mere idea of self improvement or ""soul searching"". after all, we tell ourselves all the time that we are not worth such hassle. and perhaps its also not worth doing it for others. but from where do we take this idea of needing worth or some kind of permission to just think? should that matter? why not just say ""fuck it"" in the sense of not caring about what we think of ourselves, because almost nobody really cares? and the few that do already have our backs, either we like it or not!i am not telling you that you should just stop caring about everything, or stop being a coward about introspection, or go cry a river to someone expecting to find ""the answer"". after all, i started this talking about empathy. hell you can counter-rant me all you want, if it just makes you feel a bit more relaxed. i do not know, i had a weird day and tomorrow i must hand over a lot of work. just breathe, almost nobody cares, the few that do care will help you if they can, and in the end you just do not know what could happen. what if. i like uncertainty altough i have terrible luck at uno haha . good night, get some rest. we are alone, and that is ok. rant for the lost ones.",6

"my ""friend"" rang me whilst i was overdosing but i only found out after, but he did not even come to my house to check he instead went and got stoned at another's house and the next day told me i was talking nonsense on the phone.what is the point in living when your closest friend does not even care if you live or die, but when i said this to a different friend he came round banging pushing open my door to tell me that i was lying and i should not be saying that he told me to kill myself whenever i did not even say that. the messages are on facebook messenger of him talking to me for 35 seconds which i have no memory of and then nothing, he did not come round till the day after for 10 seconds to talk about how he got kicked out of his house .what is the point in life if ppl you are suppose to be friends with will not help and then intimate you when you finally tell someone else. that friend group now no longer speaks to me entirely... what is the point 2 october 2018",6
"this year has been many things, each month having its moments. with this month, being the moment of change. i have lost job after job, i wasted my money on my addiction from bottle to bottle. i lost my relationship i said i cherished so much. i misused my finances and the help offered. i let everything go including my health. i decided i wanted better and to be who i have needed to be all this time. i have a job now, i found god and go to church, i take care of my health and go out of my ways to find chances to mature more and more every day. i am making this because i am broke. my cars registration is past due, and the title is not in my name and cannot be because the old owner title hopped and i cannot reach him nor the previous previous owner. i got a warning today for that and i no longer can drive to work. it will surely cost a little something. i could not even pay rent this month or my part in electricity. i have a phone bill too coming up, along with car insurance, and even if i had my car handled i cannot even afford the gas to get to work and back. i am at the end of my wits right now. not even three weeks ago i could easily talk to my gf and id feel better, but she is not here anymore. and we spoke the other day and she seemed like she cares and believes i changed. she just said she needs a little more time to see things the same again. honestly i want to continue to do better everyday, but the hole i put myself in seems more like an unclimbable dried up well. i made a go fund me but i do not expect that to work. if you look at my post history you can see the desperation for it to work though. i am so stressed and hurt and i feel like my hairs tearing out on its own. i just want to start over at the beginning of 2021, and do it right. where i can have my old nice job back, my girl, my dignity and happiness and not this nuclear amount of stress. that is all. i really feel there is nothing i can do anymore, and i am just a basket case of issues.",2
i did something kind of fucked up the week after i turned 13 and its genuinely haunted me ever since. i am a compulsive liar and i genuinely think i deserve to die. i cannot throw away the guilt. i know no one will tell me i deserve to die but i feel deep down i do. this is not the product of mental health issues or intense emotion. i deserve it. i think i am a bad person,6
"first time poster, never used to be like this! hi all, about two years ago i passed out in my bedroom after riding home from work by bike on a cold day. immediately jumped into a hot shower. felt dizzy, confused, and then boom, hit the ground. was kind of half aware half unaware, but then had a killer headache after a bit and slept it off. went to the er the next day for a ct scan. everything was peachy. went about my regular day for a good 4 months until i was playing league and all of a sudden the cursor disappeared whenever it went past my right eye. i could still see out of it, but i couldn't follow the cursor. then the text became hard to read. then i tried texting my mom that i was having a stroke but it came out like gibbrish. then slow creeping numbness up my left arm all the way to my face. somehow managed to call 911 and they brought me in by ambulance. diagnosed migraines. mri was clean. all that happened two years ago. i regularly get these stroke-level migraines with aphasia and confusion about once a month. every sinus infection is a brain infection, every unsymmetrical feature on my skull is a swollen lymph node and lymphoma. i'm itchy all the time in my apartment, so i've got liver failure. every minor ache or pain is the worst possible disease. i can't help myself making doctor appointments because i don't believe i have migraines. my life has been ruined, my personality completely changed. i don't even feel real, i walk around with de-realization daily. who am i? wtf is going on and how do i begin to deal? i'm only 29 and by most accounts pretty healthy.",0

"i am someone living in turkey. my age is probably lower than yours . i am here posting this, so may be someone can help me decide to do something. forgive my grammar mistakes.something happened today and let me begin explain stuff. i am not good at explaining things, forgive me.i was that toxic, ugly, awkward kid you most hate in middle school. i could not talk with people before that time then i got the courage to be myself for some reason when i was 13, then i became the most toxic person you would see. problem is, my actions are stupid. i really do not know what i am doing. i act like a 2 year old child. my selfish feelings was at its peak, i always acted like my body is not there, sure they can hear me but they could not see my weird actions. people see me as a weirdo, they hate me and i did not care like that is their fault. then when i reached 15, something happened. like i realized everything. my stupid talk, actions, trying to be funny stuff etc. i never had a best friend until that age. i met someone. she liked me and i loved her. i was still acting stupid and weird. but i was going down. then that day when my parents made me lock myself in some room, hurt myself and cry like a baby. again. my dad was kicking the door and yelling me open the door. it was happening since i was a child. it was because i did not wanted to go out. i was so anxious that someone see me and recognize from school. i was going outside with a jacket even in summer. then my mother picked the lock and they saw me trying to peel my face off with my nails lol. days later we went a psychiatrist and he told my parents that i was afraid of people seeing my richard in my pants. we took another psychiatrist. paid so well and went outside of the city for that. diagnosed me with depression and social anxiety. i was on some medicine from that time. he asked me if sometimes i wish to be dead. i said sometimes. he wanted some tests, brain scan, blood etc. i could not give blood because i am scared of needles. and it is not like ""oh that is going to hurt"", its more like ""i can cut my arm open with a chainsaw if you want, just do not put that needle on my skin"". i grew with needles as a child. he said all the tests are ok and told me my parents that i am psychotic or something. a month later my depression was pretty much gone. but in that month, i tried to suicide 2 times. and it all went wrong. these were my first times i hurt my first ""best friend"". i had no friends but her. then i apologized so much for thinking about suicide etc. that is the moment where walter became heisenberg. i was so toxic smallest problem would grow up like a huge rock and i was thinking about suicide and crying. i gave up meds, every week i was taking handful of ssris trying to die in sleep. it did nothing except destroying my stomach and sleep. i was talking so negative but selfish with her. she were trying to support me and she were crying with me sometimes. and i started to use it to feed my ego. everytime i got sad, i cried like a baby and she hug me in whatsapp. i became so toxic, everytime she say how are you, i was saying i want to die. it took months but she finally had enough. she were saying ok go ahead and do what you want. i always felt as i love her so much but she is seeing me just like anyone else. even she says opposite. i was afraid of asking that if she care about me sometimes and from that days i went into full time job asking her if she still care about me 12 hours. of course she started to ignore me. and i was aware of it. it went even worse, i was being hostile if she says yes instead ""yess"". hours later i find myself apologizing to the rest of the day. this took months. my family finally knew i had a friend. they of course, do not like me having friends like they did when i was a kid. they were like ok but anytime they see me talk with her, they were saying that ""friendships end after sometime, its nothing important in your life, go study"". oh also i never gave a sht about school since 8th grade. i was afraid of being seen, closed my instagram, snapchat yeah ugly people use it too and removed people in whatsapp. i was ignoring my meds and my social anxiety was still there. i think it is genetic, since my father has the same issue and my little brother, when i go out, my body starts to shake, my eyes could not find a spot to look at and i sweat a lot. when i try to talk i did not know what to say, my voice never go loud enough. this is another problem. if i cannot go out, i will not find a job, i cannot go to school, i cannot have fun outside being social as a teen etc. this is the point where i am now at my 90's waiting for god to end my life. my life is just stopped. i am lying at the bed in home all day. and parents yell at me all time for it but who cares. people do not like me when i am outside, they would laugh me, follow me i was even afraid of someone would go hurt me outside. i was closing every window at home so no one would see me. still, we were friends. my only fun times, talking her, calling someone for first time, playing games, laughing, talking about other people, having fun.. but oh, gray ticks. and she is online. oh yeah, she never loved me, i am nothing for her. why not go shot myself in the head right. this went for a loong time. i could not stop myself acting that toxic. its like, everything makes sense at that moment. you been lied. she is just making fun of you. hours later, i cry, apologize and the day is over. and maximum a week later, it happens again for some reason. she had enough. it was my last time doing it. i swore that i would never act like that again. and i never acted like that again. but i was still feeling it. i was trying to hold myself till it all becomes colorful again. then we met. in real life. went to their house, met their parents, went to the beach, took photos etc. it was my best day in my whole life. i am in love with her i think i must accept that. oh btw we had an ig account for me, but we both use it. its still active. we post stories etc. we could not wait to do it again. but she has another friends. it was still hurting me to see her with her friends. i would ask if she ""love them more than me"" if it was a year ago, but i got over it. that hostility feeling was always there. but i tried to hold it. sometimes i could not held and we fight again, eh.. i fight again, but we were good. untillll... today. it is special day or something next week, we was going to meet again in hers. the day started all good. she were online, not answering. i did not said anything about it, then she said ""sorry, i was texting in group, did not saw your message"" i said its ok. we talked, laughed and while we talk, my brain is like ""oh she were talking to another friend, she does not like you, you think she is having fun talking with you? after everything you have done?"" she was having fun talking me sometimes. only sometimes. i could not hold it and said ""if you were talking with someone else you can tell me, no need to hide its ok, those days are over."" she said that she is not lying, but i could not believe it. i had no ability to let myself think about it for a moment, and i were saying ""no need to hide"" etc. she went offline for 2 hours, i cried cried and she finally replied. she said that she would forgive me if i shut up. i said ok but at least tell me are we completely fine? she said .. my pain was at its peak. i told her at least tell me are we going to be fine again, i feel so bad etc. she said ""no, i do not care about you, real friend would not let me hurt, fill me with complete negativity everyday, i do not love you anymore, you hurt me and i still talk with you. just shut up we cannot be fine anymore."".. i paralyzed for a moment and asked her give me one last chance, and i will change, i will not hurt her anymore. she said ok, and now we are fine i guess. umm, people, i am not going to change. i am toxic af, i do not deserve to be alive, or live life like others. i mean it, its nothing like ""oh help me help me, should i die, yes yes i die please make me not die"".i have one last chance. i have 2 options. first one is.. suicide. i would never ever hurt her again, i would not worry about my bad look, my future, my past, people etc.... but my family would hurt along with her. she would not feel that much i think but still my family would fell down with my death. actually, only my mother and brother would. but they did not like the way i go. and if i cannot change myself, i will already kill myself at somepoint. they know that. second option is risking it. trying to change. i cannot meditate to change my personality and focus in my breathing. it is like faking it. it does not feel well. i cannot take therapy as i hate doctors as they just put me on a different ssri and anti psychotic. also do not have money for that. no, i just do not want to take therapy, it feels wrong. feels like it will not help. i feel like i cannot change.any options other than suicide you see? any suggestions? i do not know i just wanted to explain things. please do not tell me stop talking with her, i cannot. i love her more than anything. i am sorry i am being such a toxic asshole but i could even leave my family for her. except sometimes. sometimes i hurt her and myself with my feelings. but i still cannot give up of her. i love her more than anything, and i want she if not the same, just love me like she do others. but sometimes my brain says she never loved me.i am not feeling much atm, i just wish i was never born. please say something, i like to talk. i do not know, convince me to suicide if its ok here, or do the opposite with the reasons. tell me i am the most toxic asshole you ever heard of. i do not want to leave my mother with pain, but i do not want to risk it. how can i change? just, yeah. please help me. i am a horrible person.i wrote too long, apologizes. i do not want to check what i wrote second time because i am too lazy, and it does not matter anymore. i cannot give a fck if i look awkward somewhere in the text. i am already a horrible person. what would it change..thank you. -some baby acting toxic ugly asshole. hello people.",6

"on my 21st birthday i m killing myself everything in the world is grey and dull. my lows are low while i never have any highs in life, no matter what i try i genuinely can t feel happy. i ve gotten to the point where i just think i cant, i find myself questioning what i ve done to deserve to feel this way. how i ve slighted god in some way to put me through this daily mental torment. there s so much anger, so much sadness and pain within me. all i want is a friend, maybe even someone to love. since elementary school i ve been heavily bullied, that accompanied with my anti social nature and depression and i ended up being an outcast all throughout school. i thought things would get better when i graduated, i thought i d be entering a new bigger world that would give me opportunities to meet new people and finally make memories i can look back on fondly. i wish i still had that ignorant bliss as it was the one of the few times i ve felt hope. but i see now that i had only convinced myself that was the case, the world in reality is just a cold dark place that doesn t care about you with no one who will care about you in it. i ve made a deal with myself that if things don t get better by the time i turn 21, then i don t want to live anymore. as of today i ve got 389 days left, i m not going to change my mind on this. i d rather be dead than live a miserable life",2

"2020 really amplified the issues in my marriage. my husband finally came clean and let me know he would been hiding and addiction from me for years. my constant loneliness and depression finally made sense- he was unable or unwilling to be there for me while he was using. he started his recovery and we started couples therapy again, but things remained stagnant.on top of all the issues, we were not intimate anymore. he told me he was not attracted to me because i had gained weight. that was brutal to hear. i reconnected with an ex at the end of 2020. i shared my problems with him and he listened. he told me i was beautiful and that my body was perfect to him. i ate it up.. an affair was born.yesterday my husband confronted me- he would gone through my phone and seen messages with my ex. he was devastated.. packed up and left. i have been a mess. i cannot function, i cannot eat, cannot go too long without the sharp pain in my heart. our relationship was filled with toxicity, but i want him back more than anything. i feel so lost and abandoned. we face timed last night and the pain in his eyes killed me. i realized i am grasping onto the idea of a relationship that never was. i am so scared of starting over. i hope he reaches out and asks that we try to work it out, but part of me feels that i should not even if he did. please help- i am codependent and my separation is tearing me apart. my world is crumbling and i am barely holding on. my heart is hurting so much and i do not know what to do. co-dependent and clinging onto my marriage. i feel so alone.",6
"using an old throwaway account. i am 33, located in the us, and i have had anxiety issues for quite a long time. i should have started therapy when i was 18. recently i have been trending much more towards depression, and i need to address it now. my questions are how do i find a therapist?what is the average cost? i created an account for my insurances website to see my plan and it does not look like they cover it at all.there are different types of therapy? how can i tell what type of therapist to use?i am sure i will think of more but i am having a hard time concentrating. like i said, anxiety issues up the wazoo. had them for most of my life but i think it got much worse after a bad salvia trip around 10 years ago, but that is not important. i have an extremely hard time discussing and articulating my emotions. the last few weeks i began having intrusive thoughts about suicide hello hotline bot, i am safe now but i like that you are here anyway . i have most definitely also lost interest in the things in my life that brought me joy, and the past week my appetite has gotten markedly lower. so yeah, depression. a little over a week ago i had a yearly physical but i guess my answers to their mental health questionnaire did not raise any alarms and i was scared to ask how to go about starting therapy.on to my little rant, at the start of april a coworker invited me out to get drinks and we hit it off amazingly. i am actually one of her supervisors so we had to keep it hush hush at work. texted constantly for the first few weeks, neither of us had felt that kind of connection to someone else before. conversation that flowed from one topic to the next, from getting out of work at 5 or 6 until going to bed around 1. we also saw each other outside of work at least every other day. that pace kept up for about a month, maybe got a little slower through may.by june we were seeing each other less and while texting nearly every day we are talking much less, and i feel my apprehension to discussing my feelings is the because. i care deeply about her and i do not want to lose her because i am unable to talk seriously about us. add to that having to see her at work every day and i am a mess of emotions, which have really boiled over the last couple days. it was my birthday on saturday and i spent most of it crying in my room, dreading having to respond to the birthday wishes i was receiving. this evening i asked her when i could see her next, and did not get a reply. four hours later i asked if we could talk and was again met with silence. i am not the type to incessantly send messages hoping to annoy or guilt someone into responding so i left it at that, but in the words of tom petty, the waiting is the hardest part. i do not know what exactly i am looking to accomplish with this post. i have a good amount of friends but i do not have a best friend that i can confide in and talk to about things like this. i am just a mess of a human right now, and i think my brain is trying to go in so many directions that i cannot even have a good cry, even though i think that is what i want in this moment. questions about starting therapy and a little rant",2

"so this is my first time posting on reddit, apologies if i mess up. to make a long story short, i failed my first year of college. my parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but i know they love me so i try to not put it against them. so my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. thing is, after covid restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. i was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. i failed most of my classes both semesters. i am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but i did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. they are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. i do not know if they will find out i failed this year or not, but either way i feel that i am such a horrible child, even if i cannot help my mental illness i could have reached out. i do not even want to go to college anymore. i do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, i want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans. i cannot go on, i feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work. why did not i do it? what is wrong with me? i hate myself so much, why cannot i just be a good child to my parents? i cannot do anything right so i feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated i am such a horrible child",6
"so i drank wine and i started crying and since my husband was constantly telling me that i ruined his life and he regrets being married to me and i'm the devil and blah blah, for the first time in my life i picked up the knife and i thought i should just kill my self. when my husband saw me he started screaming and snatched the knife away from me and said i am trying to get him into trouble by committing suicide. he kicked me and spat on me. i kept on try to explain to him that i can't take him blaming me for everything and he believes everything he says so hard that every works out of my mouth is a lie. i tried telling him i am trying to fix myself.",5

"covid did a real number on me in terms of my mental health, for the past year and a half i have felt isolated, lonely, self conscious etc. i have begun smoking copious amounts of marijuana and drinking to help at times with boredom sadness and i am only 16. i have been on my meds since december and they have helped in ways but its still so difficult to keep going. today i woke up to both my mom and brother panicking that they could not find our cat of four years. our first cat we have ever had and she is been with us for so many journeys and has been a loving companion. we live on a farm with many outdoor cats but we would not let our indoor cats out as often because they did not mingle well with the others. well our indoor cat, she got out last night because of me. because i am too selfish and greedy that i could not leave it for one night and had to go smoke, my dumbass left the door open and she left at some point. we have searched all day to no avail, i can tell my brother resents me for this i understand what hes feeling but it still does not take away the pain nor the guilt of losing her. i am not even man enough to admit that i was smoking and that is why she got out. my mom keeps telling me this is a natural part of life and that she suspected that she may have been sick anyways, still does not hurt any less. i have been suicidal for a little while now but to chicken to do anything about it but honestly this was the last thing i needed and it may have been the thing to push me over the edge. i am just so sad and miss her so much already. i do not know if i am going to do it but i am just so done with life and all the shit that is been thrown my way. sorry for the rant been needing to vent and do not have a therapist to do so with. thanks for reading.-n i think i am going to kill myself",2

"this is a throwaway account and i am a teenager so please, ignore the edgy username.when you think about it, life is meaningless. we were born in a universe billions of years old theoretically and, will exist for trillions of more. it is literally impossible for us to determine its vastness everything living in it currently to out knowledge, just earthlings are mere chuck on molecules and chemical reactions that are keeping us alive. the very act of thinking is fundamentally just a chemical reaction--a electronic charge in our brain.of course, if the universe has a meaning or not has nothing to do with our individual meaning and enjoyment of life, which brings me to my problem. for the last 5 years i fell into the hole of nihilism.we have found comfort many concepts and ideology, such as religion or family, friends and our loved-ones. some believe that the existence of life is in itself, worth living. for me, those concepts arrive at dead-end whenever i question it further. it becomes irrelevant. the idea of good or evil, true or false becomes nothing. i think everybody, deep-down understands this fact--chooses to ignore it from the existential horror and anxiety it brings. personally, these artificial constructs has no effect on the reality that we all face--the reality i feel.look at how far we have came. the economical, scientifical and technological advancement we has made that allowed us to connect through digitally. yet, what is the point, really? reality is when you die nothing will exist any longer. if you try to give death a mathematical equation, it will be 0 infinity. no time has passed but every time there will be has passes as well. it is like an escape to the inescapable curse that is nihilism. once you see it you can never unsee it.i do not understand why i do not want to die, yet wants to die so badly. i do not even know what to write on the title.",6

"i'm a musicologist with 10 years working on the correlation between audio and the brain. i've created a playlist with the most proven relaxing music out there. this will help ease stress, anxiety and help you be in the moment. hope this reach as many as possible hi there, so this playlist available at both apple music and spotify came to life almost a year ago, when i'd finished researching the effects of listening to nature sounds. easily explained you may have heard about our inherited fight-or-flight response system, which is a major factor in stress and anxiety. well, research has shown that listening to nature sounds triggers the opposite system, called rest-or-digest, which helps lowering your heart rate, ease tightening muscles and enable you to focus on fewer things. these system is, just like our f-o-f response, is inherited from our ancestors. we believe that reason behind nature sounds triggering this is that hearing birds, rain etc meant positive things for the caveman generations. birds singing meant that there were no large predators around as well as good soil , rain meant crops would grow, fire that they would survive the night and so on. hope this helps everyone it reaches! link to playlist spotify and apple",5

"dae have extreme anxiety in professional performance settings? i have a huge problem with anxiety at work and have very big problems with avoidance. my emotional difficulties have gotten to the point many times where i have made absolutely awful mistakes at work and have been too panicked incapacitated cowardly to take responsibility for myself. it s become a negative cycle spanning years and i never seem to get better. it s decimated my self esteem and riddled my life with stress and anxiety, and of course imposter syndrome in every professional situation with any decent level of responsibility. under pressure i don t push through and rise to the challenge, i completely choke and take my hands off the wheel in panic-avoidance, causing car crash situations and so much stress to those who manage me. if i wasn t working with family i would be fired and destitute as i feel i can t be trusted with anything. everyone in my circle is very smart and high functioning, and can take responsibility for themselves and be relied upon to get their jobs done. i m 30 and i can t take myself seriously as an adult. i suppose what i want to ask, is if any of this resonates with you guys? i m just lost as to what is wrong with me to be so ineffectual and i feel so much shame. apologies for the rant.",4

"i have had what is likely depression for about 3 years now. i do not know why it came about, and i do not understand why its going away. but its wrong, and i do not want to get better.i am so used to the familiarity of it. there was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numb-emptiness, or just plain heaviness. i had my low times, i self-harmed, and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill, the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. it was reliable. it was known. it made the highs feel better.but for a few months now, i have been, by most views, improving. i have less depressive episodes. it went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. the sadness behind the self-harm is fading, and as it does, the strength of temptations grows weaker.and yet, i cling to what remains. i am not ready to get better. i am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. the depression is part of who i am at this point, and i do not know how to live without it. perhaps because my depression never had a clear because, there is no closure, nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.i am here because my partner suggested i ask if anyone else has experience with this. i am not really sure how much you all will know of this, but its worth a shot. thank you in advance. i am getting better, and i hate it.",2
"it is 1 pm, i am still in bed and believe me or not, i feel like crying because i do not want to get up. i do not have much to do today, i just have a therapist appointment and i am happy to see him after 2 weeks but that also means that i will not be able to sleep this evening and it makes me feel sick... also tomorrow i will go out with friends and i should be happy about it because i had a lot of fun last time and i could not wait to see them again but guess what... it makes me anxious because i will not be able to sleep in the evening. sometimes i think that the time i spend sleeping or just in my bed hugging the pillow is the only thing that pushes me to keep going. maybe it would not be so bad if i did not live with my father, considering that sometimes i do not want to get out of bed just because i do not feel ready to face him and my grandma teasing me and treating me like a child. i feel that this discomfort would be a little less strong if i could just take my time to do things like having lunch, organizing work in the evening, going to bed eccetera instead of having to respect other's times, noise and teasing all day long, but that is another story... i just want to sleep",2

"hi everyone. hope everyone is having a good day. during 2020, i was officially diagnosed with depression. i have always had symptoms of depression and most likely should have been medicated long beforehand, but during quarantine my symptoms skyrocketed and i needed to get help. i began seeing a therapist, she diagnosed me and recommended zoloft as my treatment and for several months so far so good. but as of june my symptoms have gotten worse then what originally caused me to seek help. i am almost constantly sad and suicide is a frequent thought in my mind. i am not actively planning but there are times where i will have a thought to just do it then. and now, as of last week, i have almost no energy, no real drive to do almost anything and i have no interest in almost anything. all i do is sleep, work and eat. that is it and just thinking about it makes me extremely depressed.yesterday i called out of work telling them i was not feeling well and i just needed the day. i slept for almost 14 hours last night and i woke up with no energy and i was nauseous. i went in to work today and my manager quickly sent me home because of my symptoms and he thinks its covid but i have not gotten the courage to tell him i have depression because him and the rest of my work are not exactly the most progressive when i comes to mental health. on the car ride home i made the realization that i have gotten to the point that my depression has directly effected my life and now i feel worse then i have yet. i am not asking for help. if anything this is just me venting. but today really sucked. today was the first day i was sent home from work because of my depression.",2

"do you guys try to avoid people you know, or just people you don't know? i used to be anxious about being around strangers, but now i don't really care as much. but i always get way more anxious at the thought of meeting people i do know and i try to avoid them as much as i can. i don't even see any value in forming friendships relationships anymore. i try open up as little as possible to people. the more i get to know them, the more i try to avoid them. i fear that friendships come with unrealistic expectations and that as people get to know me they'll realise that i'm weird and will gradually dislike me, and maybe try to make me feel guilty for not meeting their expectations. i also don't want to become dependent on other people, cos it seems like most 'friends' only seem to care about you when it suits them. i just think most friendships are fake and over-rated.",4
"child protective services were called and i was interviewed. i told them nothing of the sexual abuse, only the physical and emotional, as well as his constant threats to ""break your arm in that goddamn door if you don't sit fucking still"" i was removed from my home in two days and placed in a foster home until my biological father could drive up and take me to what was supposed to be my real home. on my mothers side of the family i have an aunty and my nene along with various cousins. my father kept me separated from them for two years, finally relenting when i cried and begged to see them.",5

so some will remember a post i made about a certain wall. and me having kicked it. my job said they would not hold it against me but had to move me to another post. this post sucks. i literally asked my boss if i am being punished. he said i was not but it feels like i could be. no one comes in on time and no one stays long and leaves us in a lurch. my schedule is erratic and at this point i have left late as much as i have on time. have i payed my penance? has work been shitty enough that i can stop feeling bad about the only bad thing i have done at my job notice i have never been late or missed a shift. work blues,2
"and i am struggling with survivors guilt. we were 19. i blame myself every day for being the catalyst. we had a pretty decent friends group, she was in love with a mutual best friend of ours that i had known since kindergarten. that friend said that they might have had a chance in the past but never again, and when i told her that she took a turn for the worst mentally. i missed her call the day before she killed herself and i blame myself for not answering. i blame myself for not following through with our pact and being too cowardly. now i have got a family and two years ago i got a kidney transplant, but i just sit here and think about how i do not deserve it and i should not be here. how people like me do not deserve to be happy. the things id do to trade places and me be dead and my best friend still be alivei fucking hate feeling like this and not having anyone to talk to about it. my best friend and i had a pact, she killed herself 9 years ago today.",6
"recently i have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity i have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, i absolutely hate the work that i have to do. ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while i am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. however this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and i do not think i have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like i did during the pandemic in my life. besides work and work again though on my 2 days off i either read or stay in my hotel room. have got absolutely no one to do anything with. go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than i am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. and i am stuck. because even though i feel like i cannot stay here any much longer i know for sure i can not go back home. because as little as i have here, i literally do not have anything back home. no friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. and that makes me feel like i am completely missing out on life, at 23 when i should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, i feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. i just can not fathom why seemingly i can not have a more active life. what is painful is that i am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what i try or where i end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since i have graduated high-school. i honestly just do not know what to do anymore. where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. a huge part of why i am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that i am not able to do what i am really passionate about professionally. the school i ended up going to was a plan b. i have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though i was hopeful i have knew i would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan b's is not it? i think that is exactly the reason why i am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. i have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that i know i am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. i have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and i do not think there is anything that i would want to do more than film-making. unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad i just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing i know in my bones i would be good at. it is hard to explain but i just feel it. what i am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing i would want to do, but cannot. it consumes me how much i would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. and accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though i have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. lastly i just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though i love reading, books make me feel even worse. i have been reading a lot of ya and they all depict a reality i would like to find myself in. all the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements i am missing and have always been missing from my life. and this is exactly why i feel like i do not belong. i feel things differently. maybe i just feel more. people nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. i have got so much life in me and things i would want to do, places i would want to visit but here i am. maybe i am just delusional, maybe i have high-functioning depression, i have been thinking about therapy a lot but i just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life i would like to have. i just feel like i am not right for this world, i honestly do and even though i am not suicidal and i would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. as if tomorrow i would be told i have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life i would know where everything is headed to. this one and a half year for some reason i can not begin to tell you how much i have thought of that. anyhow, thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! i think i am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world",6
"honestly it feels like i put more effort into everything. its tiring. i just wish people will give me the same energy, i am at my lowest, and i do not feel fine anymore. i cannot keep lying to my self. i do have partners friends. but why does it feel so dry. everyone else is experiencing exciting things all the time. why cannot i have that feeling. i do not know anymore, i am just crying. i feel worthless. i feel like, i do way too much. life is fucking dry.",6

"this past month, i have been more depressed than usual. again. and it sucks. sometimes ill notice tiny changes in my habits, routines, or diet and ill just go with the flow, but sometimes it comes suddenly and i will not be able to do anything about it. i feel so glazed all the time.i have not reached out to anyone because i find it so annoying. i find all of this and myself so annoying. its tiring. exhausting. to keep telling people about what is going on and why were like this. i have told a few people in the past and it did not really help and i have stopped since then because i am tired and so what? even writing this is a pain.you know what i realized about myself a few days ago? i have a lot of hobbies to suppress my thoughts. if a certain activity does not work, ill move on to the next one. i keep going in this cycle until i find one that will. and that is scary. it is scary constantly trying to avoid yourself. anyone do this as well? please let me know i am not alone. lol. i find myself annoying when i talk to others about my depression",2

"dr. s office blew up my phone about results of blood test i ve been suffering from health anxiety for a few months now after a lymes disease scare in november. i found myself fine tuned to any aches pains in my body at this time out of paranoia of getting lymes disease. after my blood test came back negative, i still felt these aches and pains and now started to attribute them to severe diseases, like cancer, and driving myself crazy. these pains seem to be deep in my bone and very painful, but i simply don t know if they re psychosomatic or real. i find it hard to believe i could imagine these pains, but at the same time i didn t feel these pains before my scare back in november. i finally went to get a physical for the first time in 4 years last week and also requested a blood test. fast forward to today, an unknown number called me 4 times and left a message the last time. it was the dr. s office notifying me my blood results came in. i feel very uneasy about this... why not call once and leave a message? the multiple calls are freaking me out and makes me feel the results are really bad. also, does anyone know if my lyme blood tests would ve tested for cancer as well? i m 22 years old if this helps btw. thank you!",0

wow for days i have been worried about this and now that i have less then 24 hours i some how feel good more calm then i have been in a long time i am still scared but i am looking forward to it i will be leaving 2 notes 1 at my house and 1 on my body not saying goodbye to anyone in particular just bye because i the truth is i cut off everyone myself because i knew this time was coming and i did not want anyone to feel hurt because i was dead so for years i have worked on being as alone as possible i thought my parents abused me my mum would constantly tell me how dumb i was and i would burn in hell my dad was a angry person that beat my mum my earliest memory is of him hitting my mum. as my mum would put it years later i would not go to sleep without a beating in other words every night i got a beating for one reason or another. but this all was not true for my brothers at least that is what i believed my school life was bad i am dyslexic af and i used to be the small weak kid so i got bullied constantly really badly to the point teachers joined in on it as well so i got low grades and extra beatings until i got into college where i stopped getting bullied but i was 18 and never had a frienda year and half after that at the age of 20 my dad died that then my mum got depressed so i quit college and started to work 2 jobs to help support my mum and brothers a year and a half after that my mum died that was sad idk why i never liked her so instead of dealing with these emotions i did what my dad told me buried the emotions deep inside they used to boil up in the form of angeri went and got another 2 jobs i was on average sleeping 2-4 hours per night working non stop to support my brothers because that is what was expected of me i got engaged by the age of 23 through some arranged marriage my uncles and auntie set up but a week before the marriage my older brother told me he put me in a ton of debt almost 100k so my marriage got called offi had 2 in my account i was 25 by this point i tried to get back on the grind again but i could not my older brother left i could not bring myself to take him to court and over the years everyone told me my older brother was fing me over even my younger brother was crying saying to me he is fing you over i did not listen now i cannot look them in the eyes but now both of them have completed university i do not know what they do but they have jobs where you wear a suiti never gave any time to myself it was always about what was expected of me. yeah i know sounds like a easy life but i feel burnt out always getting kicked down i did grow to be empathetic because nobody showed me any this is my life pathetic human that did nothing in his life and will die at 29 with nothing 24 hours to go my life,6
"i feel like i shouldn't be allowed to exist because of how disgusting i am really stupid rant vent incoming i truly believe i am the most horrendous creature on this earth. i wouldn't even call myself human because i'm so monstrous i feel i don't resemble one. it should be considered a crime for me to expose my appearance to other people. no one deserves to look at such a disgusting thing. i don't deserve to be alive. those thoughts are always in the back of my head. sometimes i'll look at myself and feel confused because i don't understand how i could feel like that. i look normal. even pretty sometimes. and other times i'll look at myself and cry and scream and vomit because of how hideous i am. i don't understand why i have to hate myself so much. how can my feelings change so much? how can i be okay with who i am one moment and want to die because of how i look the next? i can't even trust my eyes to know how i look. i don't know if i'm pretty and i don't know if i'm hideous. and i can't ask anyone because i know every answer other than ""you're disgusting"" will make me think they're lying to make me feel better. when i see someone look at me, i know they're thinking of me. thinking how can a human look this grotesque. despising me. hating me because my existence forced them to look at me. i don't ever want to go outside because i know i'm being looked at and being watched and being hated. i'm so tired. i've been in therapy since i was 6 because of things like this. 13 years of therapy hasn't helped one bit. in fact, i hate myself even more. because wouldn't constant lessons change my mind a bit if i was actually wrong? so i must be right. i haven't been to a doctor since october but i have made an appointment for next month. i don't know if i can last that long. i've covered up all the mirrors and windows in my house and i've covered the cameras on my phone and computer. there are 3 people i can stand looking at me. i have to leave the house next sunday and the sunday after that. how can i do that when i'll be subjecting everyone around me to look at a monster? i'm so tired of this",1
"i am 16 and i really want to die but i am afraid that i am going to have a failed attempt and my life's going to get worse. i wish i did not have to think this way, i wish my parents let me study what i wanted so i was not such a failure and a disappointment to them. in the beginning of this year, i broke down and told my mother that i could not concentrate on my studies no matter how hard i tried and that i did not think i would be capable to study science in grade 11 but she did not listen to me. she told my father and he did nothing but berate me and they told me that if i act crazy again, they would punish me. i am very scared of disappointing people but no matter how hard i try, i end up doing just that. i cannot back away from anything now, my courses have been paid for and they are really expensive and i do not think my parents could afford losing all that money. even if they could recuperate, i am certain that they are going to make my life hell and not allow me to change to any other course. i really wanted to study literature and i was really fond of reading books and learning languages, but all the pressure to be something i am not made me lose the will to even pick up a book and i do not feel interested in doing anything anymore. i used to be good at english and writing papers and loved learning but now i am barely even passing english. i do not have a way to fix this and neither do i have a way out. i feel like a failure around people my age because they seem to have set their mind on what they are studying and are excelling. my parents want me to sit for the national medical entrance test which is in 1.5 yrs but i know i am going to fail it and i have nothing i can do after that. i am tired of feeling like a failure, i am tired of pretending i am trying my best, i am not trying at all, i cannot try. i just want all this to stop. i do not want to keep on lying to everyone around me but i am too scared to kill myself.",6
why fucking why do we have to keep suffering like what in the world have we done that was so bad. i just want to feel better i want to feel better and be able to accept that too but i cannot seem to. i am at my wits end i am just so incredibly sick and tired of it i just want my life back or a life back. its that or out done finished cannot bear it feel like every morning i am losing and i feel awful for that because i know there is people much worse than me who are desperately clinging to life. how bloody dare i but i just cannot help it i cannot and i want to i want to be better and not just for me. oh ffs sake here we go again the fight begins. here we go again i guess for another anxiety fuelled day fuck sake one morning i just want to wake up and feel settled and calm and normal.,6

"question i ve been very conflicted the last several days. i started vraylar 5 days ago and have noticed since that i ve been feeling small charges of minor, anxious energy and even more minor things happening during my sleep. today i went further and got my usual hypomania symptoms warmth pressure in chest, random thoughts, forgetting thoughts, many ideas but it was still more minor than my last episode and lasted shortly under an hour . my last episode btw, also seemed to include rapid cycling and maybe mixed states. i would cycle between hm, normal, or depression in one day or under a day and have symptoms of all 3 during hm. the previous episode which was my first a year ago, wasn t like this. sure i had the energy spikes here and there but it wasn t nearly as intense in symptoms and i didn t cycle between depression, just crashed into it at the end. and boooyy that was my worst depressive episode yet . anyhow after this recent episode, i crashed into bad depression with suicidal thoughts then went baseline and have been that way till the last few days. my question is- is the vraylar causing hypomania or have i progressed into rapid cycling due to my illness being untreated for a year and the meds are helping it, which is why it s so minor? i know this is a lot but damn, this is confusing and worrisome",1

"over the past year i have lost every single one of my friends. most were friends that were insignificant and i was not impacted by my loss. but 2 of the people i cared about most, one recently, completely ghosted me and left my life so fast its like they were not even there in the first place. i do not know what it is about me that repels people. so many of my old friends who completely betrayed me and fucked up my life and my self image are out with their own friends living their lives and having fun. and i am at home, sleeping in every day so i do not have to face my own loneliness. my best friend moved a state away a few years ago and were growing more distant every day. my boyfriend and i are on and off, and i have no one to rely on at all. i never thought i would face true loneliness but i am and its worse than anything i could have ever imagined. i do not see a point in living this way when no one cares about me. some people say oh i have no friends i am so alone when they really are not and they do not really know what true loneliness is like. seeing people i care about and getting out of the house helps my depression become more manageable but all summer i have been alone and at one of the worst points in my life and i genuinely do not know what to do. i have rotated through everyone around me that id even slightly get along with and i feel like there is nothing else for me to do. no one really cares until you are dead. i am so alone",2
"i guess this is less about suicide and more about using self harm to hold myself from committing suicide, but suicide is on my mind too because it seems like that is the only way i could honestly get out of this situation. basically i work in retail but we are almost always short staffed so they have come to depend on me for certain things. however this had taken a toll on my mental health i was already prone to depression and suicidal thoughts, but i thought i learned to manage them before taking this job . back in december, i began cutting, something i had never done before that point. i was able to stop myself in february and told myself i would work for 6 more months and then quit for the sake of my sanity. however in june, the store lost 3 workers who were considered very reliable and in this week, we lost 3 more. it is a dog job so i do not blame them, but because they are leaving, the management puts more on me. in these last few shifts, i have felt like i am on the verge of a breakdown. i am not even being paid 10 an hour. i am always sore and stiff from standing bent over for 9 hours processing product in a stockroom . and customer service is self explanatory. it is draining and lately i have been feeling like the only way i keep going without killing myself is to cut myself. my family agrees that i should quit and move on. however it is hard for me to approach any of management about it because i know they will try to negotiate with me i am one of two associates who have been there for more than a year the rest are all new with the oldest being two months or try to guilt trip me, which could make the final two weeks awkward. and i do not think it is smart to say 'this job is making me self harm suicidal'. i just do not know how to power through this situation without physically hurting myself. feeling trapped at job",6

medical marijuana- does it help or hurt? i have a few diagnosed mental health conditions. i was diagnosed with adhd and anxiety as a child and cyclothymia as an adult. my current therapist sees bpd traits too. i changed psychiatric care providers and during my intake appointment the aprn suggested medical marijuana. they told me it would increase the efficacy of the stimulant and mood stabilizer i am on. they also claimed they would be able to replace the benzos i dislike taking. my childhood was absolutely difficult but i don't really see how it would result in ptsd the only psychiatric condition that medical marijuana is approved for in my state i am looking for studies and information about the use of medical marijuana in combination with traditional psychiatric care and therapy. is there any validity to the claims it will help boost my medication? i am quite interested in cbd for anxiety. i have used marijuana in the past recreationally and of course i like it. just this fact makes me feel like a big phony. i'm concerned but mostly because i can't find much research on it. any help is appreciated.,1

i have this constant thought hanging over my head that at all time somehow i m not using my time wisely regardless of what it is if i m taking a relaxing bath to calm my nerve i think about how i could be doing something even more fun or exciting and this task is not worth the time i m spending on it i often have morning where i find myself unable to fall back asleep even if i m awake way earlier than i need to be for work plan that day lamenting how i am or am not using that time to my best advantage it make it so hard to enjoy my day off or the time i don t spend occupied with something sometimes my day off are stressful the most at the very end when i reflect back on all the thing i didn t do but should have done even if that s total nonsense to a clearer headed me there s nothing i have to do on a day off i m sitting here right this second looking at the clock over and over thinking i wasted the last 0 minute watching youtube video when i could ve been playing video game but when i play video game instead i feel bad about not having watched a movie or new tv show instead it s so maddening ha anyone found a way to manage this constant sense of impatience,2

"sorry in advance for lengthy post. to start, my husband 41 amp i 40 have been together for about 25 years. i have gone through dark stages in my life. suicidal thoughts failed attempts. i used work as a coping method but i did not get anywhere with my work. still a manager while an account assistant i worked with 10 years ago is now a director. due to unexpected post partum complication, i was hospitalized after giving birth. hormone roller coaster. zero visitors b c of covid. finally was on antidepressant. i stopped them after hospital discharge. fast forward to now, i start to feel that our marriage and feelings for each other has changed. i understand dynamics change with a baby but why do i always feel hes cheating? sex life is nonexistent since pregnancy. we were both very excited and blessed with this child as conceiving was difficult. the happiest moment in our lives became the saddest at the same time. enduring the pain of not being able to see my newborn meanwhile , he took care of our baby himself. its as if we fought our own battles. it was not easy for both of us amp i thought it would only make us stronger. yet why do i feel the opposite?i have had similar episodes before where i feel our marriage is failing amp all i wanted was to leave this world. i have started having same sad feelings. sensitivity level is high. quickly boils down to a failed relationship. he has not been sleeping well the past few days. the other day he suddenly woke up and went for his morning walk with the dog. typically, wed go together. i called him as i could not see him at the park. finally he came back and i asked him where he was amp that i called him five times. he pulled out his phone amp said he had it on silent somehow. i do not know why my first instinct was that he met up with someone. maybe because his walk was much longer than usual? i know hes been bothered by work lately but my first thought his insomnia was possibly because this other woman is pregnant or something ? yesterday was tough. i was sick to my stomach with the feeling hes definitely seeing someone. i was quite certain hell leave us. that he has already forgotten about our baby, our love, our excitement when we first learned of the news. thoughts came rushing in. sadness swelled up my body. i had thoughts of leaving, i craved alcohol and had a few sips. the feeling of leaving this world was strong. the emptiness. the feeling that you have lost everything. the pain of feeling sorry for bringing my child here. the disgusted feeling of being weak and feeling like a coward. i am not even qualified to be a mom and my baby will be better off without me. our baby turned one and still young so maybe husband will be able to find a better mom. and while holding my baby to sleep, i asked if i can bear not being able to see the beautiful smile, hear the laughter and chuckles. and as the thoughts came about, they flooded my eyes. i feel i am doing more harm than good to my baby. will my baby forgive me? knowing its probably better developmentally , does it matter if i am forgiven?perhaps it would have been better for everyone if i had just died with the complication last year. tired of battling in my head",2

"i can t sustain long conversations it doesn t matter who the other person is, if we are engaged in a conversation, the longer it takes the more symptoms i get. at first i am ok, then the worry begins in my head where at the same time i am talking, i start observing myself. the conversation continues but at this time the symptoms i have been worried about begin to appear, my ears turn red, my lips start to shake, my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time i start observing that the person i am talking to has now noticed that i am having a reaction. my voice start to tremble as i must make some type of escape. shame overtakes me as i now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. i abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person, this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. later on as days pass, i start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. after sometime, i start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. if it is a place of employment, over time i will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so i quit so i can start fresh somewhere else but i already know what the outcome will be at each new place. i am 56 and have been like that since high school. some medications have helped, particularly effexor. also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously, but many times i forget to do the work and i get the episodes. this is all from times in my childhood where i was shamed in front of others and ridiculed by aunts, uncles, grandparents and teachers. one of my grandma s used to on many occasions take her frustrations on me when i did something bad. so for some reason now, when i talk to other adults, it triggers all of the reactions i had as a child when i was getting yelled at.",4

"how does one exist in a reality where the thing that ultimately governs it and your existence within it is something you truly hold no motivation to acquire? money is nice, money buys me things i like, money feeds me, but if i have to do things i am not passionate about for money, id rather cease to exist. what is a life lived, if not lived every single second chasing the things that make your heart flutter. what is the worth of an existence that you are plunged into without your choosing yet are confined to its realities otherwise you die? many would say these are the ramblings of a child, who is experienced nothing at all. nobody to provide for. if i have no will to provide for myself, how could i possibly obtain the will to provide for someone else? i am all i want in life, i do not need to lean on another. what is maturity? why are their limits? i think of being confined within this reality and i detest it i refuse to be boxed in and conform. if my passions bring me wealth, then by chance ill live a full life. if they do not, ill continue them until i starve. i have no fear of death or the inevitable end that awaits someone of my mindset, i am more ecstatic ill be spending every second of my time chasing my dreams until my bell tolls or until i cannot chase them any longer and i pull the curtains early. how does one exist in a reality in which the thing that ultimately governs it is something you have no desire to acquire whatsoever. a question... a few actually...",6

"where do i begin to get help? i'm a 27 year old female. i've probably had anxiety all my life but have never spoken to a doctor or anyone about it. i feel like im just always in a constant state of worry. so much so that it drives me to have small ocd traits. something as simple as fearing a house fire and having to do a series of steps checking lights before i leave the house. over and over......and over again. it's weird. i'm always worrying about the future, past things i can't change, things i say or do after im with people, how people view me, if i have a ""too much"" gene. i'll sit and agonize over things that's so mild for someone to worry about but drives me up a wall. to the point of frustration where i just lose it and cry into a panic. i dont even know where to start to solve this. i feel like the past year it's been horrendous and getting increasingly worse. i'm good at playing it off. i'm good at putting on a show because i've always thought i could handle it- lots of people i know feel the same. but it's really starting to take a toll on my life and the things i'm doing or too afraid to even try to do. i feel like i use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. not an outrageous amount but i'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause i've worried myself into thinking i have a problem and need self control. i'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but i feel like my mind is just in a dark place. telling myself i'll never make it, that i'll always be alone, etc. it's really stupid things to stress over. or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason i think i've never gone to get help. i'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help i need or where to even go. not to mention the fear i get trying to explain how i feel to someone and them thinking i'm crazy or i'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me.... i just feel like if i dont try to improve my overall mindset towards life then i wont have a fulfilling one. i'll be too afraid to try new things that scare me, i'll stick to my same safe routine, and i'll come home and cry over the big and small worries that run through my head daily. where i do i start to fix this...?",0

"i think i have bone cancer im 20 years old male and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem. ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. i was certian i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. i decided not to have it removed. two years later this last summer i started have muscle twitches all over my body. those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine. anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts. my pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various stds and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. and idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives. i usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds in muscle over the last 6 months. what i really want to know is there any possibility that this isnt serious? and for those wondering i'm going to the doctor to get this checked out as soon as im back in town. also i stopped taking my adhd meds about a month ago that id been taking for 5 years",0

"hey guys, i m31 have been depressed as long as i can remember, but realized it just 7 years ago. until then i thought everybody must feel like this and that i was just weak. since then i was in therapy 3 times. had panic attacks and 2 burn outs. i feel miserable most of the time and have suicidal thoughts every few weeks. when i started therapy for the first time, i felt really great afterwards and i thought ""great, that is it. i have the positive thinking in place and can move on with my life."" that was at the end of university. i also met my girlfriend at this time and was as happy as never before in my life.i started with a lot of energy into my first job in a small company and worked my way up from technician to a management position within 2 years.at the end i was under constant tension and my stomach hurt all the time. i thought a raise would give me the motivation to keep on going. but i quit the day after i got a 20 raise, because i realized that i did not feel anything changing in this moment. i went to the doctor, because i felt miserable and he told me, i had a burnout. i was sick for a month and could almost only lie in bed and do nothing else.after this has happened, i started a therapy again for a few months. fast forward 3 years. i try not to overwork myself, but i am in a constant spiral of being angry, feeling miserable, feeling weak overworked and wanting to quit whatever i am doing, i often just wish to disappear. my relationship is suffering a lot from this, because i can not see any perspective to lead a normal life, if i keep on breaking down every 6 months.my father had a stroke, a few weeks ago and died after 10 days in the hospital where i visited him every day. when i heard about his stroke, i was worried of course, but at the same time i suddenly had energy, focus and the will to change things in my life. i wanted to learn from his mistakes. this held for a few weeks. a few weeks have passed since the funeral and i feel as miserable as before. it feels strange that i actually felt so good when there was an actual reason to feel bad.since my last breakdown, i started to mistrust my judgemental skills. this constant rollercoaster of feelings really freaks me out. i want to have children with my girlfriend in a few years, but i am so scared to just not be able to provide for a family or be a bad parent with this condition.i just made an appointment to apply for another therapy, but i actually lost hope that anything is ever going to help. there would be so many more details to tell about that do not fit into this thread.has anybody actually defeated depression or is it going to be a constant battle for the rest of my life? i am just so tired. i do not know how to go on with my life",2
"i struggle with these thoughts frequently but i have come to the conclusion that i am only here because my son and a few specific people in my life. i am optimistic for someone who struggles with these thoughts as often as i do. i just feel stuck. i am stuck on this world because i love my son so so much i would never put that trauma on him, he needs his mom. but i also feel stuck because i cope with sleep. i used to be able to sleep hours everyday to pass the time and i cannot anymore because i work full time at a really good paying job. no job no home and i cannot do that to my son. i just want to go off into the woods and set up camp away from everyone and really figure out my life or if i want one but i cannot. so i am stuck. this is just a rant but its so hard being in my head. its hard to have ties to the world",6

"i do not understand how anyone can say that life is a gift ?like holy shit moron did you actually ever stopped for a second to take a look at how we are all living ? so hey let me just enumerate some reasons why life really sucks -first of all most of your ""free"" time does not actually belong to you. you are born in this shit-ass world and then adults just throw you against your will in elementary school and then high school just so the teachers there can brainwash you, in other words transform you into a submitted and obedient wage-slave while you are young so that you are ready to get into the workforce later on once you are 18. and well eventually you can also keep up the brainwashing even further, if that is pleasing you, in university. -and hey i just forgot a detail, if you dare display any difference from the other kids, no matter how small and insignificant it is, you might aswell get bullied and beaten on early on in life, are not that a great thing ! -and then once you become an adult yourself you are going to live your life with all the accumulated trauma during childhood and adolescence if you were unlucky enough to endure any of it. now you will get to enjoy the magnificent modern capitalist society and lifestyle that the sociopaths psychopaths at the top are forcing us to live in. you will now waste your time at a job and a company you do not give a shit about for at least 8 hours a day, 5 days a week for 45 years until you are too old to work anymore, and then you are going to slowly rot away at a retirement home because you do not have any energy left to do anything you actually enjoy...and of course if you dare display any symptoms of anxiety or depression during your life, which quite honestly, seems like a perfectly reasonable way for anybody to react in the face of this boring dystopia we are living in, at best people are going to tell you to go and see a psychiatrist therapist, because of course the average neuro-fucking-typical person is actually perfectly well-adapted to this garbage-tier system and actually somehow never really suffered from it.or if you are unlucky enough, people are going to call you ""crazy"" ""lazy"" ""ungrateful"" and what other adjectives to describe you are ""shitty"" behavior. i mean wow, you are such an ungrateful piece of shit dude, you should be proud that the ceo psychopaths at the top are giving us the opportunity to slave our time and our lives away for their company !i swear to fucking god, there is not a single second, minute, or hour that i am not spending on this fucking earth wishing to kill myself and most of all that i was never born in the first place, because if i knew that i would be living in this shitty capitalistic system, it would have been way better and less painful if someone took a fucking axe and just sliced me inside my mother's belly.everyhing in this fucking life sucks from my point of view. our way of living sucks, people suck, hell even i suck for being this fucking depressed everyday, i am so fucking tired of it. nobody is going to be able to fix me ever again, i am too fucking broken and it is too fucking late for it, because i am a 27 year old loser who never really integrated properly in this shithole, never had a girlfriend, never had friends, only thing i have is a fucking job i hate and my parents that i also fucking hate because they do not understand any of this shit when i am talking to them about this. great so the only options left for me is to either suicide, or talk to a therapist, what a great way to be living life hey. i am legit not having a good time in this fucking life",2

"i always have had depression issue, ever since i can remember. i usually can cope, but recently i have just been alone all the time. all i have is my thoughts, and no one seems to care. my husband is never around, and usually chooses to hang out with friends then to be home with me and our dog. i do not have friends i can lean on, and my family is going through a lot and i cannot burden them. i just hate this feeling of loneliness 24 7, the emptiness it gives. i usually can play with my pup and feel better, but he recently had surgery and is a lot of work. i wish i could take a break, but no one else is there to help. when people do come around, usually my husbands friends family, they make it pretty obvious that they are there for him and do not care if i am there. if hes gone, they will not even wait for him. they usually leave until hes back, because god forbid someone has to be around me for more than 2 minutes. i am tired of being alone. i am tired of feeling empty and depressed. i am tired of constantly feeling like i am not enough, even for my husband. i hate being alone 24 7",2
i have a cold buee,3
i have set my deadline. it feels like such a relief to know ill be gone by then. the thought of it makes me happy. i will finally be free from this hell i have been living in.i have had a really bad week. my only friend who i have romantic feelings towards but am too much of a scared loser to tell her has been ignoring me and i feel i have hit a new low. she is the only person that makes me happy and the every time i spend time with her i actually feel happy to be alive. but then as she leaves its right back to reality. i have been cutting so much recently and its draining all of my energy. i cannot focus on anything i used to enjoy and am struggling to get any work done. i have a few family events i am going to that will be a final goodbye of sorts and then it will be time. i cannot wait. the years of self harm and suicidal thoughts will finally climax and end how they should. i have never told anyone about any of this so thanks for reading lt 3 my plans are made,6

"i have been struggling with anxiety and depression for 4 years now. i have lost loved ones and friends have drifted. i have never felt more alone. the only reason i have not committed suicide is because i know that my parents will not cope. my dad is an alcoholic and my mum is dependent on me. they do not support me or try to help me and if anything bring me down when i am low. they tell me i am a disappointment and they are ashamed. medication and talking does not help and i feel like there is nothing left that could fix me. but the guilt of what i want to do is killing me, but so is life. i am lost. guilt",6
since i wa a child i ve battled depression my first suicide attempt wa when i wa because according to my religion you re not liable for your sin until you reach maturity or puberty so i figured i m and miserable so if i end it all now i won t have to go to hell drank a bottle of tylenol and ended up in a hospital getting my stomach pumped and swallowing charcoal in college i met the love of my life we understood each other on a level nobody would understand we both had issue hers wa that she wa molested by her father we were both fucked up and our relationship turned very very toxic we d break up and get back together all the time and her family never liked me because i wa a year younger than her they wanted someone ready to take her in and provide her with everything the last time we broke up after year of being together she swallowed a bunch of pill and stopped breathing she turned blue ambulance wa called they resuscitated her but she stayed in a coma doctor tried to get the family to pull the plug because they said she s brain dead and even if she did wake up she wouldn t be the same i stayed by her side the whole time or a much a her family would let me she stayed plugged in and month later she woke up couldn t speak or feed herself or do anything she wa like a newborn baby she went through therapy but couldn t get all her function back she s still in a wheelchair her body shake uncontrollably so she can t feed herself seeing her like this broke me down in piece i couldn t see her like this and one day i left and never looked back i still feel a lot of blame for this i tried to have other relationship but they never work i m 0 now and live with my younger brother not talking to my other two brother or my father don t really have much to live for i have a problem with opioid prescription pill the only way i get any type of relief but it s an expensive habit since i only use prescription pill my mother who wa never really there for me or my brother growing up she wa always dating other men because she couldn t stand my father ha recently broke up with her latest husband and came to live with me and my younger brother she s a drama queen who s always miserable and make me and everyone else around miserable with her i have a decent career with decent money but no goal really i recently bought a few gram of heroin since i figured it would probably be the best way to go dying high a fuck in pure bliss i m just shit scared of being resuscitated and ending up in a wheelchair like my ex or being reincarnated into someone living in a third world country or even hell i made my mom promise not to resuscitate me if anything were to happen to me i m just not happy i have nothing to look forward to in my future i m thinking maybe i ll just take on the heroin habit without the intention to die and hope i accidentally od some day i mean it happens like every 0 second in my country i tried antidepressant and they work to help my mood sometimes but if you really have nothing to live for there s no cure for that i also just lost my job so perfect timing for that i don t even have the desire to look for another one i wish i could just sleep and not wake up,2
"why is it that i bend over backwards, but i never get the same courtesy? it always seems like i work super hard to make sure that everyone gets included in, but then i don't get it in return. i already think i'm getting closer to my time of month, so that's not helping my mood. but it always seems like the people i call friends in my life never seem to give me the same inclusion when i really need it.",2
"the grand old duke of hypochondria, he had 10,000 symptoms, and when he was only half way dead he was suddenly fine again! ever feel like every day is an uphill struggle? you re master and commander of a rebellious army of terrible thoughts that you spend all day corralling into a manageable format only for them to break ranks out of the blue and leave you exhausted and all out of battle plans? you would concede, surrender, wave your white flag, if you could. but when you re fighting yourself, there s no one to give in to, only a brief respite of broken sleep, spinning the roulette wheel of anxiety, will you wake up tomorrow with a new symptom or be granted a brief moment of peace? you pray for the latter and prepare for the former. monday you wake up with nausea, the stomach cancer is back again. but, you also had abnormally painful cramps on your last period, so the logical explanation is that these symptoms are linked. the ovarian cancer from november is back and spreading, you were bloated last friday too, if all makes sense when you put the pieces together. pace the floor a little as you wait for the toaster to pop. will i make a coffee? hmm, the caffeine won t help the nausea. just stick to water and down your multivitamins, your antidepressants, the liquid iron for the self diagnosed anaemia. palms are sweating, hands are jittery, a headache is setting in. oh god, is this the blood pressure dropping or hypoglycaemia setting in? only i could contract diabetes 15 minutes after learning of my terminal cancer diagnoses. the toaster pops, makes me jump a mile, heart racing. better check my pulse... great, a heart attack induced from the stress of my diabetes and cancer double blow. dr google is ready to see you now. nausea abdominal pain search what is this, amateur hour? i ve been coming to this doctor for 15 years, i know better than to be so vague with my symptoms. better be more specific. nausea, shakiness, headache, sweating, dry mouth.... no, no no. i ll just be told it s anxiety again. far better to type in what i know it is and confirm my hunch with the list of symptoms that comes up. for the 300th time in a decade you search for heart failure, kidney infection, four different types of cancer, parkinson s, m.s, stomach ulcers, all the time internally scanning your body meticulously for developing symptoms... you re so good at this now that you can feel the tiniest disturbance in your body, a twinge in your arm, the blurry vision when you look at a particular angle in a certain direction, is that a post nasal drip coming on? and the day speeds on, leaving you in the dust, an exhausted heap of worry and fear. the hours pass, commitments left to the wayside as you forge on in the pursuit of truth about your terminal condition. you re grumpy, snappy, why are people trying to talk to you when you are clearly on the cusp of finding out without doubt you have 6 days left to live? typing away on your phone or laptop, a partner or a parent curiously asking what you are up to are you on facebook, honey? you are short with them, you re busy. weighing up whether to tell them the truth, you re dying again, knowing you will be met with rolling eyes or a speech about how you re fine, to stop worrying. so instead you keep quiet, they think you re in another mood, you re always so moody. the night draws in and you re done. you ve scoured the forums, the articles, the youtube videos. you still feel like crap, noticing you ve a sore throat and swollen glands. great, hiv too. until, just before bed you do what you always do. find the others like you, wrap yourself in the thin fraying blanket of comfort that comes when you accept there are others all over the world who are dying today, who receive new terminal diagnoses every other week, those poor souls who receive crushing news of an incurable illness like most people receive spam email. health anxiety. a seemingly uninstallable app rooted in your brain with new and exciting updates every day. your foe, your enemy, your captor. tuesday and wednesday go off without a hitch, you have no symptoms, you re healthy for a couple days. wednesday you caught norovirus from that person on the bus. thursday it was gone but you woke up with leukemia, how you managed to trudge into work after that blow was a miracle. friday you were cured, saturday the pinnacle of health, sunday the cancer was back. and so the cycle continues. held captor to a cruel brain one with a tumour in it that is so over sensitive to every bodily function, every twinge, that in its effort to inform your of your terrible illness, it s slowly killing your soul day after day. there s hope for us yet. once i went a whole month without silently battling a terrible incurable disease. one day that will be a couple months, then a year, and i ll live like all the normal healthy people all around me. one day.",0
"recently i 15m have been getting little-to-no sleep and it is because one minute i am happy, the next i am thinking about random things then i just become sad.i always think about this one girl who i have liked for years who i have not talked to yet and i am probably never going to because i do not want to be a screenshot in the group chat - i just want to tell her how i feel but it will just feel wrong because we do not talk - but she is exactly my type, we do similar gcse's we both do art and i just cannot stop having feelings about her and i am in pain because of it. i am also highly self-conscious as i am big, fat and ugly, therefore hate myself however i have recently been trying to work out with little success.at school i act fine, and make friends laugh yet i am in pain, i need to talk to someone and i have been giving hints to one of my friends yet i am not sure he quite gets what i am hinting at. it is just good because school takes my mind off of some things but it also creates more stress through homework and exams.i also think about how i barely see my dad and when i do i just here spiteful comments yet i got to love him, he is my dad after all. this really takes a toll on me because i wish i could have a stronger connection with my dad and makes me think about how lucky some people are for having their parents together.i always think about ending it all but then that thought gets me emotional because i do not want my sister or mum to go through the pain of me being gone because i love them both with all my heart. i am only 15 and i do not want to be alive, but i do not want to be dead either. i wish i grew up in another generation, my generation is fucked and all this technology messes with us. why cannot i go to my dad's times that he always talks about - playing out all day with friends, having fun.i hate my life but i do not hate living. sleepless nights",2

over the last year my life ha completely fallen apart i grew up happy a ever with a very well off family a brother i got along with friend i hung out with all the time then my baby sister died out of nowhere shortly after my parent said they were getting a divorce after having a loving caring family my entire life in the span of just a month everything flipped upside down i don t have a family outside of my mother and baby brother anymore and my mother ha robbed the house of peace by becoming fixated on an emotionally abusive boyfriend my entire life wa destroyed and it s only gotten worse year into the divorce my best friend died all of my other friend and friend group i wa in slowly just forgot about me due to depression and anxiety from everything i had going on making me become incredibly introverted and just not fun to be around anymore he wa the only person i had that i could talk to besides my girlfriend who i put through hell because of how much i hated myself and my situation and now he wa gone shortly after his death her and i broke up and i deserved it i wasn t abusive but i wasn t a good boyfriend i never wanted to go anywhere or do anything i stopped wanting sex and intimacy because i didn t think i deserved those thing the divorce ha only gotten worse over the year and after year of stress and anxiety being a constant my health ha now started to decline i ve lost my toned body i ve lost my nice smile i ve lost my sense of fashion i ve given up entirely on trying to form new relationship or make new friend because i know that i just don t have what it take to foster deep relationship anymore i ve seen a therapist about this and she said she belief it s because of my family and my best friend and that now my brain correlate love with loss which prevents me from getting attached to people or make me act in way to push others away before they can get attached to me with my health issue getting worse due to the constant stress i m now out of work on medical leave i sit in my room every day just watching youtube not talking to a single soul and no one talking to me i truly believe that my life ha reached a point where it just isn t worth living anymore besides my mother and baby brother i don t believe there is a single person that would even notice especially if i made it look like an accident with all the free time i now have i ve been reading a lot about spirituality and i ve stumbled across the plausibility of reincarnation the idea of death being the entry to a new life with life being a series of goal to fulfill a purpose from each life to the next it s been very difficult for me to try and think of any purpose my life ha at this point i m debilitatingly lonely i ve stopped caring about anything i ve become very cynical and i m letting thing that should be important to a person just waste away like just ceasing to pay my car bill because i no longer care if it get repossessed the idea of even the possibility of being able to start again since truly no one ha any idea what happens when you die is more appealing to me than continuing to live i m now and my life is going absolutely nowhere and i don t know what else to do i have no support system i have no one but myself and i hate myself more than anyone else the worst kind of lonely is when you aren t even there for yourself and that s where i m at now i ve always thought of myself a a great person i consistently go out of my way to help others even now if someone reach out to me for something i don t hesitate but i just can t get anyone to stick around not even my own father give a shit about me anymore i used to think the world wa just fucked up and bad thing happen to good people but it s becoming more and more evident a i witness the relationship other people have the family other people have the friend other people have that that theory just doesn t add up the more likely possibility is that i myself am the issue i m the problem and i ve come to that realization now the idea that death might not be the end but a new beginning is very appealing to me like to think ha anyone else thought about these concept ha anyone else found themselves in a similar situation and thought about what come after death and whether it s worth it just curious and looking for some input thank you,2
"scared to start meds hey all. i ve been in therapy since age 6, baker acted at 15, sent to inpatient treatment at age 17, stayed for a year for self harm, depression, and substance abuse. in inpatient they just said i needed to find god and quit smoking pot and life would be dandy. then, the inpatient program took me off my depression and adhd meds because i traded adderall for a cigarette. life was miserable. so, i went straight to university after inpatient treatment genius move and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. i think that the diagnosis is fitting but i don t trust it completely what if it s bpd or cyclothymia? fast forward a year, i dropped my therapist. school is tough because i m either so hyped up i think that i don t need school because i m a genius and a god among men and can do anything i want with my life. other times, i ll miss a week of classes and do no work because i hate myself and want to die. all in all, i m so used to dealing with the symptoms that i don t want to take meds or go back to therapy because i m scared of the side effects. i don t want to lose my sex drive or get fat or be lazy. i don t want to give up drugs and alcohol. and i m really distrustful of doctors because not a one has helped me in the past. tl dr i m fucked up, probably bipolar, barely passing my classes, but don t want to experience side effects from meds. what do i do",1

"my whole life i have always been vocal, i do not put up with things. i do me. but fast forward and i am currently 27, ill be 28 in a couple weeks. if i stay in the military another day past my separation date i swear ill probably blow my head off, even though i have felt like doing it for years. before you ask, yes, i have talked to someone what a waste of time. i am planning to separate early next year. i am tired of doing. i am tired of thinking. i am tired of giving. i give, give, and give. i have no more to give. i am tired of helping everyone, i am tired of talking, i am tired of taking care of things. i am tired of not being heard. i am tired of talking to only be seen as every word that comes out of my mouth as insignificant or because others prioritize their wants and cannot handle the mere idea of listening, respecting, or considering my desires and instead treat every word out of my mouth as argumentative. my kid is now one, even when i talk about things about him that id like, i am told to just put my wants aside and let do this, and told to even apologize for things i say with a calm demeanor that i feel adamant about. no one cares about anything that i think, how i feel, what my responsibilities are, or what i contribute when all i do is support my wife, my son, my family, those close to me, and those at work. i am tired of being treated like i am less than, i am tired of working for others in this fucked up 9-5 system that we all live by, i am tired of being asked to do things in my personal life when i do not want to do to them. i am tired. i just want to be put to rest like all those 100 terrorists i helped bury, i am just so damn tired. women want men to cater to them. i want to be catered to. treat a woman how you treat your mom? why cannot they treat us the same? i want to receive affection, i want to know that i matter and that all i do have done matters. i am exhausted of being exhausted. i am tired. iam tired. i am tired. tired is who i am. i am done and i do not care anymore. i am okay now to be silent, i do not care about what i want anymore. i am done. i am tired",2
i can t cope with being alone again why am i so envious of my closest friend being happy with others while i am here by myself heartbroken and given delusion that i have an actual special relationship with her you told me that i wa your closest friend but why don t you treat me like one why do you look happier when you re with others why do you always make me look like a fool when i show my affection but appreciate any other person when they show theirs i ve always helped you at you at your lowest but why did you give up on me at my lowest there s so much that i want to ask her but i would look pathetic if i do you always tell me in person that i am important to you but why don t you want to spend time with me like the way we used to how can i get used to being alone again it s like i m being choked then allowed to breathe for a second just to get choked again right after my envy won t let me go i still want her i am still hoping i could fix this i want to be happy too but now nobody care if i show sadness i ll be seen a weak why do others get loved and have dependable people with them while i am left alone trying to find answer from people that are lonely too may i ask how can i depend on solely myself again i need to learn how i opened myself too much and now i feel like a husk with everything taken out from me i would not commit suicide but i have no fear of death now if it mean taking away these thought away from me once and for all,2

"i am sick and tired of just about everything. i hate my job and spend 40 hours a week doing useless shit that i do not give a fuck about and that helps no one. i look to apply for other jobs and see more of the same boring mundane bullshit. i set aside the money that i earn from work to put towards some stupid ""dream"" or ""goal"" that i am supposed to have, but i have no fucking clue what it is.all the paths that i am expected to take are a load of bullshit. i have no intrest in starting some ""career"" that will not mean jack shit once i am dead. i do not care about having kids or starting a family, why would i want to drag them into existence? to try and navigate the shithole society that is only going to get worse? if they took after me, they would probably not want to exist either, with the way the world is. i honestly think i do not even care about relationships anymore either. i do not ""hate"" people per se, but nowadays i find most people to be such a bore to be around, and only have a small group of friends and family who i find tolerable. i would never want to just settle for whoever came along at the right time, it would be unfair on them for me to not be entirely committed, so i do not understand the point of holding out for my perfect match who does not even exist, thinking that one day they will suddenly come along.i just do not know what to do. i used to think things like ""i wish i could just disappear"", but now i want to exist to experience the amazing things that i am sure are out there, but i do not know what they are. it ends up being a more frustrating concept than wanting to vanish, because you are wanting to exist for something that you are not even sure of, and it creates layers of complex and contradicting thoughts and feelings.i just want to stop following this shitty road laid out by society towards a ""successful"" life of pointless bullshit and take the scenic route, but i do not feel like i know what that scenic route even is, or how to get there. i want to live a life i know i have thoroughly enjoyed, and ideally to have left something worthwhile behind once it is over.i want a reason to wake up in the morning. i do not want to feel like i am wasting my time anymore. tired of the whole thing. do not even know what to do anymore.",2

"tw mentions of sexual assault amp this year in february i was sexually assaulted on a school field trip. it was from a guy who was in one of the other classes but he was still in my grade. he picked me up and put his hands in places that made me very uncomfortable. i yelled at the guy to stop and he did but it still made me uncomfortable.a few months later i decided to come forward and talk to a teacher from my school about it in hope that she would help or at least do something. one of my close friends came with me to talk to the teacher as i did not feel strong enough to talk to her alone. my friend and i talked to the teacher, let us call her mrs. x, and at first, mrs. x seemed understanding and supportive. later that day mrs. x pulled me and my friend out of class to write down a few things to back up my allegations. i made a witnesses list as other people had witnessed my being assaulted. this was followed by my witnesses being interviewed and giving details.on my final period on a friday, i was pulled out of my class and mrs. x pulled me into an empty classroom and sat me down. for the next hour, she ran me through about how i was lying and that one of the witnesses had told her that i was lying and just did not like the guy who assaulted me and i was doing it all for a laugh. as anyone would, i sat in that classroom and cried. mrs. x believed one witness and not the victim. then came the scariest thing i had heard, ""you will likely be charged with false reporting of sexual assault and will have a permanent criminal record"". now i am a good person i have never got a detention or anything but i would not say i am the teacher's pet but still, of all the things that i thought could have come from me coming forward this was not one of them. amp i spent the whole weekend in fear. i could not afford to have a criminal record. i had not even told my parents about it. i was so angry at my school for doing this to me. i know that i was sexually assaulted and i would never ever make things like that up. i was furious but also very scared of what would happen next. i heard nothing about the situation till the next tuesday, two weeks after i came forward. mrs. x pulled me out of class again and into her office. she told me that the guy's family did not want to give me a criminal record or charge me. then she looked me in the eye and said that i was a lair and that i was overreacting. amp overall, mrs. x still does not believe that i was assaulted. and i am thankful that the guy's parents were nice enough to not send my life into a downward spiral. i got in trouble for being sexually insulted",2
"hello, my girlfriend 21f has issues with depression, mild autism, a traumatic childhood, mild adhd, social anxiety, and alcoholism.i am requesting advice on how to be a good better boyfriend for her, specifically advice related to these issues. i have read some online articles but i would like to hear some personal experiences thoughts.she is usually high functioning but it sometimes seems like kind of a ""show"", and then she will get into a depressed state. she often wants to hide from me and the world and do some unhealthy escapism lots of alcohol and drugs .i love her and care about her, but honestly have no idea what to do. maybe this is a dumb question, but when she asks me to leave her alone... do i just leave her alone? we live together . it is hard for me to just walk away from her and leave her when she is hurting. feels like abandonment to me.we have talked about therapy and it is not something she is interested in doing at this time, due to bad experiences with prior therapy. request - advice for the boyfriend",2

imo r bipolar has become too mainstream how many people on r bipolar actually have that condition? seems like a good percentage of the posts on there are just people complaining about stuff everyone will go through at some point. seems like some are self diagnosed and are just trying to fit into the whole being bipolar is cool fad. it s not fun or cool when you hurt people are actually permanently damage your future and loose friends. i can get the humor appeal of that sub but i mean come on. this disease isn t something that should be taken lightly. even one of my coping mechanisms is humor but half the stuff in there is just dumb shit.,1

blood clot fear pushing on my thigh when i stand straight up all the way at the top about 2 inches from my hip bone causes some discomfort. i don't really know how to describe the pain other than almost tingly and a little sore. been paying attention to it for about 6 months but may have been there longer. it's on my left leg if that matters but really making me worry i may have a blood clot. that leads me to worry it might break off at any moment and pretty much end me. is there any other reason the constant discomfort would be here or do i likely have a clot?,0
"this is my story.my first memory is from 4 years old, when i woke up in an apartment, my mom had went outside and i panicked. i went outside the building in nightgown crying helplessly.other memory is about finding out what death means when i was 6 years old. i realized that a grandfather i never met was gone forever and that all people face that one day. i rolled myself in a mat having a panic attack and i was laughed at.then school started. i was taken sexually advantaged by my school mates.i tried to kill myself at 12.i was raped at 12 and again at 13.i was taken sexually and emotionally advantaged by an adult from 14-17 years of age.now i am 29. my 10 year lasting relationship is at it is end due to my emotional problems. i would be graduating and starting a dream job in fall. but i just cannot anymore. i have zero people to talk to, no friends. therapy can start in the end of september the earliest due to lack of resources. i cannot afford paying therapy and get there faster.i think i would be better to just stop being a burden to everyone around me. my mom told me i was not wanted. everyone is better without me and i cannot offer what my partner deserves. i do not want to be me",6

"today i went to a restaurant with my family while on vacation, and it was one i had not been to since my ex and i went when we were together over 3 years ago. i cried in the restaurant and could not stop. after he dumped me with no warning, i spent 6 months crying every single day and was suicidal. i had to go to therapy but i only had 2 sessions because i could not afford it. but i am mostly better with that, although i still have my days. i will return to therapy once i get a full time job again and can hopefully afford it.so yeah -- i just started crying in the restaurant because it overwhelmed me with memories same restaurant but different location . guess i am still not over him. i have not tried to date since, i am not even interested in meeting anyone. i always had mild depression but i feel that break up was so traumatic that it broke something inside of me. i felt a piece of myself die. has a traumatic event made you feel like that? did your depression get worse? idk the point in this or what i am asking for -- i just needed somewhere to write this and get it off my mind. thank you everyone. remember to love yourself first before anyone else had a set back today",2

"i am sure more people feel the same way i do. i am 24 almost 25 , and i have pretty much zero experience with women. never had a girlfriend. i had my first sexual experience this past year with this girl who came onto me full force at a dinner party my friend threw in a random evening. i did not even realize she was hitting on me until she kissed me out of nowhere. the next day i went to her house and we did some stuff, but i was so incredibly nervous that it was a complete disaster. i could not enjoy the moment whatsoever, and i feel very sad about it. i am not ashamed about the sexual experience itself being a disaster, nor about the fact that it happened so late in my life, or the lack of experience in general for all these years. i do not really care for that. what i really crave is affection. i just want to be loved, to hold hands, to kiss, hug and cuddle, and subsequently, the sex will have it is role, but i do not see it as the main focus. that day i spent with that girl, although i had my first sexual experience, it was the affection and attention part that filled my void. i did not see her again since then, if you are wondering.i have spent my teens without much of a care for this, and entering on my 20's as well. always been a loner, and on good terms with that. but now, the loneliness is starting to hit me hard, as i see my close friends in long term relationships for years with the same person, and some of them already having children, forming families, etc. i do not know man... i have been successful in my friendships, both with men and women, and i am very grateful for that. but in romantic relationships, it is the polar opposite. it is like a dark side of me that i do not want to think about, or want people to know. i am tired of being alone. i am not sexually frustrated, i am emotonally frustrated.",2

"over the past 4 months, i lost all my friends, partner and more. i am 16 and a couple of months ago i was falsely accused of something i did not do, i do not want to disclose what it was at this time, you can draw your own conclusions but of course, there was police involvement because of this. so i got pulled out of school for this and got arrested with my phone taken off me as a part of the undertaking and i could not go to school for a couple of weeks. during this time through the school, rumours were spread of all the things i had allegedly done. of course, everyone had heard a different story basically making me a terrible person in all their eyes. because of this, my friend group left me like litter in the street so i have no friends anymore and nobody will talk to me. and since i had my phone taken off me my partner drifted from me and as they put it ""lost feelings"" that they had previously had for me although i held on for them the entire time. we met up like 3 weeks back and i cried the entire time lol. we met by the water and once she left i walked up to my knees in water getting ready to drown myself but only stopping once i saw people approaching, they probs do not know it but i think they saved my life. before this, i cut both my wrists open in the bath and let the water into my blood. i did not die as you can tell by me writing this but i lost a lot of blood and was bedridden for so long.i have nobody to talk to and nothing to do. i am getting sent to counselling on the 28th and if they will accept me ill have to attend 12 sessions. i do not think i will be able to go through with it this times been so tough i can see that everyone around me like my parents are saddened by my presence and i feel like a burden with them all always worrying about me. everyone around me has always said they are scared for my wellbeing but now more than ever.i wrote about my life as a coping mechanism if this was not long enough here is my lifes story here idk what to do with my life.",6

"reading. too much of my time is occupied in mindlessness. getting engrossed in a good story is the perfect practice of mindfulness, and mindfulness is the key to everything. if you do not exercise your conscious cerebrum, your unconscious cerebellum takes over, and that part of your brain does not want you happy. it wants you scared, anxious, discontent and twisted up with longing and regret, because that is how it motivates the actions that keep you alive. it evolved long before complex emotion, and it does not give a damn about your heartache. your heavy concerns are legitimate, but you are under no obligation to match your mood to your circumstances. how strange that we think we have no say in that! you are entitled to take charge of how you feel and who you are. if reading is not your thing, and you cannot see your way to changing that, find something else that pleasantly engages your full attention, and do it every day. its not a magic pill, but it is a key to effortlessly tapping into the power you already possess. i have connected every single episode of depression and sadness i experience to the neglect of one single habit.",2

"decreased need for sleep, difficulty taking meds i m not sure where the best place to ask this is. i m too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so i m hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything. i m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated. the last maybe month or so ? i guess i ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations i m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don t want to make it seem like i don t care about my mental health. i am experiencing all symptoms of hypo? mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis. it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don t need to. i m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania. any advice or support would be helpful. thank you all who read",1

"i ask you from the bottom of my heart to help me....... p.s the whole essence of the problem is in the second paragraph, the first paragraph is about me i am 18 years old, i have a weak nervous system from birth, but a strong character, and because of three years of serious problems in life, the death of several close people, my nervous system has failed and i probably have chronic anxiety. from below i will describe everything that i have tried, if you have something to say, i beg on my knees, help me i tried meditation for 40 minutes a day, breathing techniques and much more of this type - but i came to the conclusion that this is not a solution to the problem, but a group control of my mind i have tried a very large number of different herbs, ashwagandha, sacred basil.also, different supplements - taking longer than 1 month and zero results, at most it became a little easier, but it is almost imperceptible.personally, i think that these herbs, supplements are mostly utter nonsense, which has a lot of side effects, stupid studies that were not conducted in real life or just made to promote the product i tried using reishi mushroom, cbd oil from a proven brand, tried vaping and other ways of using and everything is even please do not recommend medications or any herbs of the ""kava"" type, which has a hundred side effects, it is better to die than to eat this shit.if you really know a ""magic supplement, herb or something else"" about which few people know and it helped you or your friend, acquaintance - tell it to me please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please do not think that i am the type of people who have tried 1 product and immediately gave up, i am a person who always goes to the end and will never accept defeat.i really spent a hundred hours analyzing this topic for the most part, and 99 of all the information is just a stinky slag bitch and it's impossible to fucking find adequate information.i searched in youtube in different languages, also in google itself for different queries in different languages, on twitter and facebook and found nothing working.if you have read this mini-post, thank you so much for at least thinking about the possible help to a stranger.all the best to you!!!!!!!",5

"coming off seroquel okay so around this time last year i went on seroquel ir due to unable to sleep and depressive symptoms. that shit rocked me and i couldn t handle being a zombie 16 hours a day. so i switched to xr a couple months later. well jump to now i want to come off it. one i think the depressive symptoms are mainly gone. i just can t handle the side effects any more. the constant hunger that can t be ignored, so hard to wake up at in the am ect. i know this is bad but i stopped taking it for a few days because of hypomanic episode and it wasn t the episode but not being on it that made me feel so much fucking better. like i could breathe. i m still on lamotrigine and want to go up more since my mood has been a little whacky so i m obviously not on nothing. but have people gone off seroquel after a bad depressive episode and was your psych on board or did they make you switch meds? did you just fall back into a depression? please just let me know any of your stories. thanks all",1

why is avpd considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? so from what i have read seems like avpd is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of avpd seems like no one likes to have this condition. so why isn't avpd considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with avpd seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem? like the symptoms are basically the same in a lot of ways.,4

"hello, i am new to this sub. mental health is not really a big thing in our country and due to the pandemic, i am not really able to get help. i have been trying to understand whether this feeling i have is normal or is it like people say depression is because my understanding of depression is not so good. lately, i have been feeling nothing. i am not sad, i am not suicidal but at the same time, i do not look forward to anything. i feel like if i could explain it in a diagram, its kind of like my heart and mind feels empty instead of how kids usually draw the heart colored with red. its just plain emptiness. sometimes this emptiness makes me feel like i am tired to do anything. i do not want to do anything. all i want to do is be in my bed. play with my phone and do nothing. because of how i feel like nothing, i do nothing. i also do not feel sad. does anyone know how i can overcome this empty feeling? is it normal to not feel anything at all?",2
"my therapist says it is depression so this is why i am here. i am not sure what to do. i do basically nothing every day. i cannot go outside since my parents will not take me too often. i am 16, but i am not allowed to go alone. not for five minutes. i know my parents want the best for me. i still wish we could go outside more than once a month.my family fights every day. it has always been this way. the yelling sounds like they are killing each other. thankfully, there has never been any physical violence of any kind. but still.i write songs. that is the only thing i can do. i sometimes shower. it is extremely difficult to do so. i keep thinking of all these people who actually shower, brush their teeth, brush their hair, change into clean clothes every day and still have energy for other things. right now, i feel like i will never be able to do things like these. it sounds like way, way too much and yet it is normal to everyone.i do not feel like trying to get better. it is so far away, i cannot even picture a life where i can do basic human things. i cannot. i do not think i ever will.i have had maybe five friends my whole life and none of them at the same time. i am not just shy, i straight up cannot speak to most people. not even my own dad. i have always been like this. i know my parents want me to try harder and just talk like a normal person. i keep trying and it keeps not happening. i really wish i had a friend, but then i know it would be scary.i have always felt something is deeply wrong with me. i have never felt truly ""heard"" by anyone. ever. i know it sounds dramatic. it is true. i think i am human too. how ""weird"" can i get? everything i have ever accomplished has been against my own will. as for the things i actually want to do, they have never felt more impossible than today. sometimes i listen to this one song and the lyrics say ""i cannot seem to shake it yet, feeling that things may never change"". it makes me cry because every time i hear it i realize time has passed and things have indeed not changed.this was long. i am so sorry for my rambling. thanks for letting me be myself. they say it gets better, does it? i do not think i am living",2

"want to resign from my job hey all, i m really struggling at the moment and all i can think about is resigning from my role. i m a social worker who provides therapy to children adolescents with complex mental health difficulties. i ve been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago i changed my workplace location to be closer to home. it s the same service just a different location. oh .. and i m acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. i thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident, however, i m still feeling like an imposter, scared and worried about criticism. extremely terrified of social interactions too. just knowing i have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. i m also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but i still dread the work that i have to do. all i keep thinking about is waking up in the morning, switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach, pretending i have no responsibilities or cares in the world. i know that s not possible though. if i did resign i would make sure never to find a therapy role again as it s not something i m too keen on and social interactions terrify me. should i keep trying to work in spite of the anxiety i experience? i think i ve given it a fair shot and i can t take it anymore! any advice would be greatly appreciated.. thanks!",4

"concussion anxiety taking over my life let me just preface this by saying i've been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life, even to the point of freaking out over a bat maybe biting me after it flew over my head once. i've never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening tbi is my hugest fear and it's basically consumed me. almost two full days ago, i slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls. not ruthlessly hard, but just hard enough to worry. i matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasn't stopped me from flipping out excessively. since i woke up yesterday though, i've gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so i couldn't function in my normal life without freaking out, which has worried me. while i didn't get a headache, i had minor, non-painful, yet strange feeling head pressure, especially when moving it, slight sensitivity to light, occasionally feeling dazed, me not being able to remember or place words in sentences, etc. it became rough trying to figure out which 'symptoms' were from me freaking myself out, and which could be potentially real. i even stopped drinking coffee because i'm so freaked out caffeine could make my 'concussion' worse. the worst part came last night, when i dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8. i couldn't sleep. i kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything, heart racing, and it got to the point i kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where i'd wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety i've had in my life. so, reasonably, i googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas, which freaked me out even more, because now i'm convinced i have a brain bleed. i woke up this morning and i still feel dazed, still shaking, even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world. even after friends who've had real concussions reassured me, nothing's helped, in fact me googling shit made it worse like always. i guess my rant results to me asking whether or not i'm justified being like this. i've been honest to god debating on just driving to an er or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact i'm only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind. the anxiety has been consuming me, and i'm 100 convinced i'm dying, and it's the worst.",0

"i am not sure if anyone here has felt this way, but i feel a sort of existential depression that is not a result of lacking or wanting things. on the surface, i feel like i have everything that anyone could ever want. i am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.however, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since i was a young teenager. even in grade school, i exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. my family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and i cannot ever thank them enough for that. nonetheless, i still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.what i feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. no matter how i weigh the quantifiable joy i have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. i perhaps feel so terrible that i feel nothing at all.on a primal level, i possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. i hate being human. i do not want to be me anymore. why do i have to be me? the sheer pain i feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that i can extract from life. even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, i would feel nothing but the phantom pain. i am bound to this worthless body and by the obligations i have towards the people in my life, and i cannot even fathom them ever understanding my plight. no one will. i am trapped. an outlet for my personal feelings.",2
"when i mentioned to my friend that i just wished i was pair of floating eyeballs in this world with no body, just observing everything, she said you already told me that once before. the feeling of perceived is an especially horrifying thought for me for some reason, even more so now that i am 24. i do not know what brought over this sudden phobia but many times i caught myself thinking i wish i could disappear forever. maybe its the idea of having to exist more than a viewer is what is upsetting to me. maybe i do not want to participate in life anymore. do all the things i have to do when i am supposed to. i thought about running away. but what am i running away from? to where? should i do it now? what about my job? does anything even matter?i started taking antidepressants yesterday and everything stated above may be a result of that but maybe not. i just wish i could understand what i am feeling honestly. but i really do not. i am feeling numb about people that i care about. i have no interest in living any longer. i really do not care for the future. i am showing no interest in dating, having and raising a family, hobbies, just enjoying my life in general. my life is mostly empty but i am not trying to fill it, it seems. there is nothing i want to fantasize about. this is something i would have to live with. i feel like no matter what happens, i will be sad for the rest of my life. and nothing will change that. i wish i could put more effort into me but its hard to find a reason to. i am aware its starting to affect my relationships with friends and family but my apathy is greater. i want to be unapologetically me. wear what i want, do what i want without any fear. and i find myself wishing that was me when i see others living out their best lives. i wish i could do little things day to day but i am so overwhelmed and i am impatient because i want results like yesterday but that is not possible so nothing changes. just stuck",2

"i don't want to see her either! i lost touch with an acquaintance-. well, she chose not wanting to see me because she sort of blames her mental health on me, which i did not cause. i literally did nothing to this woman. she was into literature and writing and i encouraged her writing a little and we both knew about each other's anxiety. we didn't talk about our problems though. she shared she had social anxiety. she knew i had generalized anxiety, but that has improved greatly for me now. that was the extend of us knowing about each other's problems. she decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true. she doesn't even know me well enough to determine what kind of person i am so that is part of what upset me. the other part is just the way she went about the situation. i have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her. the trust wouldn't be there and i'd always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again. see, it shouldn't hurt so much just from a little ol' acquaintance but it did hurt so much. when you live so close to each other and end up in the same public spaces at times, it is awkward and somehow, i feel like i am in the wrong for being there when i have every right to be in public spaces.",4

"i feel the world is very bleak and my personal future seems bleak even though i live ""comfortably"" with every convenience within my reach and in a first world country etc. i would not call this depression as i feel extremely lucid and clear thinking despite experiencing lethargy regularly i believe this is due to working nights rather than my mental state . i want to prosper but also kind of do not really see the point at the same time. it all feels pointless and wasteful continuing my life of mostly just meaningless consumerism. the internet reminds me how bleak the world is regularly. i guess i do have too much screen time. i am pursuing self-improvement and long term goals but at the same time, regularly think about throwing myself off a particular cliff that i know of in my country my ideal spot . i picture this regularly. some terrible things have happened are happening to me lately including - my 2 closest relatives getting seriously ill likely cancer, one recurring cancer and one cancer in an organ which has been weakened over time from other serious illness - someone died in front of me at work while i was holding his hand and talking to him - my partner's mother died - my old family dog is dying - i was bullied at my job - i hate my job - i have no clear alternative to my current job - i am not happy with my appearance i have been pursuing plastic surgery but also think this is pointless and a waste of money, materials and resources amp sorry for the ramble. i will probably delete this but i am curious about what a reaction would be like. have had regular suicidal thoughts for around two years and they are increasing in regularity",6

"let me preface this by saying that this is mostly me venting and thinking that i am an attention seeker.i do not know how often it happens but its gotten to the point that i am writing this. i do not know if this is normal not but i am turning 20 in a couple of days and for the past 5-6 years have had on and off bouts of suicidal thoughts. some worse than others where i seriously plan out and try and figure out the way to commit suicide in a way that would not end up making my parents sad. i do not want to give myself a self-diagnosis so i do not consider myself depressed, just really stupid.pretty much every night i have existential thoughts about wishing i was never born or wishing my parents and friends hated me so they would not care if i killed myself. i hate writing stuff down or trying to explain myself because of two reasons. first is i think i am an attention seeker meaning i think that i am not actually depressed. i mean in all honesty i should not be. nothing bad has ever happened to me so i should not be depressed i do not understand why. i hate talking about this because i hate people who self-diagnose and try and get attention and pity from others. the only reason i am posting this is because i am concerned about my mental health because i actually visited a nearby bridge at around 4 am, but gave up because i was scared of my parents being sad. this is my second time writing this.my second reason is my parents. i honestly wish they never had me. they care about me, and i am basically just spitting in their face by having these thoughts. i wish they hated me so i would not care about waiting to kill myself.i would like to know how to bring this up to people if i actually am suicidal. currently i am hating myself to the extreme because i quit my first job after 3 years and have been leeching off my parents for the last month except for doing chores, and running errands for them. they even give me money for the errands and i do not even pay rent so i feel like a complete scumbag. i am interviewing for a job soon though.i pretty much dropped out of college because i could not even find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and that led me to being scared to go to classes because i am so behind.recently i have not found any joy out my hobbies either i just feel empty doing them so i just decided to stop doing them altogether. my interests, and motivation to do anything has just skyrocketed downwards recently so that is fun.sorry for the incoherent rambling, last question is is this normal to think this way, am i depressed, or am i an attention seeker. i would like to know how to bring this up to people if i am actually suicidal. am i actually depressed?",6

"we are 21 now, both turning 22 next month. it started off as friendly catching up, but things have gotten more romantic and we have been hanging out a lot more. i wasn t sure we could ever be together again, but i no longer have feelings of sadness or resentment regarding what he did to me. i have noticed by the way he carries himself now, he has definitely matured. i guess i just want to know when or if i should tell him i hooked up with his friends?",3

"i am an early teenager and i should be enjoying my life and doing fun things but i am not. i just sit at home and watch anime or play games on the tv. i know i still have time to fix my life but i am not motivated and i constantly feel like my whole life is pointless. no matter how much i try to get out and do things i end up feeling like shit. i am not even sure my friends care about me anymore i have just stopped talking to mostly everyone. i have like one ""friend"" who is going through what i am going through but we rarely talk and i have these other ""freinds"" who are just dry as hell but at least they like living. my parents do not seem to understand and will take me to like see friends or whatever but i do not even like these people. they are just old friends that are dry and ig i am like their only friend but i honestly do not care about them. everything i do feels forced and if its not its not even fun in fact nothings fun i am kindof just waiting for me to magically feel motivated. i am going to have to go back to school soon and i do not even care about school anymore. sometimes i feel like ending it all because i do not even do anything or have an impact on anyone i am basically just a rock. i do not really know what i am asking for but if anyone knows anything tell me i guess if you care. i do not even know what the point of this is but i will post.",2
"i have this dumb habit of overflowing jealosy whenever i listen to music, watch movies or internet videos, read articles. i am jealous of succesful people and often imagine myself in their shoes, situations which will never happen and once i am back to reality it is sadness, anger. no, i am not talented, i am lazy uneducated and antisocial scum so there is no chance i would ever be like thst. i think i do not want to get better and do not want to live at all because i will never reach life which would satisfy me. i can get better and life grey and boring life but i feel like that would just put me back in the depressed shoes. so i kind of gave up on living because there is no living for me to have in the first place. still sucks to look at other people's smiles while holding tears myself. i think i am like that because i cannot accept living as basic boring person",6

"19 f why is that i am always forgotten or ignored? i am really giving my best to be the best friend to my one and only friend. i comfort them whenever they want to talk about their problems, help them to solve these problems or anything. i already told her last autumn when i really just had enough that i understand she has a life. but why is she always ignoring my messages and only seeing them when we meet at school and i ask them ""what is wrong, why did not you responded to my messages yesterday?"". and no, i am not bombing her with messages. only the normal conversation between friends ""you want to go anywhere tomorrow after school?"", ""have you read that-"", ""i cannot do this hw, help me please?"", sending memes, etc - just on the minimal, like 1 message 2 days. she knows god damn well that i have no one else to talk to. it is hard for me to bottle up everything again when i thought i finally got a friend who can listen to me. it is so damn suffocating because i cannot do anything. even now. i am working overboard for 2 months now. not a single ""wassup"", ""so how is it going"" or anything. nothing. and i see her being online all the time because she is not working. and before someone says it why am i not writing her first well, i was always the one to do that. i may be stupid and stubborn right now but i do not really care. let it be a test if i should continue this or no. the shittiest is that i do not even feel sad about it because this situation is not new for me. to be alone and just living through every day. but it is hard when you get here again after experiencing everything that a friendship can offer you. i feel hopeless and kind of empty.i just really want someone to listen to me. just once. is it really that much to ask for? i am confused",2
"how do i get over my stress and anxiety related to having to learn to drive? i live down south in a mountainous hilly area and i find it stressing even as a passenger at times because of how winding and narrow the roads are. it's as if a normal street was cut in half. there is consistently a large amount of brush around these roads which can obscure my vision. there are also a lot of guard rails around these roads which adds to it. i am being pressured by my family to learn to drive, mainly because 10 years ago my mom got high on prescription pills as she often does and went out at 3 in the morning driving somewhere and critically injured herself, almost paralyzing herself in the process i was told that my mother is in the .1 of people who have a full complete recovery from the type of spinal damage she incurred in her accident without any loss of mobility . i also take prescription medication, and she has begun threatening to not pick up my prescriptions anymore if i don't do this which has also added to my stress. my family tells me that i can do all sorts of fun activities outside if i have a car which i have little to no interest in, the only reason i leave my house is for food shopping and doctor's appointments . i obviously do not live somewhere there is easily accessible public transportation, either. for the most part i'm scared of injuring myself or another person if i'm behind the wheel.",5

"years of living on survival mode? its been tough on you, no one shares your feelings or feel your pain, you are all alone, and the world is only pushing you to the edge every single day, you are tired, just want to sleep to forget, to get out of the reality that surrounds you, no matter how many times you try to take your mind off of your trauma, your agony or your numbness. the poisonous what if hunts you every moment, the why and the why me. waking up at night, thinking if all this been a dream, this cannot happen to me, i am not where i am, takes you a minutes to realize your reality, to put yourself to sleep every night wishing not to wake up again, then you remember that one person that you do not want hurt by leaving, or the people that their existence and well-being depends on your presence. you have tried everything, you avoided everyone, maybe even forced yourself to laugh and smile to give those around you the fake sign that you are alright, you know you hurt many, close ones and strangers, just because you do not have the ability to deal with emotions or events, sometimes you think how to make it up to countless of people when you get out of this reality, dreaming of better times where you can make yourself and others safe and happy. let us stop the time, now , cry if you can, its okay to cry, let some tears wash a little of your agony, pray if you believe in praying, there is no single path to healing , but i know healing will come, for me and for you, you will look at those days with silence, no regret, nothing but emptiness. you will find what you been struggling for without effort, sometimes the universe like to play with us by making the path of simple things difficult when we mix our desire with fear, amplifies all the negativity into events, but that is enough for now. just want to tell you that i am cheering for you, and we will be alright. from the heart to the heart",2

"i do not know if its ok to post twice in 24 hours but i keep thinking about it and i think i have a plan and date for when i die. it does not feel very solid but i guess it depends on how well this trip i am going on goes. i think the hotel we are staying at has a balcony and though i am terrified of heights i cannot stop vividly imagining climbing over the railing. everything just feels like its lost meaning and is not interesting anymore. i want to be excited for this trip but all i have thought about is how depressed i have been and when ill end it. i relapsed again last night but i have told no one close to me about how bad i have gotten. it just does not feel worth the time to tell them. they will just get upset and probably try to get me to go to a mental hospital or another therapist but i do not have the patience for it. i doubt ill do anything on this trip but the thought is tempting. even if i do enjoy myself and have fun though ill just go back home and go back to feeling empty and shit. i have put small signs to try and tell my friends i am not okay but i doubt i made them noticeable enough. not like anyone would see the evidence of my relapse either. i feel so apathetic to the consequences of my suicide that it makes me more and more convinced i am going to go through with it. there is just nothing else for me to live for, i never wanted to live this long. i do not want to put in any more effort anymore. i think it will be this month. before i turn twenty at the least. i do not want to start working again and lose the opportunity to do it. i think i have everything id need to do it, i did a bit of research for it to try and make it foolproof. if i really need more though it would not be hard to get it with some excuse. i do not care about the effects my death will have anymore. it will just hold me back. maybe i should write a note and post it for opinions. i do not know anymore i think i have a plan",6

"i have pretty much no good features, realistically no one should want to be friends with me and definitely no woman would want a romantic relationship with me. i am so trash i basically missed out on my youth. i am so far behind everyone and i am so inferior to everyone.i am ugly, i am short, i have a small dick, i am incompetent, a coward, i basically suck the life out of a room. there really is not a reason to live. it is not like i am a good person, or i add something to the world. i really should not have been born. it is such a shame my loving parents ended up with me. i really, i really am garbage. i am pathetic, whiny, incompetent trash. it would be a service if i kill myself, just not for my parents.even if i had some semblance of a personality or charisma. i can never escape the joke that is my body. my body is small in all ways and unwanted in all ways. it is something others would mock and make fun off. it is not something good looking or desirable. it is also weak and always will be weak compared to pretty much every other guy standing at you only 5ft. i mean i shop in the kids section. what woman wants someone like that, plus i can never have a normal sex life. the only sexual related content is that where someone with my body would be humiliated. that is all i am good for. i cannot ever be a normal man physically i am a joke there is always a better option. my mind is just as garbage i am not smart or competent, i am a coward, socially anxious, depressed, a pathetic sad sack, stupid. i have no discipline, no perseverance. i should have never been born. honestly i should just end it and be at peace. the only problems are my parents. however, if they are gone what is really stopping me. i am an only child, so only some aunts, uncles and some cousins. while they might be sad because of some youth nostalgia. it will be brief and they will get over it. besides having me as a cousin or nephew must be horrible and shameful. i am not a person who is good at socializing. i am not a person others want to be around. every bad quality, i probably have it. i do not see my life getting better. i do not see myself as competent. even if i manage to become somewhat competent or successful, i am always going to be a joke, i will not ever be enough. from my body to inexperience. i will always be a boy until i am an old man, well why bother, why not skip the last part.i really hate that this is bothering me, i hate that it is always on my mind. i really cannot wait to just sleep. i really hate myself from body to mind, i really am worthless.",6

"just had a date, and it was neutral i've seen two posts of two extremes in the past 24 hours here and r socialanxiety , one that went well ended with a kiss and one that apparently was awful but still a growing experience , so i figured i'd report my experience that was somewhere in the middle. recently had a girl message me on tinder and the conversation went really well flowed really naturally. she suggested we meet up, and considering how much i've progressed recently, i figured i wouldn't give myself enough time to reconsider doubt myself and just said yes. i was pretty chill for the most part, but my nerves got the best of me once there were only two hours left before the date, but it still wasn't nearly as bad as it would've been before. the date went pretty well. i was pretty nervous, but nothing that was overwhelming. we walked and talked a bunch, went to a small art exhibition, grabbed some ice cream and then i had to leave. overall a very pleasant experience despite the nervousness. i would have neeever in my life had thought that i'd be able to go on a tinder date fully sober. in the past i had to get blackout drunk other drugs to even text people on tinder, so i'm very very very glad i had the power in me to not cancel or chicken out and actually go through with this, even if nothing might come of it. i'll definitely have more confidence moving forward thanks to this experience. good luck out there!",4

"different experiences i got diagnosed as bipolar and it s been really difficult seeing other people online who have had different experiences than me with it. it kind of makes me feel like mine isn t real or that i m making it up somehow. its hard to see the person i am when i m manic as me. this all makes sticking to meds a challenge. i know i ll just end up talking to a wall by myself in a psych ward without them, but all of this makes it really hard to follow through. has anyone else felt this way?",1

i have a hard time articulating how i really feel and it frustrates me to no end i just wan na let it all out but it so hard it make it a lot difficult to seek help when i can t really explain what i m feeling and thinking about i can somewhat recognize what i m feeling but the moment i try to write it down or explain it my mind go blank though i can say a part of me doe feel guilty for unloading all my problem onto someone so maybe thats one of the reason i m unable to reach out to people for help plus another part of me is like trying to convince myself i m actually ok and faking it or being overdramatic which also stop me from saying anything so i usually turn to the internet to see if there s anyone who might feel the same way and could explain it in word better than i can i m sort of relieved to know that there are other people feeling exactly what i m feeling cause it really make me feel like i m not alone in this although it really suck that we all have to go through this i m not in a good state right now so i can t really give word of encouragement without feeling like a hypocrite but yeah you re definitely not alone in this,2

"i wish i could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all i really want in this life is to just be loved. to have someone who can actually touch me, most times i associate that with romance. amp but it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. the last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. the nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. how sad is it that i remember that after 3 months?! amp that was the only physical contact i have had in nearly 3 years and you wonder why i am constantly thinking about suicide? is it not obvious? amp i just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. but it is too much to ask and i know it is. i cannot do ""slow"". not only have i been cut off from physical contact, i have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. amp i do not know anyone where i live, i only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. seeing as how i am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. amp i frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because i am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. but if i do not cook, then we do not eat. if i do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. amp seems every day is just the same. wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all i can muster. amp this life has taken so much from me and all i have ever asked for was love. i have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love. amp it was a nice ideal while it lasted, i suppose. because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. you got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things. amp and yet, even as i have grown older, i still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999 of it is completely and entirely useless. amp just basic stuff, you know? like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a tv, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. you could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. amp how ironic, i suppose. i try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, i have the least amount of people in my life as well. who would have thought? amp i try to change, i try to convince myself that i can change. but i am still stuck here, in this reality and i cannot lie to myself. i cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. amp in honesty, i just do not want anything anymore. i want to want, but i do not want. the motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. i doubt much of anything ever could be. amp i have tried every single thing i could find. breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, i am even currently in therapy, i am taking medication every day and i suppose that is a 1 for me. i am starting to kind of build a morning routine and i am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference! amp i am still alone!! i am still useless!! i still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! i get the slightest hint of attention and i am like a fucking lost puppy! i will follow you off a fucking cliff!! amp none of this is factually making anything about my life better. i am still miserable, i am still addicted to video games and youtube and now reddit has fallen in along the lines so i guess you all are just going to need to ban me. so i can do ""more constructive things"" with my life. amp as if i want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! and it is just everything!! amp i do not know how i am supposed to do all of this and be this person that i am not and i have to do it all alone because i am so fucking worthless and i have made some real shit decisions in my life! amp i do not know how i am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after i pour out the darkest parts of me. amp i do not know how i am supposed to believe that things can get better when i am not seeing any real results from anything i am doing. my teeth are getting a bit whiter, so i guess that is the only real plus there. amp i do not know how i am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like i am going to explode and if that gets cut off... you can kiss all this progress goodbye. amp i have been starved for most of my life. in one way or another, or multiple ways. but i cannot ask people to understand that. i have to be the one to change and i cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since i am so damn sensitive to attention because i am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but i am supposed to just be ok with it. amp yeah, it is ok. it is ok. i do not mind. just go ahead and walk away, i do not mind. i do not mind. it is been awhile",2

"when i was younger i remember being so happy and curious about the world. i literally asked my parents hundreds of questions because i loved finding out about the world. when i got to my young teens i was still as curious, but i started to realise how fucked up the world was. id also fucked up by developing autogynephilia, which is arousal to the thought of being a woman. its all i ever masturbated to. this led me to developing gender dysphoria, but not enough to want to transition. i still have the thought in my mind but id never go through with it.i have only ever been truly in love with one girl, and since i have finished school for good about a month ago i am 16 she is now dating my old best friend. small world, i guess. i am scared of sex and intimacy in general, but i have actually seen them together in public or on social media together and it just makes me so numb and jealous because i think that should be me with her and not him. i have never liked someone like her. and of course now i have dysphoria it hurts even more for reason. just my luck.back to the dysphoria, its made me have thoughts of suicide for the first time in my life which really scared me. i just want to be like every other boy without getting this voice in my head telling me its not right. i have stopped working out and am avoiding masculine things in general, i even get dysphoria looking at my own dick. literally 3 months ago i liked it. apparently i am also conventionally attractive for a guy which i promise is not bragging because i do not even feel happy about it. i am so desperate to be able to talk that as a compliment but i just fucking cannot. i just feel betrayed by my own brain. how am i going to live a good life when everyday i wake up hopeless. i have just applied for my first job in a bar but i am so anxious to fill out the forms. i am 3 days late to do it. mostly from the dysphoria but i just have anxiety in general, as well.i was always told id be something great, i was called the gifted kid which as a lot of people know is not very good thing surprisingly. i feel like i have wasted my life already and i am only 16. what is the point in going forward if its just going to be this??? i feel like i have been cursed. i have always tried to be a good person and do the right things for my future, but now i just feel like none of that matters anymore.what is the point in life if all you can do is watch others enjoy themselves, but not yourself? i do not want to watch others live the life that i want, which is just people that are comfortable in their own skin. and you want to know why i am like this?? i got horny at a fucking crossdresser when i was 11. how fucking dumb is that. i feel like i am not even going to make it to 20 if it carries on like this. i am actually laughing at myself. how the fuck have i messed up this badly lmaooo. fuck life. i feel like a wasted life.",2

"i do not know why but i can kill myself even if i want to die and i really want to hurt myself.i hate me a lot, and i want me to suffer but even when i cut myself i do it where it cannot really harm myself, where it is just a bit of pain and distracts me for a moment from other thoughts.i guess i prefer to die more ""naturally"" like in a car accident or from illness.the best way to die for me would be doing some heroic shit like saving someone from a car crash or a fire, i would be proud of myself for a moment at least, and hopefully it would hurt less to my family and friends if i die doing something good instead of killing me to stop this suffer. i am a coward self harm suicidal post",2

"like basically every night i think about whether or not i should do it and the main reason that i do not is that if i do not die i will probably go to the hospital and go to like a psych ward or something and i just do not want to go through that. but i also vaguely like the thought of trying and not actually dying. would it be somehow cathartic to do something that almost definitely will not kill me but feels like i am killing myself just to see if i would do it? i used to live in a place where i could just off the building, but now my only real option is to take a bunch of pills. i collected a bunch of pills from around my house and have them in my room. i have a glass of water rn. i could take them. i do not think i want to die right now. idk. every single day feels exactly the same. last time i made a real plan to do it, it felt final. that day i felt that feeling of today, today, today i never actually attempted . i feel like i am just waiting for something to happen, for a day to feel different from the others so i can feel that feeling of finality, and just come upstairs and take all these pills. i guess if i actually wanted to do it, i would have stopped trying to do my schoolwork by now. i am so scared of attempting and not dying. it would make everything so much shittier. risk of not dying is the main thing stopping me",6

"being the crazy lady i m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. it s quite severe, i get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, i still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. the consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. i haven t been able to hold a job and am on disability. unlike many of you that i see here i am often not able to catch myself, and once it s at a certain point i lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest i m not ok. last year i seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. but that came crashing down when i was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the new year i d done nothing criminal but i guess i must ve been acting strange . one of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how i acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. in retrospect i could have been seriously harmed or worse when i used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. nowadays i mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. i ve lost friends, like many of us. that irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet, you know? i just wondered if anyone could relate.",1
i met this woman off tinder for a hookup. on my profile i mentioned that i like having sex with women with vaginas after she asked me what my preference was. she never disclosed me that she was a woman with a penis even though she is the one who asked me what my preference was. this woman and i talked and video chatted and met up at a hotel.we were getting undressed then i saw that she had male genitalia. once i saw this i asked her what was going on?? she told me it does not matter if she had a penis and that sex was sex and she is still a woman. i told her that i was not comfortable and did not want to proceed.once i did that she completely flipped on me. i tried to leave the room. she would not let me call the front desk or 911. she ripped the phone out my hands and threw it down. she pinned me down on the floor. i tried to fight her off but could not. she entered me then raped me. this was the first time inhad ever been penetrated. she then tried to strangle me and i tried screaming as loud as i could. i bit her face as hard as i could and i kicked her in her penis area and ran into the hallway. i was only in panties and a bra. i screamed for helped and yelled fire!!!. three people came out their rooms and tried to help me. i told them i had been raped and beaten.she then ran out the room still trying to charge at me and the guy out of the three had to hold her back. one of the women who came out of her room gave me her robe and slippers and went down with me to the lobby.the hotel manager took me into their office and asked me what happened then called the police. 4 officers showed up.the hookup who raped me came down to the lobby told the police that i was lying and was crazy. i showed them my bruises. they told me they had no proof that she did that and she also told the officer that if they take her to jail then they are violating her human rights because she is a trans woman.they asked me questions and the hotel manager let 2 of the officers get access into the hotel room to try and take evidence but there was none because she raped me on the floor. i said i wanted a rape kit. they said they have no proof that it was not consensual. they took a report but did not take her to jail. i requested an ambulance who took me to the hospital where i received a rape kit. my hookup was never arrested. i am speaking to lawyers now but do not know what to do.i am extremely distressed and mentally compromised. i am with my family now and took screenshots of our texts and app chats.i keep calling the police department and they keep saying that they have forwarded my report to the prosecutor but i have heard nothing back and its been 5 days.this happened in the state of california as i was there visiting a friend for a week.what are my options? what would you do in this situation? i am in desperate need of help! i was raped this past weekend by a woman with a penis and the police told me they cannot do anything about it because the woman with a penis told them she did not do it. the woman threatened to report the officers for being transphobic if they arrested her then they dismissed me. now i am suicidal.,6

'you can't put a roof on in winter.' and she was stressed about it for me in the beginning because she thought it was a 2 bedroom house even though i sent her the listing that showed it was a 3 bedroom . and she was stressing me out, where i had all my shit in order. i've had all my shit in order so much that i haven't had to gather paperwork or do anything for the past 3 and a half weeks. i've been twiddling my thumbs, just waiting . and i texted a couple people from game night, who haven't texted me back. and i'm stressed about it. and i'm worried they all collectively decided i was crazy and to stop talking to me because that's what i tell myself when i'm depressed - that i'm useless and a burden and everyone would be better off without me. even my friend who i was supposed to babysit for on saturday hasn't gotten back to me. i feel so alone, and i feel like i'm doing it to myself. because i am. edit heard back from one friend. still on for babysitting at least. she's awesome. people don't hate me. but i still feel crappy.",1

"nothing makes me happy long term. whenever things that do make me joy in the short term, they always lead to a nose dive of depression afterwards. i have crippling anxiety that does not seem to get any better not matter what i do.i understand that that is life. that all good things mush come to end. but that is the point. there was a quote about this from a show that i will never forget, it goes ""that is exactly it, are the best parts of life just finding momentary distractions to keep yourself busy so you do not think about the harsh reality of life for a second? i can ride roller coasters, meet new friends, and spend time with my family all day long. it is does not change the fact that ... all of this was for nothing.""i see a life i do not want. the way the economy is going, constantly being burnt out, living paycheck to paycheck, having to put up with abusive bosses because i rely on them to survive. and quite frankly, i do not see anything changing. the people at the top will continue to make everyone is life more miserable if it means they get to continue to live in luxury. if anything, things are going to get worst.i am in the weird half-way point. i have made the decision that in two years time, if nothing improves, i am going to die. i do not want to mindlessly suffer just for the thin possibility that things might get better. despite this, i do not know if i want to die, like, i want to, but then i will not be able to feel those little bits of joy. conversely, it will not matter because i will be dead. it is not i will be conscious to know what i am missing.as far as i know, there is no afterlife. many of the worlds religons say that there is a hell. i do not know. i am not relgious. so many people say so many different things that its impossible to know. i just hope that if there is a god that he is merciful and understand my mental suffering. when i posted my previous post in suicide watch my karama on the top of the page was 66 6 and when i got out bed i looked at the time it wsa 11 34, and the 4 in my clock looks like an upside down h. am i looking too much into this? was it just a wild coincidence or is there some force beyond my control? i do not want to die, i just do not want deal with the way life is. i need anther person's perspective.",2

i dont remember the first year of my life due to my father and his friend molesting me till mum finally managed to get away from him my earliest memory is drowning at the age of and having no one to care about me afterwards i wa just sent on my way at 0 i wa accused of beating my little brother when nobody wa looking mum refused to believe me even when he finally said it wa a kid at school that wa the first time i nearly killed myself life ha not gotten better my sister married another abuser my step dad lost the house and car and my mum is a neurotic mess who couldn t give a shit about me besides a her emergency atm i dont see why i should bother with life when this is all i have known it literally never get better i finally know how i will do it i have given myself week to see if i still want to do it and nothing ha changed my family probably wont know for a while nor care so this may be my only chance to say good bye life is just shit for some people i lost before i got a chance to start and i am fine with that now i suppose,2

"some very helpful words to put things in perspective this is an article i found that makes me feel profoundly better every time i read it. i posted it as a comment a few weeks ago, but i thought it might reach help more people as its own post. it seems relevant to some recent posts on this sub. i'll post the url in the comments, but here it is ""we all worry about our health from time to time, at least to some degree, but some people worry excessively about catastrophic consequences of seemingly benign symptoms. they re known as hypochondriacs. this is the sort of process hypochondriacs go through what s that? a benign lump or malignant bump on your face, breast or rump? adrenaline rush, heart pumping, sweating, and light-headedness follow, confirming the gravity of the terminal self-diagnosis. thoughts racing and images of a foreshortened future, orphaned children, and opportunities missed. overwhelming distress. must plan the epitaph see, i told you i was sick! our future and physical health are inherently uncertain. but people with hypochondriasis immediately resolve any uncertainty about novel physical sensations and symptoms on the side of catastrophe. the body is constantly in a state of flux. the heart pumps, blood flows, muscles twitch, lungs inflate, and bowels contract. strange symptoms come and go. and most pass without conscious awareness as we focus on daily tasks. but try this. hold your hand upwards, so that your palm and fingertips face the sky. focus all your attention on the tips of your fingers and wait and wait until you notice some sensations. tingling, temperature changes, or just an awareness of the sensations on your skin. here s an even simpler task. as you read this, shift your attention on to the sensations of the ground or chair pushing up against your body. chances are you were unaware of all these sensations just moments ago. attention, you see, is the microscope of the mind. it can filter in or out any of your internal or external experiences. now imagine becoming hypervigilant to all the physical changes naturally occurring in your body. try it. just focus on all the sensations in your body for a minute. amazing, isn t it? itchy toes, tense jaw, mild headache, numbness, and so on. all the normal workings of a healthy body. people with somatic symptom disorder are experts at searching for and noticing normal bodily changes. they re also experts at interpreting these in potentially catastrophic ways fatigue is leukemia a lump on the arm is cancer. the number one enemy of someone with the disorder is dr google cyberchondria . indeed, the only thing more catastrophically creative than a hypochondriac s mind is google s 2.42 million webpages on the causes of cancer. every possible symptom can be linked to every possible diagnosis, by at least one disreputable source or another. the hypochondriac is searching not for information, but for confirmation of their imminent demise. if they re unlucky, they might come across contradictory information or additional ailments they hadn t yet considered. their intense worry and anxiety feel intolerable and must be neutralised. seeking out a sympathetic doctor or other source of reassurance, or avoiding the health section of the newspaper all provide temporary relief until the next physical symptom is perceived. so what are some things that keep hypochondriacs worrying? belief worrying will help me catch something early. no, it won t. worrying will just keep you miserable until you re old enough to find out how you will shuffle off this mortal coil unless, of course, your demise is a blissfully brief surprise . worry itself will not get you any closer to predicting, preventing, or planning for your death. belief i can get certainty about my health. nope, can t get that either. no amount of checking, doctor visits, googling, reassurance-seeking will guarantee with 100 certainty that you re well. i can, however, guarantee that the unrelenting pursuit of certainty will make you miserable. so, how can you manage health anxiety? first, develop some healthy guidelines for monitoring your health and stick to them. based on your past experience, how long do benign symptoms typically last? one day, two days, one week? decide how long you will wait before seeking any form of certainty or reassurance from the internet, friends, family, or medical practitioners the next time you notice a symptom, especially ones you ve worried about in the past. once this time expires no pun intended , make a decision about whether you need to get the symptom checked or whether you can wait another little while before doing so. follow guidelines from reputable sources about the recommended frequency of body checking. and, be willing to sit with uncertainty about your health. none of us ever have certainty about our health. i could have a brain tumour as i write these words. i am willing to accept this possibility and shift my attention onto the next paragraph. think about it this way if i offered you a 2 million insurance policy for your house, even if i promised to build you a gold-plated replacement if it were destroyed, you would likely consider it far too expensive. so, how much are you willing to pay to prevent any possibility of illness? are you willing to give up your capacity to work, time you would otherwise spend with friends and family, and ultimately your happiness? this is a very high price to pay. spend energy on things you truly value, rather than wasting it on a false insurance policy. learn to accept uncertainty about your health. revel in not knowing when or how the end will come. focus instead on the time between now and then. ultimately, what you have to decide is which epitaph you would prefer when your inevitable end arrives lived decades in misery and fear of death , or didn t see that coming but my life was far richer for it.",0

today has been one of my toughest days. how do yall get through heartbreak? my love has made me feel so horrible today. i feel like part of us is missing now that i may not be able to move on from in this relationship. i really just need some kind words right now. i feel my worth to her isn't the same anymore. she says it is but her actions dont show it. ive had a rock in my chest since i woke up 18 hours ago and cant sleep. i cant go to any of my friends right now because they will hate her. im just feel so alone in this.,2
i really feel like i do not belong anywhere in this world. i just lost my shitty job at the grocery store and now i have to find a new job. all of the jobs i end up getting my me hate my life soo much i want to find a better job that i would actually enjoy but i really do not know how to do that because none of the jobs i want ever want me. i have been trying to get a nice job at a pet store and doggy daycare but they are rarely ever hiring and whenever they are i do not hear anything back from them. so i am stuck working jobs that make me want to kill myself. i do not know how much longer i can handle working shitty jobs just so i can eat.. i am probably going to have to be a dishwasher again since nobody else wants to hire me i do not want to be on this stupid planet anymore. nobody gives a fuck about how i feel i feel so fuckin unwanted in this world,6

"adequate protein intake my last post was removed for being pseudo-science. fair enough. here are a few sources that recommend eating at least 1g protein per kg of bodyweight ""a new study that focused on nutrition and mental health of adolescent athletes found an association between high protein consumption and a decrease in symptoms of depression."" ""the indicator amino acid oxidation-based requirement values of 0.93 and 1.2 g protein kg day and the reanalysis of existing nitrogen balance studies are significantly higher than current recommendations. therefore, there is an urgent need to reassess recommendations for protein intake in adult humans."" ""higher protein intakes increase satiety, which is particularly helpful if you re trying to cut calories as part of a weight-loss diet"" ""the recommended dietary allowance rda for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. the rda is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. in a sense, it s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day."" as you can see, making sure you eat enough protein improves depression symptoms, helps weight loss but is not a panacea which we struggle with, and is generally deemed to be safe. the mainstay advice is at least 0.8g protein per kg bodyweight. it is generally recommended to get this protein from plant sources and also engage in physical activity.",1

"my brother 27 has recently become suicidal and tried to drive off a cliff. my family and i called 911 and he was luckly found not hurt and he spun out his car on a road on the edge of a canyon. i love this guy more then i can explain, i mean he is my twin so i feel his pain. maybe not the way you think but if anybody could understand his pain it would be me. we are both male twins and he has been with me through the bad times as a child and somehow the even worst times as an adult. he is a fucking musical genius, awards in college for trombone and guitar and he knows how to play almost any instrument. i was more of a sports athlete and fanatic. we are different but so similar that it hurts when he tells me he does not belong here anymore. because he is the most good damn unique person i have ever met. he became sad because his band broke up and then lost a girlfriend of 5-7 years. on and off dating for last 2 years he has always been a heavy drinker but he always snapped back to his positive self when he had troubles before. he is on suicide watch until tomorrow morning where they will evaluate him to see if he needs to be admitted for 72 hours. this is the first time this has happened. and i do not know what to do next. i want to support him no matter what. i guess i want to know how do i support him with out making him more overwhelmed or make him feel like he has done something wrong? it is not his fault life hit him so hard. he does not want to hurt others, he just wants to not feel his pain. i need help. my twin brother tried to drive off a cliff.",6
"i am 17 years old and i have been having to deal with my parents who often have yelling matches, physical altercation, and trash the house during fits of anger. i have been dealing with this my whole life and it just gets so hard to deal with. tonight it got pretty bad when my dad started to beat my mother, and then continued with a belt. i broke it up and watch as they threw and broke things. i am a year away from leaving to college but i just do not know how much longer i can last. i feel so lonely and scared and i hate to be home. i want to leave so fucking badly and it does not help that they drink and even do drugs from time to time. luckily they do not hit me and they do so much to support me and are not neglectful at all. it is just that they hate each other and the hate mixed with drugs and alcohol erupts into so much shit. i feel empty, tired, and lonely having to deal with this almost every week and in the past i have had suicidal thoughts but i am smart enough not to actually do it. i just think it is fucked up to even have those thoughts at a young age and watching your parents hurt each other. i just do not know what to do to help anything and just waiting for college to come is getting so hard to do. would love some advice help from anyone... i live with domestically abusive parents and i do not know how much more i can take...",2

"i don t know how to behave in group chats and it s destroying me mentally. so to start off, i don t have many friends and i don t participate in many discords, so i admit i m a little out of practice here. but recently my three cousins decided we should all be part of a group chat and rekindle the bond we had as kids. i was all for it, they re family and i love em, but just existing in this group chat is giving me some major anxieties. it also doesn t help that i have absolutely nothing in common with any of them. all they talk about is work, their s o s and gossip. they said we would be sending each other memes but every meme they ve sent so far have been the most unfunny monotonous tiktok reaction videos i ve ever seen. i don t even know how to respond to them so so far i just haven t. now after about 3 days the group chat is silent and i feel like they ve silently moved on. i just know it s going back to the usual where i only ever talk to them at family gatherings, which is another awkward thing i m going to stress about. i really am at a loss of how to handle myself, and i fear that if i eventually get into a group chat of other friend groups it ll go the same way. i ve tried joining discords before of varying sizes in the past, but nowadays everyone types so fast and gets their thoughts out in seconds. i feel like by the time my brain is even able to process what was said and think of a response, they ve already changed topics. has anyone else here had to deal with this kind of thing before?",0

it's so tight that it's hard for me to breathe.,3
"swallowing air, mostly when laying on my back since the start of this year i ve had really weird symptoms. it started when i suddenly noticed some faint clicking noises at the back of my throat. i got very scared because i was high on weed at that time and since weed does trigger paranoia i was sent into a full-blown panic attack. while being in a panic attack i first started swallowing a lot of air due to an anxiety reflex. after sobering up, i was back to normal. but stupid me thought it was okay to smoke weed again so i had my next panic attack, shaking and just feeling and hearing all the air move in my stomach and abdomen. at this point i quit smoking. yet after that incident i noticed, that whenever i laid down on my back and swallowed mostly the normal spit-swallow reflex i could hear and feel tiny air bubbles travel down my esophagus. this happens absolutely subconsciously, i cannot control it. i ve also noticed how sometimes my ears and my throat hurts. now i ve become extremely aware of how i breathe, how i swallow and when i feel or hear something weird in my body and this led to searching the internet for various reasons as to why this may be happening to me. i ve thought about hiatus hernia the conditions where the diaphragm pushes into the stomach or the esophagus , gerd but i ve never noticed any acidic reflux , and so on... it s gotten so bad that some nights i can t even sleep because i m having such bad anxiety about my symptoms... i ve gone to three different doctors, the first one completely ignored my symptoms and just said the bloating comes from an intestinal infection or something like that idk , the second one sent me to a therapist to whom i ll go to in march and the third one didn t find anything wtong with me, just like the first one. it s extremely hard for me to live with this condition, because wherever i searched, i ve found absolutely nothing that actually led me to an illness or such. i m using simeticon to relieve the bloating, because i m not able to burp all of the air out. but i may add that i do burp a lot because of the subconcious air swallowing which sometimes happens eventhough i m not laying down. when i lay down on my back though, it happens almost constant. i was wondering if anyone here has or had something similar to this?",0
"acceptance this is a difficult topic to discuss but i'm genuinely curious as to if how others have done this and what impact it has had on their lives. the kind of acceptance i'm talking about isn't just an intellectual acknowledgement of having issues. for a long time, for example, i could say to myself that i'm depressed, anxious, and struggling to succeed in life, at least by metrics of the culture that i reside in. that's relatively easy to do. what i'm speaking of is a shift in perspective where you allow yourself to be disabled and accept living life very differently than what is expected. in doing so, you effectively turn off the mechanism that activates masking, which exposes vulnerabilities, and just say ""f it, i'll deal with the consequences"". this means that 1 you accept that you'll be targeted by others, misunderstood, and often viewed as low status, because generally people aren't very understanding of problems that aren't obvious, like a physical disability. 2 you accept that you're not likely to be appealing attractive to potential or existing romantic interests. this is particularly salient to men, who are selected for traits that showcase an ability to provide. 3 you accept that you'll need emotional, financial and or vocational assistance for the remainder of your adult years. as such, you must let go of a desire for a fully independent lifestyle. 4 you accept that, in all likelihood, what you have to say won't hold much value to others outside of a supportive setting. maybe you didn't have much to say anyways. 5 you accept a humility of attitude and position. you are no longer competing with others in the rat race, at least not directly, and have no need to get ahead.. and.. 6 you accept that you weren't motivated to do so to begin with. moving mountains around just isn't your thing. an image comes to mind of a disheveled man holding a sign on the street corner. i imagine there's no pride left to speak of in someone like that. just acceptance that the world isn't meant for some kinds of people. i know this sounds depressing but this is where i'm at in considering how to proceed with my life. it feels as though i'm flailing around, grabbing at the air helplessly, in some futile effort to grasp on to an ideal of something i'm not.. a normal, self-sufficient person. just to be clear, i don't want to be homeless. i'd hope to do just enough to avoid that. but what this level of acceptance implies is a sense of freedom to be myself, as i am in the present moment, without fighting it. the idea here is to do something radically different to change my outlook and ease the stress that i'm experiencing. i would guess others here can relate to that stress, which is the definition of avpd. so, has anyone taken this journey and would be willing to share some wisdom? is this kind of acceptance a good idea? or does anyone want to share their thoughts, generally? it's important to add that this isn't a great idea for young folks. this is something you would consider later on, after having tried and tried again.",4

"i did not mean to ghost them, but all i know now is that i can actually never kill myself because it hurts them. it hurts them when i do not talk to them. it hurt me too, but i cannot stop being mentally unwell and exhausted and having my brain plagued with intrusive thoughts and anxiety and depression. i just want to fucking die. i am not happy. i will not be happy for a long time and i really cannot fucking take it. i want to fucking drown. i want to die. i had a dream last night that i got 2 cockatiels as a pets. i brought a new cage for them and put it next to my budgies cage. my mum was enraged, and proceeded to beat the shit out of me abs scream at me. in the dream my friends arrived and watched me get beaten up. as i lost more and more blood they just stood there. one of them intervened after a while but i woke up shortly after, when i died in my dream.i fucking wish that was real. i wish i could see them, i wish i could die. i wish i could die not at my own hands and have them know that. i do not want to traumatise them tho. i feel awful. because i do not want them to suffer, they are amazing people but i really want to fucking die. i want to suffocate. i am sorry. i am really sorry. why cannot i stop hurting the people in my life?",6
"one of the things i find most offensive about what people say about our music is when they say 'its depressing'. the reason i find it offensive is that..... to me that implies that to suffer from depression is like being..... subnormal..... it is a stigma, which it should not be, because there is an awful lot of people who suffer from depression. and it shoild be something that is like an ultimate swear word, because..... i suffer from it and a lot of people suffer from it. it should be something that is openly discussed and accepted. i happen to make music sometimes when i am in that frame of mind because i suffer from it. actually sometimes it is not suffering, its a bonus..... because a lot of creative power is from that feeling. thom yorke on people calling radiohead's music depressing",2

"so many people have claimed that i just need to wait and see. but i am so fucking tired of waiting. ever since i was 12, i have wanted to die. me being 25 has not changed that one iota. no matter what happens, it all ends in failure. everything around me is stagnant while everyone else is going on to do amazing things. my sister is several hours away, married to a wonderful guy. my mom lives in an entirely difficult country who just recently got re-married without letting anyone else know what was going on. all of my friends from college have gone on to get jobs. and i am stuck living in a shithole of an apartment with my verbally abusive father.i do not have anyone who i can turn to, if i try to talk to my mom about it, she gaslights me and makes me feel like a loser for complaining about having a roof over my head. if i try to talk to my friends about it, they will just twist my words into them just talking about their issues. i am sincerely tempted to go toss back a bottle of pills and just pray that it works this time. nothing ever changes, no one actually cares until it is useful to them, the only things that give me any hope for the future are my dreams. and even those are not enough after thirteen years of suffering. i want to stay asleep forever and stay in my dreams",2

"help me. anyone else had the struggle of being pushed into a wrong diagnosis? hey so this is my first post here and i need some advice as this has been stressing me out. sorry if it s a bit long . basically after about 5 years of therapy at multiple hospitals with multiple people i got diagnosed with bipolar 2. it was such a relief to know what was wrong with me and why these sudden breakdowns and well mental episodes had been happening to me. it fit and was comforting having confirmation that it s not me or who i am. i have bad depressive episodes roughly every two years, always when i m perfectly content with my life, no events no reasonable triggers nothing. manics have been less visible to my hospital as well i was off doing far more important things e.g my ,now i look back on it, completely incoherent master piece of an application to a prestigious design school. instead of attending appointments. although they did see a couple days which confirmed to them bipolar. in between those times i m just normal happy average george. so getting to the point my second admittion to the priory hospital private so not related to my previous treatment happened last year during a depressive episode. in one session my consultant told me he didn t think it was bipolar. i asked why, his response was nothing more than you don t look like someone with bipolar what the fuck does that mean?!? so he told me in his opinion it s bpd. disregarding my previous years under the nhs who all agreed on bipolar. now i m out patient and have been back home nearly a year and doing really well despite having had loss and a difficult home life. he s referred me to a therapist. turns out she only treats personality disorders. i had my first session with her and she went through the criteria of what is needed for a diagnosis of bpd. that s what he had changed my diagnosis to on my notes!!! i ve met him maybe 5 times over two years including inpatient stays. now with bipolar i do have the symptoms she is describing but only when i have episodes. when i made it clear it s only in episodes that these are present and my episodes tend to be separated by months or years where none of these symptoms exist she scoffed and said that doesn t matter and ticked them off anyway. im finding it hard having people try to make out that the way i am when i m ill is a problem with my personality and therefore something i can control. i came to this subreddit as i m hoping you understand how horrible it is for someone to 1. make out like you have control over this by changing your thinking. 2. and taking away the only thing that makes sense of why i do and say and feel these intense almost out of body episodes. i know full well it s not like me to go out for three days and not sleep going to random places not having any sense of danger and losing who i am. i m not putting anyone with bpd down. it s just a very different experience when it feels chemical. i would choose bipolar over bpd any day because i have long periods of time of being normal. i m really scared they are going to change my meds and what treatments they ll give me. anyone had similar to this??? sorry it s so long x",1
"i don t like it when people ask me how i am because i am trying to not think about all the negative things that i am going through and as soon as someone asks me this question, it reminds me that things are not okay and i get sad. not only that, but 9 10 times, people ask this question because it became a habit and not because they actually care how you are. it has become just an addition or an alternative to ""hello"". i only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and i would actually care to find out what's wrong. someone might say ""what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them?"" then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it like many of us . i always say that i am fine just because i don't want to explain to them my issues because they would not understand at all and i know this because i have tried this many times. i believe many people here also feel the same or at least something similar to this.",2

"i am honestly not doing so fucking hot. i have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. i really do not know what is going on with me. at first i thought it was burnout from uni....but now i have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that i am graduated, i just feel like shit. i was an emotional mess back in april, and now i just feel numb. i still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. i am not happy anymore, i am not sad anymore, i am just....there? i am just so beyond exhausted. past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. i am an overachiever, my cgpa is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. career wise, life is good. i am at my prime, and i feel so confident in that. but in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. decided to go out of my comfort zone and try out dating, the dude i briefly talked to turned out to also was similar. my parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. my dads health has been steadily declining. my pcos got out of control. my sibling and parents fight constantly. my parents fight with each other constantly. covid is still very much flourishing. what are the fucking odds. every year i tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and i end up disappointing myself. like, i can never catch a break. and literally i do not know anything about personal boundaries. i am so quick to commit to being there for people in my life, but i have realized that i am never there for myself. apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, i learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. and now- i just feel like i am passing my threshold of tolerance. i want to move out, but i know that that is going to be financially irresponsible of me. i need to be there for myself, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. i feel so fucking lonely, but i want to be left alone. i am so fucking sick of shit, but i have to push through. i am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but i am so close to just crashing. fuck, i need a hug. need to vent",2

"i will try to keep this relatively brief if i can. i am suffering. i was diagnosed with ""severe depression with suicidal tendencies and ptsd"" when i was 12 years old. i received treatment and things went generally smoothly up until this year. i have joined the military 3 years ago and this job has absolutely stressed me beyond anything i could have imagined. i started having severe depressive episodes to the point where i have come extremely close to killing myself multiple times for years. on top of that, i am in charge of a specific section with only one person in it besides me so with the workload, my own extreme loneliness, and not being able to take a vacation for more than a week, i am at my lowest point of my life. i have tried so hard to make things better with myself by working out and getting in better shape, going out with my work friends more, and taking time for myself...but nothing is working for me anymore. i just go home and lay down on the couch to watch youtube and tv and just wallow in pain. i no longer take care of myself, just enough to not raise any suspicions about me at work. i lie so much to everyone that i have a great life when in reality i am a fucking failure with no luck in terms of romance, sex, friendships, being a good brother son uncle, and a good leader. i feel like my empathy has died because i am starting to notice that i only really care for babies and animals, not even my family i can empathize with anymore. i sleep about 2 hours at night, i barely eat anymore, i barely work out, and i barely leave my house besides for food. i have turned to binge drinking just so i can feel some sort of happiness because being alone with my thoughts in painful. i cannot cry anymore and all i feel is constant anxiety, stress, and this seething rage that just never goes away. my family has a history of mental illness and i hypothesize that i might have bipolar 1, but i cannot get it diagnosed. because of my status as a military member, i cannot get it diagnosed because i know that i will get kicked out for it being a ""psychotic mood disorder"". i know it is best to get some professional help because if my supervisors and family knew how badly i wanted to kill myself, it would more than likely ruin my life and reputation. i am trying to hold out til next year when i officially get out and can move away and move on to a better job, but i do not know if i can hold out anymore. i still have hope that things will get better but that light is starting to fade and i am seriously contemplating just ending my life before i ever really had a chance to live it. i want the things normal people have but i do not know if i ever will. i want to establish roots in a community, have a family, live a normal life with friends and family...but i do not think i ever could. i cannot imagine i will get better and it haunts me that i am a 22 year old man and i might end up in hell, or the nothing, or whatever the fuck we end up. i want to find peace and just live a normal life....a better life than the one i have only seemed to ever know. my heart hurts so much and i really do wish to get better, but i do not know if i ever will. i do not even know where to start to change myself. please help me because i do not think i am strong enough to help myself anymore... i do not know where else to go now.",2
"i just feel so trapped. so trapped.i try so hard, i really do. whenever i get a new full time job i am very eager, i work hard. but as the weeks go by, i can feel everything falling apart. i stop exercising, i stop eating well, i am tired all the time.i feel like i expend more energy than normal people. an 8 hour work day completely floors me, even in a non-toxic work environment. i come home feeling spent. i do not have the energy to work on myself. i do not have the energy to run my errands, or manage my house, or keep my appointments. i forget important tasks all the time.working part time i usually feel better, energy and health wise. but, then i cannot afford to improve myself. i cannot afford the gym, or healthy food, or a nice quiet apartment, or my hobbies. so then i get depressed anyway.i am really scared. i am scared things will not get better. i am scared i will never be able to live a normal, comfortable life. i am scared i will never have the energy or money for my hobbies, or for my loved ones. it makes me want to give up now, before i suffer even more whenever i work full time, i get horribly depressed. but i fear i will never be able to live a comfortable life working part time. i feel like i was born to fail.",2
"i have confirmed my stance as a member in my own family an absolute failure. i blew away most of my own family and friends, and i haplessly threw my life on the line. i may have failed more than i would like to admit, but a day will come where i will succeed. those who are closest to me are the ones i hurt the most. the ones who truly cared about me, i stabbed them and twisted the blade.its finally time the blade goes where it should have gone long ago. i have officially gone to far...",6

"my husband had recently confessed he had cheated on me. he implores me to forgive him. we have been just two years into our marriage. it is my second marriage, and my ex was also kind of an asshole. i have lost faith in having a good, honest relationship. i am far away from my parents' home in another country and i do not have here anyone who is close. and if my parents were here, i would not ever seek support from them, because my father is a tyrant and i hate him. i am 32, i do not have a paid job here, i am a teacher in training and that training will last till the end of 2021. but above all this, i really loved my husband. i do not want to 'seek for a right guy' and marry again. been there, done that. having a family has always been the most important thing for me, since i come from a wrecked, fucked-up family. now it is gone, and i do not want to live anymore. i want to commit suicide, because this entire world is just a big hole full of shit. i try to come up with the reasons why i should not do this, but cannot find a single worthy one. i do not want to live anymore.",6

"felt that way since middle and high school classmates started seeing my early stages of depression as ""seeking attention"" while being rejected by crushes often and bullied since fourth grade and abused by my dad and neglected by my mom because she is powerless to stop the abuse because she is a victim herself. with that being said fast forward to today.now i am in 25k of credit card debt living in regret. suicidally depressed and still getting rejected online and dealing with friends who are in relationships and make no effort to spend time with me when i need it when i break down mentally. dealing with an abusive older brother and relatives who are oblivious to the abuse and do not know about my debt and severity of my depression not that they would care.i feel like i cannot trust nobody. i have nobody to talk to when i am lonely. nobody fucking wants me, nobody cares about me because otherwise i would not feel lonely and the need to make these posts that nobody will read on this cruel fucking website full of toxic assholes who do not even care about anything that is not riddled with upvotes. working jobs that do not make enough to cover daily expenses and even constant family drama involving me, my depression, diabetes and my lack of exercise due to excess sleep due to a culmination of the three illnesses making me want to sleep and never wake up.i want sweet release, i want to escape and since it is so fucking easy for everyone else to get into a relationship and get married and shit. fucking hell even abusive and neglectful women i have met who treated me like shit get away with it and go on to live happy lives. so fuck it. i am not going to care anymore. everyone always seems to lie to me about how everything is going to be okay while i am here still suffering even after taking lexapro on the daily making me impotent and doing nothing to help with my sleep deprivation. this world sucks and something has to be done about it.i hate living here and i wish i never should have been born. because then i would not be abused, neglected, touch starved, emotionally drained and lacking basic human needs like love. people say everyone deserves love right? so why is it so fucking hard to get it? people are just cruel. that is why i will never care or empathize again because if life taught me anything it is that cruelty and apathy pays the big bucks in this depraved world. depression taught me i cannot trust people anymore",2
"wasted opportunities anyone one else kinda smart but because of zero social skills, they never made it i have load of education and a degree, but during my degree i was an avoidant mess who struggled socially, and once i left there and tried to work it was just traumatic. i'm 30 now and never worked in the field my degree is in and never plan to. i have just closed the door on that part of my life and im still just surviving lol. i hop from one meaningless job to the next, usually low paid, and then when people start judging me cos they can see i'm intelligent, and are like why the fuck are you here, i create distance, then bail out of shame",4

"i called my boyfriend, and i just ranted at him. he was shocked. i've never spoken like that about anyone. i wasn't even thinking about what was coming out of my mouth, and i just called her all these names and said all these horrible things about her when she isn't a bad person! how the hell do i get over this?",5
"i cannot tell if i am really a bad person or not. writing stuff for context i was going through trauma and abuse 4 years ago, took my anger out on others to unhealthily cope, almost made someone kill themself, am constantly reminded of it to this day.i made a joke about significant events that happened in my life, that being one of them and my partner thought i am scary because i joked about it and did not understand why i should not have, i still do not. maybe i really just am a horrible person but i do not get it. the joke was not about that one event specifically, i was just listing things out and no one actually got hurt during that, everyone is fine and healthy now and it was 4 years ago so i do not see why listing it out in a joke is bad. i said i would not joke about it anymore if it is fucked up but he said he wants me to actually understand, which i am not sure i am able to. i do not know if me not being able to understand what is so wrong about it is because of my autism, actually being a shitty person or is actually justified. if there is no hope for me i would gladly rather kill myself than live as someone unable to be a good person insight needed",6
"hello, first time poster.sigh, i am just so stressed. i have been therapy for 2 years now and on antidepressants for 4 months. i feel like ill always be depressed and life is pointless. although i have gotten a bit better, i still want to in the near future. i have so much going for me i am intelligent, beautiful, i have great friends, i have a great career ahead of me not saying all this to show off haha but i do not want any of it. i just do not want a life, do not want to be here anymore.quite honestly i do not want to die, i do not want to be killed, i just want to be undone. i want to drive away and just disappear. no search party, no funeral i just want to have never existed. i just want to be undone",2
"no, just one shortly before the soap awards judging starts....",3
just what is the point? no one cares about me or loves me. i do not deserve help. i am just done. there is no reason to go on any longer. i just want the pain to stop. i feel like i just keep going even if i cannot. but i am just done. everyone who tries to help me either says that they cannot deal with it a couple weeks later. or they just get angry at me and refuse to help me. what is the point to keep going. nothing makes me happy anymore. i just sit here in my pain and cry. i am just done. i want it to stop. it hurts so much. i feel so alone. i just want to get a bunch of pills and make the pain go away. i am done,6

i believe it s a psychosomatic symptom in my arm but what s it called when you overthink about a limb and hyperfocus on it it feel weird like nothing actually wrong but it s a constant focus because you re thinking about it it s like if you overthink about a word it start to sound weird i hope that make sense i m not really sure how to refocus my attention off of my left hand feeling uncoordinated when it s not but it feel like it is like i m hyper aware my left hand exists and i know that sound so silly but any insight on how to stop this or redirect my thinking i don t feel like being in this rut any longer,2
"i never had anyone to open up to, not until i met my girlfriend. things were going great. the moment i get attached to someone, i start to slowly open up. i trust her. i share my traumas to her and i think it is now overwhelming her. by the time i open up about the people causing my trauma, she gets mad at how obnoxious these certain people are. i do admit that at times, i speak ill to these people. this is the time where i am infuriated and speak whatever that i have been locking up in my mind. unconsciously, bottled up emotions then start to act up. i am a very distant person. once i get attached to someone, its something else. the everyday person that everyone knew well is far from the way i act towards the person i am attached to. i have observed that she is starting to get overwhelmed about the problems i have gone and still going through. despite talking about this and that, i can easily perceive her body language. she checks up on me and wants me to open up. she is the only person i could open up to. i remembered the moment where she told me she is that special for me to finally open up. she was giddy about this idea. i have reminded her that she should not fix me, but i do understand that as my very partner, there is a sense of responsibility to it despite the constant reassurance. i am doing my best to pretend to her that i am having great progress on being genuinely happy. since then i started to keep silent about my personal conflicts however, she could, at times, notice. now here i am in reddit, venting out anonymously. it is my only escape. i can vent out, have temporary peace knowing there is such media platform with users i deeply relate to, be detracted from reality, and avoid putting much burden on my partner. this may sound stupid to some that i would sacrifice my own well-being and dignity to her, but if i had to be honest, i have never felt love being in love and being loved, for a long time. she is the best that has ever happened to me. i value her to my very core. without her, i am certain that i would be dead right now. losing her is my last straw. as long as i have reddit, a place to vent out, there will always be a number of people who will bring me to a whole sense of belonging. hiding from my partner",2
"as a defense mechanism my brain started to erase a lot of memories so everything's foggy.. the basic stuff is childhood abuse and just dealing with the ramifications of that all alone all throughout childhood and the teenage years.. if the kid back then saw this future of himself.... none of this would have been worth it and it never was to begin with, life should have ended for me at 12. eight years later and here we are, just more damaged and closer to ending it all than ever before but it is still the most painful thing to comprehend. i have held on for 8 years and have done so many things and made various amounts of growth to come back from this but each time i have failed relentlessly.. i am stuck in this awful world stuck in this toxic environment... what kind of job could i get to move out? it is too late anyway... i have been searching for over a year and it is clear i am over.. i saw my eyes and there was absolutely no life in either of them... i cannot even lie anymore, i cannot even fake a happy customer service persona... dear god knows i have wished for something terminal for years now and each time i hear about someone dying i wish it was me instead and they could live on just longer before their inevitable demise... i have done so much just to suffer more daily... i regret waking up everyday and choosing life.. the only reason i held off for 8 years was to see if things could be ok, they are not and because i felt god would punish me if i take myself out but this is too cruel for me so maybe eventually down the road when i do take myself out he will understand? he better.. i do not have a choice anymore, i am alone and slowly suffering every fucking day, everyone i am sorry. this is not a pity post so do not treat it as such. it is just my truth of life. and today for some reason i feel especially bad i feel like i am going to throw up but nothings happening. please end my life, god. this is enough. it is enough. please. i do not want to do it myself. please. over 8 years of wanting to be dead",6

"did i have an anxiety attack? i was backing my vehicle into a parking spot as i usually do and i felt panic out of the blue. i felt as if my vehicle wasn't stopping so i slammed the brakes fearing i was about to hit the vehicle behind me. i had a weird feeling rush through my body and then realized i had already come to a complete stop, my vehicle wasn't moving and i was parked normally at a fair distance from the vehicle behind me. the moment felt like a long time but i believe it was only for a second. i consider myself to be a good driver with a clean driving record. i have never been in an accident or have i ever been worried about one. as for the anxiety, i've only ever experienced this while lecturing a large crowd. i have never considered myself as someone who has anxiety.",0
