{"text": "health anxiety when sick hi everyone, i've had issues with gad for the past 10 years, it's something i've learned a lot from, and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. in late november i came down with a cold, which in turn became a sinus infection. i've had semi-noticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy, mainly decreased sense of smell, and having a stuffy nose. during this time, i became paranoid of various fatal diseases, i had a ton of different symptoms, some that can be related to sinus stuff, some anxiety things. i've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit, at one point having almost a full week anxiety free. anyways, do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with ha when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? i am currently paranoid about some kind of bacterial meningitis, which, while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge, i can't get a gp in my city in canada and have to use health clinics. i haven't had any of the super thorough scans, tests, etc. which also makes me a little paranoid, even though i know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. i feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin. i also just wanted to mention that i know this is a positive experience for me, even though it's kind of miserable. i don't want to be overly negative, as i have had my good days during all of this, and i try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary.", "label": "Anxiety", "label_id": 0}

{"text": "mixed episode, first episode of any kind in years hi all, i just went through a mixed episode or at least what i think was a mixed episode, never had one before after being consistently healthy for 4 years. in reflection, i ve realized how much i ve taken my good health for granted. i d forgotten what it was like to feel completely out of control. i think i ve also been in denial in the past that i ever did anything outside of my control during an episode and downplayed it, but this was the kick in the pants that reminded me what it s really like. anyway, in the aftermath there are some things that are still really getting me down pretty sure i m still depressed . this is the first episode i ve had since my son was born. before he was born i expressed to my wife that i was worried about passing bipolar on to him, and i was even more worried about having an episode while i was home alone with him. well, i did end up having to be home alone with him a couple of times and it really terrifies me. at one point i was trying trying to get him into his car seat and he was giving me a really hard time. he wasn t being intentionally difficult, really he was just playing, trying to turn off the dome light. i ended up screaming at him in my driveway while i tried to get him into the seat so i could buckle him in. he started bawling. that was early on in the episode and at that point i hadn t realized yet that i was off in any way, but a couple minutes later i realized i had just done something that i would never, ever, ever normally do. the other times i was with him, i just felt so down that i could barely respond to his needs for food or a diaper change or whatever and definitely couldn t play with him. it was really hard to look at him in the face. he had no idea what was going on and couldn t understand why i couldn t read to him or play with cars when that s what we normally do every day. the one time i tried to read to him i started weeping before i got past the first page. like i said, i was worried that something like this would happen, but i was not at all prepared to handle it, nor was i at all prepared for how it would make me feel. after screaming at him i m worried i m going to become violent. and when i have trouble feeding him, it s just an overwhelming feeling that i can t take care of the kid that depends on me just to survive. i feel completely unable to parent properly and like i am a complete failure as a dad. it has me wondering if my family would be better off without me not necessarily in a suicidal kind of way, more like should i just leave? . in my mind i keep telling myself i m being irrational, but it s pretty hard to believe right now. my wife knows i m feeling down still and last night she asked me if i was going to be ok with him in the morning i get him ready for the day and take him to childcare for the day because she leaves early . i know it s a necessary question, but the fact that it even needs to be asked really cuts deep. anyway, idk what i m really looking for with this post. just needed to get it out.", "label": "Bipolar", "label_id": 1}

{"text": "my bf of 7 months broke up with me simply because he does not know how to love anyone but himself rn, i am so utterly fucking alone. i drop out of high school in grade 9 after being hospitalized so many times and being so ill. i have not really made any friends since and i was supposed to graduate this year if i stayed in school. i watched all my elementary friends and childhood friends throw their caps and meet one of their biggest accomplishments. after i was raped in 2019 i was molested by my brother a month later, that brought up repressed memories and i realize i have been neglected, abused, and touched my entire childhood. my mom will not let me talk about that stuff tho. i was kicked out of 2 group homes and i am in foster care now. i just got released from the psych ward after attempting. idk anymore what did i do to the universe to deserve this at war with the universe", "label": "Suicidal", "label_id": 6}
