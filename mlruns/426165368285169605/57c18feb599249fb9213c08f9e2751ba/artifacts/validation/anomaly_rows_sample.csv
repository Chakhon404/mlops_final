6983,"I do not know how to navigate these feelings, not that its a new feeling by any stretch. I just do not understand how I can go on from being so pleasantly fine to suicidal and self loathing within in minutes and not be able to step out of it. I have been suffering from poor mental health for over 10 years and I am about to turn 26 next week and I feel so ashamed for how serious my negative thoughts are. Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time. It just seems that no matter how many positives come my way they do not last long enough to out weight the negatives. I do not really know what I am looking for I guess I just wanted to say this out loud, or whatever. 0 to 100",Depression
6985,"I am so exhausted of this. Just when I think I can finally rest, just when I think maybe things are starting to settle, another hurdle comes flying at me. This month alone we found out my mum could be dying, my girlfriend left me, my parents revealed that they wanted a divorce, my grandad was hospitalised again and just now my little sister's been rushed to A&amp;E with possible brain damage. If there is a god up there they must fucking hate me. it is like life is trying to get me to kill myself and honestly I think I would be better off dead. I attempted when I was 12 but I was stupid and there was no way I could cut deep enough. Now I am 15 and everything is so much worse than it ever has been and I just cannot hold on much longer -- it is going to take a miracle to get me through this. I feel so alone. I feel like the world hates me and I have no idea what I did wrong to deserve this. I thought I was getting better. I was doing so well and now everything's just come crashing down again. I was thinking about carbon monoxide poisoning but I highly doubt there is any way for me to get that. it is looking like I will overdose but that is unreliable as fuck and surviving sounds like hell so idk. Just got to stick around long enough to make sure my sister's alright. I have already contacted one of my ex's friends to make sure they are looked after when I am gone. I do not think there is long left for me. Sorry. I have posted on this subreddit too many times in the span of a week and that is probably really annoying I just have absolutely no idea what to do anymore. I feel sick. If my sister dies then I really cannot do this anymore. It all hurts. Life is really fucking trying me",Suicidal
6993,"Since I began seeing a therapist 5 months ago I have realised the thought of being happy genuinely terrifies me, and I do not even really know why. I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why",Depression
6996,"I am going to make this short because i hate thinking about it, but long story short, I am getting better after months of medication, therapy, etc. My anxiety is at an all-time low and my antidepressants """"do not allow"""" my mind to wander too much into suicidal thoughts. But i hate it, i hate that I am getting better, i feel embarrassed whenever i catch myself doing something not depressing, like taking a walk, laughing, or doing stuff by my own will. And i feel SO SO selfish, i was given immense support from everyone, my mum has spent so so much time and money on therapists, psychiatrists, pills, etc; she is suffered more than anyone else, even more than me since i seem to enjoy being depressed. she is the happiest she is been in months since she can tell I am in a better mood and she is the only reason i have not ""tried harder"" to get worse, but i do not know how long i can keep it going.Something in me just wants me to maybe stop taking my meds without letting her know, get a new self destructive habit, and go back to the old me that did not leave his bed in days and could not keep a conversation for more than 2 minutes, i really miss it.I am going back to school in a couple of months (i dropped out), i started driving lessons yesterday, I am eating better, sleeping better, I am starting to live and behave like a regular person but i cannot handle it, it makes me feel bad, gross, EMBARRASSED, very embarrassed, and its just a cycle of:I am ok this makes me depressed I am ok again this makes me depressed etc.I do not know what to do, I am not even sure why i am even writing this since I will probably end up ignoring whatever help or advice i get, but i guess i needed to vent, thanks for reading and as always sorry for my english how can i be happy about getting better??",Depression
6998,"Everyone in my schooling system thinks I am autistic but I really faked it so my school work would be easier, I stopped going to school because I do not fit in there with anyone and nobody likes how different I am, I have problems about my body I have a dent on my chest and it makes me so self conscious I cannot do anything that requires me to not wear a shirt or people laugh at me and call me an alien, I have a gf but as of recently she is been loosing connection to me since she has her bestfriend back she does not want to be my bestfriend anymore, I have some friends they are really nice but I do not think they understand me, I think that my Dad hates me because I am not the son that he wanted, I feel like a disappointment to him and my family name because I am ""autistic"" and I have not gone to school for 3 years and I feel weak because I was molested and used when I was 10. I am 17 years old. I do not have a job and I used to be a drug dealer 1 year ago just because I hated going to school, when I was dealing I was addicted to MDMA and Xanax, they have both helped heavily with destroying my views and how I see myself, I have lost all of my happy emotions the only feelings that I feel is sadness and hatred to who I am. I cry almost every day of every hour just because living in my body hurts my soul so much. I do not belong on this planet or in this body. I hope nobody feels the ways that I do it is a shit feeling, I just needed to get this off my chest. I am planning on trying DMT as I have experienced LSD over 30 times but I would just like to try it to see if it changes anything about myself and if it does not change me I do not want to live here anymore. Sorry for huge wall of text Ik a lot of people on this subreddit probably do not actually care about anyone venting you all just care about punctuation and karma but I am doing it anyway I do not feel comfortable on this Earth anymore and I want to die",Suicidal
6999,"I have been talking to someone who I really liked. They were a great person and we really clicked. I told her that I could not do this with her because I am dealing with so much shit in my head that it is not fair to her. She said she wanted to be there for me and I shut her down. I am scared to be depressed around other people now. My poor mental health ruined one relationship and I do not want it to ruin another. I know I am much better now than I was in my previous relationship but I am scared that I might be a horrible person again.I am scared to let anyone be close. I feel like I am just getting by daily and cannot make any real connections anymore. The ability to get close to people is non-existent because I am scared that when they see the real me, they will leave. I am trying to improve but what if I cannot, what if I fall apart again? What if I am the piece of shit suicidal asshole that I was before? I am scared to put anyone through that. I kept making up excuses for why this was not going to work out. Distance, what we wanted, culture, but truthfully I am just fucking scared to be close to someone again. I am scared to be vulnerable. I wish I knew how to not be depressed. It controls my life. I hate it I am pushing people away",Depression
7000,"I have so many stressors in my life, all major things that tear me down. Every day I fight a battle not just with my mental health but with the world. Last night I finally broke. After 33 years of a shit show of a life, I am done. What ultimately triggered this is that my son (7m) with ADHD has been expelled from holiday club. I quit my job Jan 2020 because he was not coping in school and managed to find him a specialist educational provider as well as get him on medication. He did brilliantly! I however, hated being a SAHM and a carer. The loneliness is overwhelming and the fact that I only live to provide food and a clean house to 3 children. So, I started to think about going back to work in my area of specialty which is law. I got a job with a police department. Something for me and something where I will meet other adults without being attached to my children. I got all 3 of my children into a childcare provider and settled them in over months. I have officially been working for less than 2 weeks and my son has regressed back to his bad behaviour. He has been kicked out and now I have to quit my job and go back to being his full time carer. I cannot do this for the next 11 years of his life and possibly beyond that. I do not want to live anymore and there is no help out there for my situation. I can go back on antidepressants, I can go to therapy but none of these things fix my problem that I no longer have any autonomy over my life. I am not a person any more, I am merely a mum with no identity other than that of my children. I find no pleasure in anything and exhaust myself pretending to be happy for the sake of my family. I cannot work, and now as it turns out I cannot even die. I cannot leave behind my children, I am their only parent. I have no control in this life over anything. I now think I am too far gone to ever feel happy again. I want to die. I cannot go back to Groundhog Day",Suicidal
7004,"Not because of death, but because she wanted to get away.I have been depressed for over 10 years and maybe this is the lowest point I have ever been to.The last few days it seems like there is been an invisible force squeezing my chest all the time. I can barely eat. I spent 48 hours with only 1 sandwich in my stomach and after that I have forced myself to eat just to be able to get drunk after I get home from work just so the time goes by quickly and I do not feel this damn pain.She was my last friend. I am completely alone now.Losing people is always a disgrace to me, but ok. I have known this friend for 6 years, and even though we had a few periods without talking, we were doing well for almost 2 years, we never even had a fight until last week.Turns out I was pretty drunk and I ended up insisting on telling her that she did not really care about me and how I was a nobody to her. I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time? I suck at everything and have no friends to have fun with. The ones I had I ruined it. How to deal with the pain of losing someone when you are depressed and that person was one of the pillars of your life?",Depression
7012,"Not a day goes by that I do not break down in tears at some point. 2021 has been the worst. Lost my job, my Aunt, and my stepfather. Now I am I am anxiously awaiting the results from a chest x-ray. My nerves are shot, I am stressed, I am struggling to pay my bills, keep my car on the road, still trying to figure out how I am going to afford the new tires I need while not missing a payment. My credit card has been living about $100 away from maxed for the last few months. I am starting to think everything would just be better if I did have lung cancer, then when I am gone I can stop worrying about money, and happiness, and I will not be such a burden on my family.My wife and I have talked about what is going on, but I have kept a lot of it from her, she sees me crying and does her best to ignore me. I am sure she resents me for being such a useless waste of space. When I am gone she will be able to find someone she can actually be happy with, guilt free.I just, I do not know, I guess I just needed to say it, not expecting advice, or help, just wanted to get some of these ramblings out of my head.

7015,"I have not seen my 7 year old daughter in a couple of months because she moved across the country with her mom, and it has literally been killing me. My mind was telling me our relationship was damaged forever because of this. She is the only bright spot in my entire life. I have just been alternating between drinking and crying, mostly.Today we connected in an online game and had a great time, we are hopefully going to be playing regularly from now on and I will get to talk to her and bond with her through this. it is a pretty basic online game for kids but the first thing she did when she met my avatar was to shrink her own avatar into a little baby and jump on my shoulders like she did when she was a toddler in real life. I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it, so can you, hopefully.

I have no friends or anyone I can talk to , I feel like shit right this now , I do not want anything in life , I do not want to grow old , travel , make friends or whatever the fuck everyone says we should live for . I just want to end it , I wish I died in my sleep , everyday I wake up I feel shock and sadness . I did not choose to be born so why do I have to suffer for people who do not give a fuck about me . oh god !! just kill me nowMusic used to make me feel better ( it was the only thing ) , but now even music does nothing . I cannot tell anyone about how I feel , I feel stuck I cannot take this anymore . My parents think that I am very lazy and stupid so anything I tell them would be because I am m lazy . Like I told my mom n dad about how I do not find anything interest while talking about career and they said it is because I am lazy and stupid that I think too highly of myself and that I am overconfident .They also said that I am useless and would not accomplish anything in life . when actually I have low self-esteem and zero self-confidence . how am I supposed to tell them about my depression that I have got because of neglect and abuse from them in childhood . Like I tell them that I do not feel like doing anything , then they would just say it is because I am lazy , you do not want to do this then you are fucking lazy and stupid ""I just want to die in my sleep , that is the only thing I want .

7029,"// general narcissist venting, feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide. I mean of course they would care. People even care when strangers die. The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing. But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying, and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that. The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying ""what?"" five times in a row because my hearing is going.But the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be. I want to make something of myself but I just, I cannot. I have nothing to put on my resume, I cannot do taxes, there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not! And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know! Why do not I already know basic crap! Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child! Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out? If I brush my teeth, shower, get dressed, and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out! that is it! I cannot do anything else for the day, I am too tired! there is no way I could work or get a job like this! I would burn out after one task and get fired! I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best. I hate that my self esteem is based on other people's approval, but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything. I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc. Of course they would not accept me!! What the hell was I thinking!! What kind of idiot would expect anything different!! Things are not going to get better for the NPD community, not in my life time atleast! Well, maybe that will be another reason to stay alive. Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma, experiencing something I could not. Maybe. When I am in my 80s. And my mom, my poor mom. She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own. Physical therapy, regular therapy, medication, my food, I hate this!! You should not have to take care of me!! You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working!! You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things!! Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so self-centered, and then I can finally let go. And they can all finally live their lives. I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death",Suicidal
7030,"Yeah, this is a question I have been chewing on for a long time. I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, ""I am depressed."" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression's deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is ""depression""? I invite you to share your information and opinions.",Depression

I know from your perspective, maybe you see someone who is hurting, maybe you see someone who needs help.&amp;#x200B;But if you could look beyond my eyes, behind my face.

The ghosts of yesterday yelling out from the corridors of collapsed buildings as the wind whistle through the burned out city. The sun glaring down as dark clouds approach, gusts of wind kicking up large plumes of dust in the distance, heading for the city as lightning begins to strike and bombs begin to drop.&amp;#x200B;Within a moment you are surrounded by flashes of memories all over, all around you and in the winds you can hear the faint voices, some screaming, some crying, some are my own voice filled with regret and sorrow and loss.&amp;#x200B;The flashes are so intense that the images of memories begin to bleed together as you see my life unfold in bits and pieces and for a moment, just a brief second, you see me for who I really am but I whisp away into the surrounding debris just as quick as you can blink.

How much was just your mind trying to put the pieces together? &amp;#x200B;All these questions and doubts, like the particles of dust now drifting further away.

One place will tell me I am too severe to help. And now, this place says what happened was not bad enough. I was not even abused the right way. Even my abuse was done wrong.Which is the SECOND time I have heard it this week, about TWO different types of abuse. And then people have the cheek to ask me why I am so miserable.

7047,"Content warning: Please do not read this post if you are suicidal/prone to suicidal thoughts. I do not want to trigger a negative spiral for anyone else.I am 19M from Turkey. My family history from the maternal side is filled with mental health issues, I have a depressed mother and a suicidal sister who is older than me. I have a very sensitive temperament, am very neurotic and introverted. I am somewhat bright academically (not a genius, but significantly above average), have no hobbies or social life. Ever since the age of 13, I have been severely depressed and isolatedI know maany people have it much harder than me, and I am somewhat in a privileged demographic but I really need to vent without holding back. Living in Turkey is very hard nowadays with the islamo and nationalistic fascist regime, and even if I want to migrate, I will be met with some degree of prejudice because I am a middle easterner. I do not want to leave my country ideally too, but there is no choice other than to strive for an escape. I am not religious, believe life is meaningless. Those are not the reasons behind my depression, though. I do not give a shit about life being meaningless, because I know the brain only seeks happiness and meaning is irrelevant in this case. The problem is, I cannot fulfill my needs and it is destroying meMy lack of social life especially hurts in my relationships with girls. I have gone through many rejections, only to deduce thata) my need for approval is making me unattractiveb) I am not good/attractive/sociable enough for women to take notice of me, want meOf course nobody tells those to my face, they are rather the constant messages I come across reading dating advice blogs, psychological studies on attraction etc. It is even more depressing when dating, intimacy and relationships are portrayed through a lens of competition. And even more depressing that I have no satisfying counter arguments against that. I, too, can see that this is all just a competition; but some of us (me included) are not comfortable admitting. I remember listening to the talks of evolutionary psychologists, how they talk about ""everyone is trying to get the best deal they can"" and ""you may be miserable as an 8, since you lust after 10s but 6s lust after you."" Dating is a market; and I just cannot see how you can be happy or fulfilled unless you are in the 1% as a maleI know suicide, if done right, would be the same as falling asleep, just not to wake up. I know painless ways, and losing hope in ever attaining a fulfilling intimacy just makes me lose interest in living. I have a very painful daily lived experience, and I just wish for the pain to go away but it persists. There is always an unfulfilled need for love, and it is veery hard to fulfill that need. And I do not have the skillset to have it fulfilled (and mind you; I have been trying very hard to be social. My temperament is just too apparent)I am going to wait for my therapy sessions. I just want this painful feeling of isolation and rejection to go away. And it will not. I may decide on killing myself a year later if I feel the same way, and things did not change I am considering suicide",Suicidal
7048,"19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; ""I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!"" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway ""like theirs"", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the ""Pimple King"" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because ""I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything"". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out ""what is the point?"" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please. Please. [LONG POST] Someone kill me please",Depression
7054,"I finally got my depression well under control at the end of this last year. I was managing an exercise routine, cooking lots of healthy and fun meals instead if junk food, spending more quality time with my family, enjoying hobbies again, thriving in school, and managing a self care and hygiene routine (which was always one of my big struggles).I felt like I finally got things under control but I made a big mistake that is sent everything crashing down. I took on extra responsibility and I put too much on my plate. I would rather not elaborate on what it was, but now I feel like I have no time for myself so all of my routine went out the window. I had to do a late withdraw from my last 2 college courses when I had maintained a 3.9 prior.

7061,"Quick background; I suffered social anxiety for most of my 20's and went in and out of depression throughout the years. I am now 31 with no friends, just a boyfriend and all my family who I barely get along with anyway live in another state. Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless. I also went through a horrible year in 2019 where I went numb to something that was happening in my relationship so I would not ""feel"" so much kind of like depersonalization/derealization. Things have gotten better but the numbness has remained. I am not sure how to explain it properly but I do not have anything in my life that is thrilling or exciting to me nor do I care to seek this out. Most people have a vice like shopping, gambling, some sort of sport or activity that gives them a rush. I used to want to travel, I thought maybe that could fill my time or get me excited but even though I have the money and could travel (once out of lockdown), I just do not care for it anymore. it is like, I cannot take the memories when I die so what is the point? I could sit in my lounge room and street view places in Canada for example so once again, what is the point?All I do these days is work, come home, click around on some sites and do it all again the next day. I barely talk to anyone online. My relationship is boring and stale and even though we could spice it up, sometimes I just do not care to. I love my boyfriend but I want someone else to talk to and hang out with. I almost have no reaction to things. If I won a million dollars or even 5, I think my reaction honestly would be ""meh"". Everyone my age is either having kids, married or have successful careers. I have never chased success so I really do not care to climb the career ladder or chase money. None of that matters to me. I am not sure what does. I cannot help but feel as if I am wasting my life away. Sometimes I wish I could have a crazy life. Sometimes I get the urge to do something so out of character to shock myself. To get that thrill. To feel excitement.God, I am so utterly bored with my life. I feel numb about most things. I feel very little excitement or thrill in life.",Depression
7064,"tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night",Depression
7066,"I have posted about it several times, but here goes. 12 months ago I joined a dating website and met a Thai woman. We got on EXTREMELY well. I thought she was the one for me. It later transpired that she had 2 children which she did not tell me about. Odd, but ok. I decided to go with the flow and see whether we could make it work. Shortly after, we got into a relationship.One night I video-called her and she did not reply. She said she was feeling unwell and she would see me tomorrow. When I turned up the next day, she was standoff-ish. I saw her phone on the side so I grabbed it and took a look at her photo album, looking for the photos we would taken a week earlier.I was horrified to see a picture of her in bed with another man. she would cheated on me the night I called her. Even worse, after I confronted her, she told me it was for money. Yes, he would paid my girlfriend to sleep with him. Turns out she was on some kind of dating app and had arranged that behind my back. There were a few other guys she would arranged to see but she did not in the end.She assured me it would not happen again and she had not done it before. Turns out it was all a big fat lie. I found out she was a hooker. By this point we would already given it another go. I would got attached to her and her two. children. I would cooked for them, bought them things - I felt like a part of their family.Anyway, I thought it was all going well and that was behind us, when she cheated. Again. I saw a guy online reviewing her. Yes, REVIEWING her service(s) and he described what happened and how much she charged. I was devastated. I cried buckets of tears.Fast forward a few months and we had given it another go and we were getting along well - when all of a sudden she dumped me.

7067,"I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up. I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

7078,"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",Depression
7080,"Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.",Depression
7085,"I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane. Sorry I have to let some things out",Depression
7091,"This morning I had an appointment with my mental health doctor, along with my social worker. For about 15 minutes we went through the usual conversation about asking how things were with medication, sleep etc.I then decided to be upfront about planning to kill myself after my birthday is done with (3rd of August). They were very shocked by this and asked me why. I just told them that I cannot be bothered anymore and I burst into tears. I cannot remember the last time I cried that much, it was a bit of a relief to let it out.But yeah, needless to say they are really worried about me and they want to try to push psychological therapy to come sooner. They also suggested about putting me on a ward to held keep me safe.I just want to curl up in a ball in a corner and be forgotten about.

I have been in my antidepressants for 6 weeks now and I am not doing okay this past week. Idk if its the circumstances of my life right now or if my medication is not working.. what started this all was me kicking my sister out of my house for disrespect and overstepping boundaries, then basically my mom was supposed to go to rehab so I dedicated 2 days to try and help her get ready.. while I was at her house getting her ready some drama happened and My sister (the one I kicked out) was trying to fight my mom, so I just stepped between them and then my dad comes between me and my sister and yells at me like I was the one instigating. He backed me into a corner almost yelling and cussing at me. He never touched me, but he kept walking towards me so ofc I stepped back. And it just brought back bad memories of my childhood but not a specific one if that makes sense anyway I ended up bringing her to the airport the second day. Well something happened at the airport that was neither of our fault and she said she did not want to go anymore so that upset me and I cried the entire way to her house which was an hour.

7094,"I am 31. I was living my perfect life for 7 years. Prior to that I was depressed and felt lost in life. I was engaged to my soulmate, the one person I felt Id spent my life searching for and could not live without. We had a beautiful 4 bed house in need of work which I was working hard on renovating. I was also at university getting a bachelor of science in CGI having realised finally what I wanted to do with my life. I was a whirlwind of happiness and productivity. We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night. I lay in bed drifting in and out of consciousness until the afternoon, unable to face another day of rotting away in my parents dark spare room. The amount of daylight I waste in bed means I have to spend more of the worst, loneliest hours of the late night unable to sleep.I do not want to die, I just want my old life back, but that is never going to happen.

Whether we talk positive or negative feelings I do not think I have ever truly felt them. I feel nothing. I learned how to act by watching others but never really understood why people would feel e.g. sad, happy or excited. So my life turned into a LARP a long time ago.

For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me "" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go"" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure. I really hated when my dad used to tell me ""You are going to be a doctor so you should know this"". The only thing I know, is that I really really hate you and this hate adds up even more daily.5. I have this new opportunity where I technically can go to another country and go to university there and my parents will not be able to come.

Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them.

They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you.

7125,"I have always been very introverted, but had pockets of close friends growing up. My problem is that I am bad at maintaining friendships and now I have zero friends. I am close to my spouse and kids, but that is it. I do not have social media accounts, I do not text people, and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily, putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on. COVID has not affected me that much since I was a homebody before this all went down. But the lack of job motivation, complete social isolation, and inability to focus makes me wonder if I am in mild depression. I think I might be in the early stages",Depression

I thought I beat it,that I was done with it all. 4 years ago I was diagnosed with ibs. Its been going up and down but lately (I assume because of the heat) my ibs has been horrible. I have to be so careful with what I eat. Otherwise it sets my stomach of. And slowly slowly,my ed started again. Its a sneaky fucking demon. Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

7133,"hello! I am new here, but I have always lurked whenever the ideation sets in the back of my mind and does not let up.i have never gone to a therapist, mostly because i am studying in the same medical field so to speak, and i am scared I would bump into someone i know and spill out why I am there. although we are taught to never judge patients because it is just common courtesy... it feels like it is innate for us to judge, y'know? therapists are people too. we look at people everyday and form this prejudice we have in our heads. i, too, have judged a lot of people before. even those who open up to me like i am doing here now. I am scared that I will be judged by my peers. of older people who would not even dare to listen and understand. because i know, even if they do not tell me. they will think of me as this weak-ass, ungrateful low-life.it is not normal to talk about mental health from where i am, after all.I have never once tried to self-diagnose myself, as i think i cannot look objectively at my own situation. I am aware that what I am doing is self-destructive, that loathing and ruminating all day long preoccupies me when I am supposed to be doing work. work that i do not want to do anymore. work that i want to quit forever.i feel miserable. i have for years now. being in a competitive environment (medical school) that i did not feel strongly about, that i did not feel like i wanted in the first place was soul-crushing at worst, and numbing at best. I have thought of killing myself thousands of times: of jumping from a five-story building, overdosing on ferrous sulfate pills, hanging myself, suffocating myself. sadly, like many things in my life, i never did succeed in doing any one of them. i never even attempted them. it seems that I am scared of the pain it will cost me, of how it will feel. of the possibility that I will survive to live another day with my family knowing that i tried doing it to myself. of the judgement they will give me.in conclusion, i care too much about what others think. of what they will feel. at the expense of myself. and i guess i will be stuck in this limbo indefinitely until i get better. if that time ever comes. thank you for reading. hey, you! hoping that you are just okay. i am in limbo.",Suicidal
7138,"It sucks.I had been suspicious that they would already excluded me when on social media I saw them as a group talking about inside jokes and life updates that everyone but me knew. And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in 2019, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

7145,"reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however, the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time, which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages, normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person, and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years, but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person, and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares, but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards, but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude, or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like",Depression

7171,"Not sure if this is the right place for this or really why I am sharing.I (26 M) have been dealing with depression for as long as I can remember really. The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!",Depression
7175,"I am a 24 yo male. All throughout my life, I feel like I ""peaked"" really early on, and either through self-induced calamity, circumstance, or a combo of both came crashing down. Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself ""settling"" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a ""Introduction to Beer"" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society.

I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams. Well see what happens. Thanks for reading. All the best to you Tanner A difficult life",Depression
7194,"For the last two years I have struggled with hardcore depression, which was only made worse because I feel like my life has been pretty great so why do I feel so bad. Everyone else I know has been through so much and I think they look down on me for it. I dropped out of college during my first year because of it. Two months ago now me and my best friend of 9 years stopped talking for good, and while our relationship was toxic looking back I just feel worthless. I am going back to school this semester, I have been getting into old hobbies, I have a dog which probably saved my life multiple times, and my family is pretty great. But I have no friends whatsoever. I have pushed everyone away or everyone is left me, I feel like I waste my days online and I just do not know what to do. I want to make friends so badly when I go back but she will be there and everyone else who has walked out on me. I am not medicated though I have been but I do not feel like awful as I have a few months ago. But I do feel a void. I do not ever hang out with anyone and I am just lonely. I do not feel like I have anyone to do anything with, and its been making me a nervous wreck. This is mostly just a vent post but does anyone have any tips on how to make friends in college or resocialzing after being depressed for so long? Thanks How to make life worth living?",Suicidal
7195,"you are lonely. I get it. I am too. You might have friends, family, a bf or a gf, people that you love.. but you still feel lonely. Like no one can even understand a tiny bit about you, about what you feel and how you live. it is like you are stuck in your mind, in a thick fog that nobody can enter and that you will not even try to leave. You might have hope. You might not.But tell yourself that : we are thousands and thousands feeling just like you. We all have our little foggy mind of our own and we are all stuck in there and nothing each of us feels is the same as someone else. Pain cannot be compared. We all feel it differently.So even when you are alone. Even when there is no hope. Think about all the other. Who are keeping this fog at bay as hard as they can. Think about us who are struggling to survive. Thousands of us are gone.. but even more even still fight it. So do not let go. We might not be together, but we are all linked somehow.you are not alone. you are not alone. Even if you are alone.",Depression
7201,"Not necessarily in this community, although I have seen it here before, but just in general. Someone will post in or speak about how they overcame their suicidal urges and their depression in groups of people who are all depressed and suicidal; take all the congratulations and ""I am proud of you""'s but never explain how the achieved it or give advice or even RESPOND to people asking them how they did it.Now I know nobody is entitled to anyones story, but when you dangle it in front of people who could reall use its faces, it just feels so cruel yknow? Like someone from a poor neighborhood returning to their home rich and successful and they never tell their old friends and fanily or even just people in the neighborhood who NEED it how they did it. They just stand around in the neighborhood to be admired and praised and when someone asks them how they got to that point they either ignore them or give them that same half assed vauge ""it gets better"" answer. Its good that you overcame your illness. Its good that you decided to not kill yourself or your attempt failed and you decided to live and work on getting better. Congratulations. But PLEASE if you are going to share give us SOMETHING to look forward to. Even if its specific just give us ANYTHING. do not gloat to people in your old situation about how much better you are doing and keep the methods you used a secret. Meds? Love? Therapy? Religion? A fucking hobby??? Give us something to use.One of the few things that pushes me closer to ending it is being so *close* to getting advice, real advice from someone who actually understands, on how I can save myself; and then having that information withheld. And again, I am not entitled to anyones story and nobody is obligated to tell strangers on the internet about their very personal battle; but shit if you are going to brag about how you became happy to a bunch of depressed people at least tell us how.

7207,"IDK if this is the right sub. to post this but its one of the few that I think will actually accept a post like this and something I need to get off my chest.&amp;#x200B;Anyway, I am 23 years old and have Aspergers (high functioning Autism). When I went to college (started ""real life"") is really where my life started to fall apart. In general, from speaking to others this is a pretty common occurence for most people on the spectrum and other developmental disorders as such. &amp;#x200B;In realizing how much it impacted me, I certainly went through the stages of grief. Now I feel I am at the phase of acceptance in that I realize that there is no magic cure and its something I will have to live with. That being said, I do not side with the general Aspie community it seems with the opinion that the development of pre-natal scanning for Autism for aborting is obscene and wrong. Not only that, but I strongly encourage it. I do not think it should be required to abort them but I do certainly think that REAL education of what its like raising a kid with Aspergers/Autism is like as well as the obstacles they face. &amp;#x200B;At the end of the day, there are VERY few parents who I think can properly and effectively parent a child with it. I even tell my parents that I think you are good parents but not good parents for me (AKA somebody with Autism/Aspergers) but that I do not blame them for it because it should not be expected of them. I do not think the parents should be stigmatized for it but at the same time its not fair to the kid.&amp;#x200B;Not to mention the world in general is admittedly not structured for those on the spectrum. I guess you could argue that its possible for some to adapt but at the end of the day I do not really see the point of knowingly having a child who you know ahead of time is going to immensely struggle to blend in society (hence why I encourage abortion in most cases). &amp;#x200B;A commonly asked question I see is why do we only ever see children with developmental conditions advertised/in media. At the end of the day, its because adulthood is almost always bleak. ""Institutions"" are still a VERY real thing. Lower functioning Autism, Down Syndrome, mentally retarded, etc. kids are still very much sent off when their parents no longer can/feel like taking care of them. I know the common belief in society is that the handling of mental illness until recently was very poor and everybody was just institutionalized, well, its the same thing now. The only difference is that they can live their childhood at home and with their peers before being sent off. &amp;#x200B;Conditions like Aspergers are not much less bleak. Most are able enough to not be sent to an institution but most companies outright refuse to hire those on the spectrum, the unemployment rate is ridiculously high, many jobs require skills Aspies do not naturally have. Most end up in poorly paid jobs reserved for those with ""disabilities"" or doing something else of little respect. I am actually personally looking into doing sex work.&amp;#x200B;I certainly do not see myself committing suicide at this point (although if assisted suicide becomes available I would take it). Although I think a real part of accepting my condition is realizing that I am not all that special and can now more clearly see and accept the fact that Aspergers/Autism just does not work. I will say that one benefit (there are not many) is I do think I am a bit less judgemental after realizing how Aspergers/Autism impacts me. I can now more clearly see that jobs like sex work are no less respectable than any other company and have more respect for those workers and realizing that there is no shame in what they are doing. I feel like part of the acceptance stage (final step in stage of grief) should be admittance to want of death",Suicidal

It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at ER &amp; then passed away in my husband &amp; Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him (and after 4 miscarriages) that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him &amp; I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old, yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat, I am always tired, I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder &amp; addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out, I got my shit together, my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar. I was so excited to take him to the beach, I bought a swimsuit that was several sizes too big so he could wear it in the summer. Its in his closet with the tags still.I sleep with his onesies in our king size bed. I wish it was him instead . I do not know why I am posting this, I have had Reddit for a long time and have never made a real post. Maybe I am looking for people to relate to or maybe this is a cry for help.

7229,"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse. I have never felt more alone and scared in my life, I think about suicide every minute, and I have come up with a plan. I am 23 with no college degree, barely any work history, with no hope for an actual future. I have lost the one person I could got to about anything, because I cannot burden my mom with everything she is going through. I see a therapist every week and it has been zero help. She recommended a residential therapy program for a month, which I feel like is worth a try but the problem is I cannot leave my mom. She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her.

Even spoke to someone days before it supply ran out. But in the end it was not refilled. Mind you I had not had an appointment since maybe January as I missed my last telephone appointment sometime in spring I believe. I was on the max dose of the prescription , I had been on this since the end of 2017 although my dose was not maxed out till around the start of 2019 if I recall correctly. I had been skipping doses here and there but never more than 2 days at a time sometimes I would forget if I had taken my dose for the day and most times I elected not to take said possible missed dose for that day in the event that I did take it. So I am wondering what to expect in the coming weeks or months. Mind you I have a lot of other mental impairments aside from severe depression and bipolar. Some I do not even know anything about. I am currently not sleeping too much , it is a lot more difficult to fall asleep now. I am having brain shocks and what not often. I feel like I used to prior to taking this medication. Extreme tiredness , slurring my words often , not feeling alive at all.

This is a lot to read and I am sure I confused anyone who has made it this far. But I am hopeful to get some kind of response.

7238,"I have been close to my friend for four years, in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own. We got in a lot of fights, mostly about respecting each other, since he never respected me. I made mistakes in the friendships, he made some overly bad mistakes. I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end. Throughout the friendship, I helped him so much, paid for so much, bought him things to make him happy, and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long, just so he could be happy. So many things, because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life, and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship. Fast forward near our graduation, he gave me covid-19, and throughout covid 19, my dad passed away when I got symptoms, and I had to be locked in a small room throughout, and I never got to see my dad in his last moments/ when he passed. I stood in a room shaking, and that same idea torment's my soul, and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me. When I had covid, he would not let me tell any of our friends, he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him, and others. I was threatened, and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition. The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends, and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him. Throughout this incident, a month later he ended up cutting me off for reason's that I regret, but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me, and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother, and forced it upon me and him, and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls. At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons, lies were being told. In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself, and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me. Now it continues that I am losing my other friends, I have fallen into depression, and he is slowly making everyone hate me. The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself, but nothing has gone good. Every single week something worse happens, and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore. I do not want to go throughout life, my life is over, my dad is gone, and everything is just garbage.

7248,"When I was younger, in my childhood, I had self worth, I still had anxiety, but I felt like I was the best at everything. I was a ""gifted"" child and did well in school, in fact my only main source of anxiety was if my crush liked me back. Either way I felt special and unique. I have had worrying behavior before where I would cut myself with school scissors and even younger as a toddler, I would bang my head against the wall or floor. Still. Those things were rare of me though maybe I should I have taken it as a sign of things to come. In middle school I was anxious but I still felt nice and special. 9th grade was when things changed though, I started to get bullied which made me reevaluate myself, I started seeing myself in a negative light, and the only way I coped was sleep or being in a constant state of self loathing. There were times I made threats to the students that were bullying me, but instead of thinking it was wrong, I doubted my capabilities to go through with the threat. After 9th grade I felt better going to another high school, I was not getting bullied, and even though I was not quickly making friends, people still let me hang around them or sit at their table. It was nice. I met my ex boyfriend not too long after and we stayed together for 3 years. He ended up leaving me during my first semester of college. I felt sad about it, but having been in a relationship for 3 years gave me a false sense of security that finding another relationship might be easy. I was quite wrong. Not only that but I started to realize many people were better than me and were skilled at something while I realized I was not. I was quite literally not good at anything or at least not good enough. However, this world requires you to contribute something to it. I could not. The former gifted child felt lied to. That I could do anything and I had great potential. It bothered me a lot. I did not feel like I could conquer anything like I used to. Instead, I was smacked in the face with the truth that I was not special and my best was not good enough. Through this period people kept telling me to keep trying and I eventually will get good. I did not see any improvement, in some areas I felt like I was getting worse. Right now I am stuck with the feeling of inferiority and suicidal thoughts. I am not quite doing anything for this world, in a way I feel like I am taking up space that could be used for a much more skilled and intelligent individual. Recently I looked through documents of tests that were done when I was younger in elementary school. I found that I lacked critical thinking skills and had a language disorder as well as anxiety. I thought my IQ may have been better but I tested below average for verbal iq and only slightly above average for non verbal with the highest in calculating. Right now I am not sure how to move forward... but I am too scared to kill myself. I have never been good enough. .",Suicidal

7253,"I am a 15 year old kid and I have been struggling with what i believe is depression. I have so many trust issues with relationships and friendships, i hate the way my body looks even though I am working out to try and fix it but sometimes it just feels futile. My friends hate me, the reason i think this is because my one friend group they all make fun of me, call me unfunny, annoying, and one dude in there always call me an emo depressed kid who should just kill himself. I really only have my mom, and a couple of friends but i feel so embarrassed to tell them how i feel. My dad is a horrible father and contributes to how lonely and out of place i feel. And a couple weeks ago i went to my friends birthday party and me, him, and his friends smoked weed and it was the first time for me and for once in my life i actually felt something. I have been craving that high ever since but idk who i should ask to buy edibles off of, or if i should even do it. i have not tried self harm nor do i want to because i know once i go down that road ill cross the line and i do not know if ill be able to come back from that.

Once my great grandmother, pop, and what not die and my current friends one at lunch leave who will I have? My mom who keeps putting me down and screaming at me for the slightest inconvenience to her? My dad who I barely see? My little siblings and cousins? I do not care if they will miss me, in enough time they will forget me like everyone else does.the only people who truly care talk about me behind my back, I have no mental stability, I am self conscious to the point of it being crippling, I have no skills or knowledge on how to get a job nor a reliable path I can take for a career.

7260,"I got really ""triggered"" today (I do not know if that is the right word, I guess I just mean extremely emotionally disturbed) by an article I read about how bad violence gets in prisons. How can people do such horrible things, and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all, it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soul-shattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through, and everytime I get ""triggered"" like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me. I do not know how to get it out of my head other than to off myself. There is so much unimaginable suffering (TW violence, sexual assault, animal abuse)",Depression
7261,"Its been around a month since I have had a depressive episode and its back again. The crying every night, the thinking about my past (causing me to lack sleep), getting you look tired looks from family and friends who see me, people checking in on me because they know something is wrong even though I try so hard to minimize it and keep it under wraps. I just have no clue what to do anymore. My parents would be depressed if I were gone and my alcoholic sister would never even be able to fully understand it, who knows if she would even find out. After a while though everyone would heal and life would continue on. Maybe one or two people would visit my grave, but after then the trips would become farther and farther away until I am just another headstone. Who knows, would I even get a grave? that is expensive and I would not want my parents to have to pay for that. is not that crazy? We die and then we have to pay for dying. Fucked up. And even if I stay alive. Will anyone ever love me? When I was little I dreamed of being a single mom because I thought that it was more realistic than marriage.

7267,"I often feel the only way to make people take my depression and possible underlying causes seriously is to actually kill myself. Especially family, who I feel are supportive in some ways but downplay my depression. They do not take it seriosuly when I say I cannot handle work and life. A certain family member is the worst- stating before that I just get a little down sometimes (that phrase still makes me want to punch a wall)or that he notices others inc himself feeling depressed in winter or that he had trouble keeping a job when he was younger. He gives terrible advice that just makes me angry do not feel you cannot take a vacation. That does not solve the problem of the actual job! I am sick of being minimized.I feel (and maybe I am wrong) its just minimizing my condition. I mean hes supportive in other ways. But I am still angry and I feel killing myself is the only way to win the argument I feel, having failed at anything in life the only I can have the final word or any control is to kill my self - successfully. A failed attempt will only make me more of a failure. I mean I know there has to be a better way to deal with this I just do not know how. Confrontation will not help, Ill just sound more desperate. Staying my true feelings about everything to everyone will not help Ill just embarrass and maybe isolate myself more. I can discuss with a counsellor but that often just feels like talking. Its not an solution its not even leading to one. People only take action, especially irreversible violent action, seriously.

But my number one problem is work. I cannot help my mom because of my mental health, and it feels so damn disabling. Its been about 7+ jobs where ill go through this whole process, go the first day or maybe not even show up to the interview and never go back. Why? I do not know, I feel afraid socially and the thoughts of the 8 hours of work drains me, back to back days on top of it. But I do not understand why I cannot be like other people and just go and get it over with. I cannot do that, it feels like I would rather die before go in again, and that is how I feel right now, 12 hours before my second ever shift at a new job.

7296,"It is almost time for my final tour. It kind of reminds of when I inititially tried to do this vacation almost 18 months ago. I was supposed to go on this trip in March of 2020. I was to leave on a Saturday, and on Friday I had to cancel because everything, including the hotels shut down. I had to cancel the day before my trip, actually day of, as I was on the phone for that long trying to cancel and recoup everything. Now, here I am, about to head on the tour I was supposed to have, and 2 days before I am about to leave, all mandates are back on. I am not against this at all. It is just funny, that the eve I am about to go again, and all things are on the verge of being cancelled. I waited till everything opened, to make sure I could do everything, and what do I get for my patience. The eve before I am to go, mandates back on.I think I said this in the first post, but regardless of whether this trip happens or not, I am killing myself. And if I cannot go, it makes sense, since it will be exactly how my entire life has been, with dissapointment. If I can go, I guess I can just sit in my hotel room alot. Go out get food, to bring back to my room, and eat it cold. Makes sense actually. Fits my life.So close, but never quite there. If I go, if I do not, by the end of August, I would say read my obituary, but there will not be one, or if there is, it will just be, he lived... and now he is not. I cannot begin to tell you how angry, unhappy and frustrated this news makes me. Maybe a good time would get me out of my funk, bit its just more dissapointment. Think I would be used to it by now.

My arms, legs, toes, fingertips. Everything on me feels empty, and it is a weird and uncomfortable sensation. I am almost tingling, but not good tingling, tingling that is excruciating.

I want to explain them so hard and with that rage , you know , so that they feel it ig , that let me be what I want and instead of scolding me everyday , shouting and wasting your time , just do not force me to change my personality. I can understand why they want to do that , people here , all neighbours , judge a lot, and they are going to make your life harder in a society if you are not what they wanted, and I have to pretend , which is not enough and always end up getting teased by those extroverts. I want to tell them idgaf about you , I do not want to talk to you, but I cannot.Most of the times especially at the night when I am about to sleep, I start reviewing my day and explain to myself and correct what mistakes people around me made , how stupidly wrong they were , it is not like I am correct, but I do not even have a chance of debate and those people are always wrong. Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything. I seriously forget words , it is like blood instead of rushing to my brain, is rushing to my legs and arms and asking me for flight than fight.

My parents think I am lazy, good for nothing and will probably kick me out on the streets soon.My head literally hurts, I often feel a tight knit in my chest and I have lost my appetite for a few months.

That for everything I try to do to actually be useful to others almost always seems to backfire one way or another, like a constant reminder that I am always going to be worthless, that it is the punishment I deserve for even being born.That it is my own fault for even trying in the first place. Or my own fault for not being able to ignore the pain in my back and knees more so I could push myself to just fucking do better. I mean why should I care if I ruin my body now? I barely expected myself to make it this far, to live this long. I mean eventually even cowardice will reach its own breaking point I imagine.

I just wish my death would not be as much of a burden as my life has been.How nice it would be to just pop away, to erase my debts and traces of my life as if I was never here to begin with. I know so many people fear the very idea of the end. But at this point I am either numb to the aspect of it or almost in a way dream of that time finally coming. I mean I could remember a time dreaming of what it might be like to finally be better, to find the joy and wonders of life--which I mean I can appreciate and all, but there is also this sort of tarnish that constantly smudges everything when you have to live like this. That nothing can ever be good for too long. That things that bring you down have to roll over again and again until you just stop fighting and just become the punching bag that everything seems to zero in on. And maybe that is what the idea of death inviting in it is own way. That once you enter that dark abyss there just is not anything anymore. No terrible things to constantly remind you of how worthless you are, no good things that always perks up that joy and hope no matter how in vain you know it is, just waiting for them to be ripped away again like they always are.Just a peaceful empty where I can fade away into nothing, where I can stop being a burden to everyone around me.

Growing up we were abused. When he would be the one on the receiving end of the abuse it always broke me to see my big, strong, charismatic, athletic brother have such a deep sadness but the kind you can only recognize if you have felt the same way.

I adore my brother while on the other hand I have made the decision to forgive our mother and that is something that will always put a strain on our relationship. We went from being so so close to now me having a 2.5y/o he is never even met even though I have invited him many times. He also agreed to come meet her on her birthday and canceled 20min before he was supposed to be here. He told me that the only way he feels like he can be okay is to be independent and prove to himself he does not need anyone.

7323,"I feel like I have always had one sided friendships. like I am always the one who puts in all the work. And it sucks because it used to hurt less. When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my ""hometown"" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece's room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst. I do not even try anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed. If you are reading this, know that I do not want to die. I do not want to stop living. my death would be too painful to people I care about. I would never do that to them. but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish, I would ask to have never been born. obviously, there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now.

It seems like too much of a mess and too much effort for something that will not even last. I feel like i have already tried so many times to be happy, and none of them worked. Even when I have people that love me, friends, hobbies, life still seemed so shit. Is this just it? At some point i just stopped attempting and accepted that I will never be happy with my life. The only way i see an end to this is suicide, but I am just too scared to do that either. I also know that i will hurt some people if i do die, and in the end, i just feel like I am trapped here with nowhere to go. It makes it all the more frustrating that i hate being here but i cannot just kill myself . I feel like i do not even want to be happy anymore.

They loose more respect for me as the days go by. They say everything is fine but i know they are just trying to be polite. I am a bum. they all no it and none of them like to be around me. I forget important things about their life and barely take care of them or show them love. I have been in a spiral for a while and its heading its peak. The only thing i can do on this fucking earth now is to take care of my mom try to get a good job to support her and that is the only reason I am still here. I am disorganzied, distracted, lazy.

They will not have to look at me being a dissapointment everyday. try to rely on me as family should and me fail everytime, be a burden to them. I cannot keep doing this to them.

7333,"This evening, like 2 hours ago, I planned my suicide. I planned where I was going to do it, and a few days ago I planned the day that i was going to do it (this friday). But almost 30 minutes ago after I washed my face and cleaned my hair, i feel amazing about myself. This happens EVERY DAY. I get really suicidal because I loose my plans for the future, and because I am very self conscious about my looks, to the point where I have tried to cut my nose to make it look better (but failed). This lasts for about 90 percent of the day, but then at around 10 percent of the day (usually occurring at night) I feel like I am beautifal and that I feel amazing about myself (but I still do not see my future for myself as I lost most of my hopes and hobbies but that does not make me feel any less worst during those times of the day). I have been diagnosed with depression before, but I lied to my therapist because I did not want to get in trouble with my parents and told her I was ok, so in her and my parents eyes it looks to me that I am getting a ton better, (they think I am doing better because I get hella good grades and the best grades out of all my siblings despite having depression) but I am not. My suicidal tendencies have gotten worst this month, and this month I have gotten EXTREME low self esteem from seeing others on social media. Does anyone know what is going on?

7336,"I have never really felt like I belonged or that anyone really cared about me. My family is very bad at showing affection, praise or even attention. As a child, my parents were too busy working and raising my younger siblings to give me the attention I needed. Fast forward and all my high school friends abandoned me for their significant others. I was the only one who was not in a relationship. there is a reason I do not talk to them anymore. When I turned 21, I met my future wife. We dated for 5 years before I proposed. We married and after 3 years, she wanted out. She lost her attraction to me was her reasoning. She left me in our home and she took our child with her. The only living creature that ever gave me unconditional love was my dog. She was really my only friend the year after my child was born. My wife withheld affection and intimacy from me when I asked for it. I had to put my dog to sleep because she had an inoperable tumor on her heart. After that, I had no one and its where I am today. I am fearful that when I start dating again, I am going be afraid of rejection or possible abandonment. Trust is very hard to come by for me and I am socially anxious to begin with. I just feel so worthless and beat down by life. I guess even when everyone around you knows how severe your depression is, they do not care enough to try and help.

7340,"I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this. Every time I hear about sex i just think Yep, another person experiencing what Ill never get to experience. Everything and anything related to sex makes me want to kill myself.",Depression
7344,"Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 24/7. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However, I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues, but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression, so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am, but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing (haha) essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.",Depression

I have heard other people share similar stories. Also, I am sexually active with my girlfriend and I cannot cum - we have had sex probably like twice a week, for the last 2 months, and I have finished exactly 1 time. Its horrible.

I had active social life and would do things without thinking going parties, nights out, friends etc.Of course lockdown now but this been a few years.In early 20s I notice my hair falling out. I started using sun beds and tanning without suncream because I thought it I go bald I need look dark as white people look sick when bald.My idea was to burn my skin so it is permanently dark.Fast forward a few years not only is my once luxiourios long thick hair half disappeared my face looks like a burns victim. I stopped the sun bathing due to this this my skin is white anyway the irony but all saggy and scarred qnd aged. Fant even hide it with my long hair as I have no long hair so my face is fully visible now. So Combine this with my thin receding hair I have gone from looking like a boy band teen to I am going to some hideous creature.When we people take pics when I have to go out work or family etc restarts they always upload pics without me. The ones with me do not go on Facebook etc...it is obvious they do not want my fuked up face on social media and I do not blame them.Now the issue as a result before covid I avoid everything. No spontaneous life anymore. Going out for 2 or 3 days in a row. Random parties or nights out. I just became a recluse.I need to always carry or wear a hat i couosnt dare sleep over some place now. I live in constant fear over my looks.I hoped lockdown would make me feel less missing out as everyone same boat and time to avoid sun use creams fix my skin improve diet hope hair improve.But over 18 months my hair is worse and face not look any better.Well nobody is going out anyway with covid round here but I still feel my life is fuked because I had it all.I looked normal and had social fun life now I am just constant obsessing and looking mirror qns almost crying.I cannot even look mirror anymore to soul destroying only in dim lights.I cannot believe only some years ago my skin was perfect and hair amazing long.Of course hair loss can happen but I see people grandparents with still nice skin so that is all my stupid fault qnd cannot improve it.Depresses me every day.I eat well workout in good shape I gueas etc but all seems pointless Is it stupid to be suicidal due to appearance",Suicidal

7354,"So I posted to a group where me and my friends chat about how if I was gone for a long period without talking (2 weeks since I am quite active there) that I was probably dead. The reason being my parents want us to move to the country side with no internet beacause they are conspiracy theorists and such and the internet is basically my only support. And I honestly could not talk to them about my problems and they no way would not move to the country side even if I pleaded on my knees and I honestly do not think I would want to live anymore at that pointI have anger issues and when I get quite angry I have the urge to take a knife and stab myself in the throat and I am quite open about this to my family of course they take it as a joke a little goof a gag a punchline. So they never take it seriously to be honest if we did move I would probably stab myself to death or at least drown myself I could not stand moving so far away from my dreams ambitions and friends like that and at that point I do not see a reason to live my life is already screwed up so I do not see a reason to stay at that point So back to my friends I told them straight up if I am gone for 2 weeks no talking, that I probably killed myself. I wanted them to know this since I did not like the idea of them never knowing what happened to me since I know if i was in they are position that I would want to know why someone so active just stopped posting and I left for bed I came back tomorrow and only one of them said anything out of the 4 friends 1 of them ignored me (maybe did not see the message but be were never all that close) and the other 2 had not posted so I assume they were offline The one that responded did not know how to react and when I checked recently they were panicking asking if anyone saw me online and that they were worried about me and I do not know how to respond staying silent would be a dick move I do not want to make them upset Y'know but at the same time I do not know what to say I cannot promise that I will not kill myself it is the truth I would buy do not like seeing the upset but I do not want them to live on thinking I am okay I am honestly confused I am only 13 and I honestly cannot think of what to say to them.

7361,"How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation. Right now I feel like I have lost the man who was on my side for the biggest part of my life. How I lost my dad",Depression
7364,"Before I start, I promise I will show this and my other suicide notes to my therapist whenever I see them. I have been suffering from mental health illnesses for years (was diagnosed 6 years ago). I hate it. I genuinely hate it. I have to take meds to boost serotonin levels (store-bought serotonin as I call them). On my birthday in June, I told myself I will end things an year from then (provided things do not get better). I am 24 and am yet to do achieve anything significant (unlike my parents, siblings, close friends and connections on LinkedIn). Turning 24 recently is really hitting me hard. I graduated university at 21 and have done internships (a local bank, a Big 4 firm consulting firm and startups) every now and then. My last paid internship ended before the summer of 2020. I am yet to secure a full-time paid job since, unlike my peers who are pretty successful in the corporate world (i.e. they are getting promoted or moving to international offices say London, UK). But, then, there is me. I have wasted the last 3 years of my life. I could have learnt a new language. I could have learnt new software (say PowerBI). I could have been studying towards a professional qualification (say CFA, CAPM etc.). I could have lost weight and gained muscle. My ex left me at 21 because of me being suicidal and unstable back then. But, my untreated mental illnesses do not let me too. I messed up the final two years at university (relative to my first year performance which was stellar). At all of my internships, I was extremely slow with tasks i.e. making PPT slides, replying to emails (I believe I have undiagnosed psychomotor retardation). In my daily life, I avoid doing a lot of chores, for instance, doing the dishes, folding my laundry, cooking, reading a book. It takes me 30ish minutes to do the dishes (something that would take my sibling 15 minutes). It takes me 7 minutes to read a page of a novel. Taking that into account, it would take me 2 months to finish a 300 page novel. Because of how slow I am, I have gotten very dumb too (I struggle with basic mental maths and avoid doing things that require a lot of brain power). I am not even sure if therapy would help me. I am scared of entering the corporate world or pursuing a masters. Because of how slow and dumb I am and how stressed I get in pressured situations. I point fingers towards my untreated mental illnesses. At times, I wish I had cancer or something similar to show people around me that I was actually struggling. Even though, I told myself I will commit suicide a day after my birthday next year in June. If things do not get better (i.e. I do not land a full-time job and not be as slow as I am today). However, I feel like ending things this Saturday. My method of suicide would be jumping off a bridge (near a major public hospital) and getting hit by an incoming vehicle once I jump. Or, I will overdose on my meds. But, very likely, that will be next June. Whenever I hear of people dying on the news or from other sources, I say ""Lucky them. I wish it was me instead of them."" I always pray I die in my sleep. But, here, I fucking am. I know things will not get better (there is too many things to work on and fix). I am better off dying, either naturally or via suicide. I am currently working on launching a non-profit startup, centered around mental health. In that case, it will further motivate everyone involved in case I end up killing myself. Turning 24 has really hit me. It feels like I have run out of time to achieve things......it is too hard to turn things around. If you have made it this far, I appreciate you reading of my struggles and my suicidal thoughts. I have had enough (In tears as I type this)",Suicidal

Not only that, I do not even really know what to do to get better. Or if I want to get better in the first place. My biggest problem, that I am Non-binary, is not even fixable. Outcast amongst outcasts, it is got to be the most hated minority since even other trans people hate on us. Not to mention other LGBT people and obviously everyone else. I read that like 87% of people would not even date a trans person, so I am assuming the numbers even higher for nonbinary people. Which makes everything very isolating. There is no way in the world I could even date in my current state, but even if I could I would never find anyone nearby. I thought the first step would be going to therapy, but that is over. I looked up the ones that take my insurance and there is like 4 in this area, 0 of which offer in person. And then even if we pretend everything else was solved, I still have no way to support myself. No way I can work because everything makes me want to kill myself, no way to go back to school because I am poor. No interests or passions at all besides making art.

Had pretty much everything going for me coming out of HS, lots of friends, a girlfriend who loved me, good family life, confidence etc. Things pretty much started to go down hill when I started college out of state. Gf broke up due to distance, she went to a different school. This pretty much sent me into a depression, have not gotten out of it. Did some of the right things, joined a fraternity, went out a good amount. Just never really developed a close group of friends at my new school, just kind acquaintances who came and went. Long story short developed a drug and alcohol problem and slowly but surely have become a loner. Most people I either got sick of my bs or just have moved on to their new lives now and most of my class has graduated. Have about 2-3 people I would consider friends, both at home and in school. Now I am a 22 year old sophomore.Troubles with the law and an accidental overdose in the past 2 years have just made things worse both mentally and in my day to day life. On probation, so going out to bars and socializing is pretty much out of the picture (I go to a party/sports school in a s town so that pretty much makes up 95% of the social life ) Been sober for 8 months and honestly just feel worse from when I had a drug problem. At least then I had confidence and the motivation to go out and at least make the effort to improve my life. Now I just sit in my apartment/room all day. do not have motivation to try and make new friends because of how many times I have failed at it and a lack of self esteem. Tried countless therapists and different antidepressants. Just feel stuck, and I do not know what to do anymore. Just going through the motions. Life keeps getting worse",Depression
7381,"I just had surgery for a potentially serious type of cancer. I have been in a good mood, except for the first week when I was told the diagnosis. I made the mistake of consulting Dr. Google and it sent me into anxiety.I had serious bouts of depression 30 years ago and a few bouts since then. Six hospitalizations, lots of med changes, stress, career disasters, relationship disasters, and substance abuse (alcohol).I have been sober for many decades, got to retire at 50, have no financial worries. Never got married and that one really bothers me some times. I was successful, high average attractive, sales for big corporations so had money. As a friend of mine likes to say, ""Women are not looking for guys like us"", (guys with morbid depression). God, I had a couple women in my mid twenties that were so gorgeous and smart as hell, but my behavior drove them off or I ditched them for a bottle.Anyways, I am in post recovery, have some post surgical aches and still waiting to hear pathology. I got sort of sad and moody this week. I think I will be in good shape, I was Stage II with something you do not want to go Stage III. Actually I could be III because the pathology is not back yet. I stopped doing things I like to do, painting, going out into the forests, fly fishing. I bought a new carbon fiber canoe a month ago, you can pick up with your pinky. I have not set that boat in a lake or river yet this summer. I sometimes think my life was a bust, I die without kids or a partner, what was the point?Just venting, sure things will get better.

I feel like I just lost a huge part of myself. And I am not looking for a job and cannot get any interviews. I have applied to 8-10 jobs and was told 6 or 7 times I was not what they were looking without even an interview. I do not know what to do. My current job is a work study job that requires me to be a student. My last day is Friday . My sister is about to move to college. I am so beyond proud but it scares me because I will not see her every day. I know they say call or FaceTime but it is not the same. My brother is actively trying to move out. I am the oldest sibling yet I still live at home. I cannot drive. I have so little work experience that no one wants to hire me. I feel pathetic, alone, lost, scared, depressed, worthless.

7390,"I am a 17 yo guy and I have been struggling with depression, derealization and paranoia ever since I was 12. On top of that I now have GAD.I have been wanting to kill myself since I was 12 because at 12 yo I started having episodes of derealization caused by the paranoia that everything is a dream or fake.I have somewhat gotten over that, but all that has been replaced by depression and anxiety which caused me to fail 2 years of school. I hate myself for letting that happen.When school is on, every day I think of suicide and have really bad suicidal depressive mental breakdowns every night.Right now it is summer break, but I cannot take all that pressure again. Sadly, dropping out is not an option for me.I also hate myself because of my height. I am only 5'8/172cm tall and I live in a country where the male average height is 5'11/182cm. That makes me feel really inferior, weak and pathetic because most guys I know are taller than me.I think I feel bad about my height because I am secretly competitive so I have been feeling my whole life like growing taller is a competition.Just for the record, I am already in therapy and on antipsychotics and antidepressants.

Now, just turning 30 I have dropped out of college/university twice and only have a diploma in music production which makes me extremely overwhelmed and anxious anytime I even attempt to make anything. I was in Human resources last year and missed one course on my final semester so i never graduated. I hated the curriculum anyways... bunch of cucklord social justice bs... I am kind of at the end of my ropes now though. I am 30 years old and feel like a huge loser. I moved back in with my parents who are constantly trying to get me to move out again and telling me to go take school or another program that i have no idea if I should take or not. Life is slowly falling apart around me. My parents are getting older and life feels like it is getting worse every day. I am in Canada and cannot even buy a gun to die. Part of me does not want to die because I do not want to fuck up everyone else's lives around me but nothing seems to help me get better. I am starting to lose faith in myself and my ability to move forward. The only friends who i occasionally talk to drink alcohol all day and smoke weed/play video games. They are complete losers. I used to do shit like this but I do not want to do this shit anymore. I feel like I have no idea how to get better. I am tired and exhausted and things just are not enjoyable. Medication also does not seem to work for me. I get bad anxiety on antidepressants and yea... I also used to experiment with a lot of mdma and smoke a ton of pot over 5 -10 years ago when i was first in University and I think that might have fucked me up as well. Life just sucks man... I legit have no clue wtf to do anymore. I am 30 and probably should be taking a job working at starbucks... fuck. I wish i had some support and any advice for someone on how i can turn my life around.... Fuck... I have also tried stopping watching porn and doing that and I think that definitely helps. I really hope life gets better for me. I have a hard time even trusting any people anymore because I have had some fucked up experiences with other crazy people who used me and took advantage of me.

7405,"I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone, my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job, only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work.

My worldview is so cynical and negative. I do not trust people, I am haunted by the expressions on their faces when we talk. I believe everyone thinks I am disgusting and stupid. Everything feels so pointless. I am waking up in cold sweats from nightmares where I have put it all to rest. I am in agony and I am suffering alone. I tried to practice gratitude or search for things that might change at all for me1. A new house in a new city with exciting amenities2.

I feel as if there is a dark presence near me stealing my energy as soon as I generate it. I feel as if there are two of me. Every time I think of an idea there is a negative side telling me that will not work. I will argue with myself for hours on end about any decision. I have tried therapy, I cannot find anyone in my town who will listen to me. it is a one hour intake session followed by a half an hour meeting with a therapist before rushing me directly to a psychiatrist.

7415,"I have never attempted suicide but over the last few months my life has become so overwhelming that its now a constant thought. My grandfather committed suicide when my mom was 10 years old which affected me in two ways. 1) I actually understand how painful it is for the people you leave behind, that is why I said I have never attempted it even though I have thought about it many many times, and 2) everyone in my family believes its hereditary and gets overly concerned when I am in a mood. It makes it impossible to talk to anyone close to me about my own thoughts of suicide because I feel like they will take it almost too seriously. I know that does not make sense but I actually hate when people feel sorry for me. So I bottle up my depression and lash out at the people I love. In a perverse way I almost wish they all hated me so that it would make it easier to leave them. The logical part of my brain says my life will turn around and the depression will subside - that is just how life is. Its just incredibly painful right now. Before anyone suggests I go see a therapist or get on medication, I have seriously thought about it but unfortunately my depression is currently stemming from the fact that my business failed, I am in a black hole of debt and I cannot afford health insurance. Money troubles - it does not get more cliche than that. I do not care if anyone reads this or responds I just found it incredibly therapeutic to finally vent all of this. This subreddit helped just to see that my situation is not unique and were all humans dealing with our own circumstances. there is probably someone in our life that is going through their own version of hell and well never know about it and there is definitely at least one person in our lives that deeply cares about us whether we recognize it or not. To all the people battling with depression, recognize it for what it is, and do not give up the fight. And to all the supportive members here I want you to know that you are making a difference.

7429,"I am currently in a living situation that is far from ideal and becoming unbearable. I need to move out, but I feel immense guilt and concern because of how much I am needed here. Ill start by explaining my relationship with my family. Older brother (X): My mom and I immigrated from Cuba when I was 4 years old. I am now 21. We had to leave X behind (we are 11 years apart), and he did not come to the US until I was 16. Because of the cost of communication and our extreme poverty throughout those years, X and I did not get to know each other at all. When he came, he felt like a stranger that I was expected to love because of our blood relation. From the ages of 16-21, he has engaged with my body in sexual manners without my consent (grabbing my ass, slapping my ass, getting on top of me, removing my clothing, forcefully entering the bathroom when I am showering, and looking at me naked, etc.). No one is aware of this except my therapist. I should mention that he is an alcoholic, and some of these instances occurred when he was under the influence. About 2 years ago he moved out with his girlfriend, but they recently broke up so he moved back home. I am now living with him again. Younger brother (Y): Y and I are also strangely enough 11 years apart but on the other end. He is such an impeccable human. He is my best friend. Watching him grow up has been the most fulfilling experience of my life. Unfortunately, the responsibility is too much. His dad passed away when he was young so it was only him, my mom, and I until 2016 when X moved to the US and joined us. My mom had to work a lot, and I was relied on to take care of my Y. This had an extreme effect on my education, extracurricular, social life, and mental health. I did not sign up to become a parent. Apart from financial support, Y relies on me for everything. My mom relies on me for everything. Mom: This is, of course, the most complex relationship I have. However, I will not go into as much detail. She treats me like a child, does not allow me to see friends, constantly making homophobic remarks (does not know I am gay), constantly offending my expression or lack thereof, does not support any of my decisions, forces me to shave armpits and legs because it is gross and is unladylike, cannot talk to her because everything turns into an argument.... the list truly never ends. - But she needs me to take care of Y, translate every document, upkeep the house, etc. I understand her pain and suffering. She has been through so much. And I know she truly does need me. This is why I am still here. I am needed. I am afraid of what will happen to them without me. But I am tired! Of being used, disrespected, neglected, uncomfortable, abused... I am so exhausted. I need to focus on my life. I need to prioritize myself- but I cannot. I am stuck. We are all currently living in a small 2 bedroom house. My mom is sleeping in the living room while Y and I share a room and X has his own. I am in college but because of the pandemic, I am staying here. I probably will be taking the upcoming semester off because its too difficult to do school here. A few weeks ago I was suicidal, and I almost did it, but I realized that the reason I wanted to kill myself was also the reason that I could not. I am in therapy for severe depression and learning how to socialize. I also experience derealization often. I do not know what I want to receive. I just needed to release. Thank you for listening.

7445,"As the title says, I have been going bald for the past few years and it is made my life a living hell without a shred of hope. it is started when I was around 16.5-17 (24 now) and basically my life had stopped ever since. I need to mention I am using the common medications for hair loss, and though I have had nice results for some time, my hair is now at its worst state ever and it is only getting worse.I am so lonley, have no social life since I am ashamed to go outside, have never been loved by someone or even got intimate with a woman, and it is all because of this malicious curse. I would trade absolutely everything I have to have a normal head of hair, like a guy my age should have. I would give everything for the privilege of leaving my room without being ancious about my appearance. I know the hair is not my only problem, but it is most definitely the core of all the other ones.I was actually just at the hair transplant clinic as I am still trying to fight for my life, hopeful to make an appointment, and although the guy there said it is still too early for me (does not mean It looks anywhere near decent) he showed me my pictures from 5 years ago when I had last visited the clinic, and I looked so much better and had fantastic hair compared to what I have now. In fact, I was once a pretty handsome guy (though never appreciated it), but the combination of depression and baldness have made me look old, sad and ugly to a point of no return.In that point of time it really does not matter whether I actually end my life or not, because I feel like I am already dead. Actually, I do not even feel like I am human anymore, just a pathetic, useless piece of rubbish. Having ""better days"" is actually the worst thing, because getting back to life after them only makes me feel much worse. My youth has been taken away from me and I feel doomed to be lonley and hating my appearance for the rest of my life.I have no idea what is the point of this post, but anyway, thank you for reading and have a nice rest of the week.

7448,"Hi, I do not know why I am writing this here or anywhere at all, but I feel like a mess and do not know what to do and pheraps someone here can help me.I cannot say I have ever struggled in life, I had everything I needed to this day, my parents always suported me even when I probablt disnt deserve it, I have a social life and friends even tho I am not very social, I feel like I have every thing One would need to live right. However I do not feel good about myself, have not felt since around 7 grade. Even tho I had everyting i could not bring myself to work towards a future. I never tried my best in school even tho I was fully aware that I needed to study in order to get a good job and live a confortable life, to make my parents proud and retribute the effort they put in to me. I ended up staying one more year in highschool finnishing a subject i failed and that marks one of my biggest lows, I saw my friends going to college having fun but most importantly going forward towards something, and there I was left behind with no purpose whatsoever. I started to feel depressed and started to stay late at night just thinking about life itself, purpose, value, right and wrong, it would call it an existencial crisis where i looked at myself not as me but as 1 in 7 billion, things I had as absolute such as concepts and values started to seem subjective and as time went on i came to face what I now know as nihilism. I started to stop sleeping in my bed because it seemed pointless, talking to people seemed meaningless to me, i resorted to procrastination in a whole nother level just so I would not have to think about living and life in general, the world to my eyes was if it had lost its color. And that when it hit me, why do I have to live like this? All this thoughts, lonelyness, zero purpose, crying nights, what reason do I have to stay? Suicide made its home in my head from there on but I still feared deaths, there were a few times where I grabed my fathers gun and just sat on the floor thinking, can I do this? What if this? What if that? I never could bring myself to do it and I always ended up cryng over how I cannot commit to anything even could not bring myself to end that cycle. After sometime i friend presented me a girl which would become my first girlfriend, the first person to this day to make me feel loved even tho how shity I felt I was. The relationship had a bad start since due to what was going in my head i could not bring myself to fully trust anyone and she was no exeption, everytime she went out to party I was overwhelemed with axiety and panic attacks, i could not contain it and had to talk with her to calm down which would always mess her night. With time and her icentive i went to college as well, my parents had to getMoney from the bank to pay for it but i felt like I was getting out of my hole, fjnnaly a light at the end of the tunnel. But it was not like that, today she left me 5 months ago because of my lack of my pupose in life, even tho my parents made the biggest effort I still have to make an extra year in college due to subjects i left due to my lack of effort and purpose. And now I feel slowly faling back into that hole, I even lost 15kg working out and trying to better myself but still i cannot seem to bring myself to ""live"" and still lack pupose. I try doing things but allways find some sort of escapism. Lately I have been feeling like a lost case, i suicide has been on my mind lately as well, i just do not know what to do, I still fear death and the worst part is that I had EVERYTHING and I messed up, i threw out every oportunity that is was given to me while there are other people strugling and still make an effort to move forward, i feel miserable, a failiure, and a waste of effort that was put on me. I am sorry for the long text and the bad english but I dknt want to worry my family and friends but still wanted to share what I felt for at least on time in my life, thank you for reading and if you are strugling please keep going, oportunities will arise but please take them, make it worth it do not be like me.

And then my loving, lovely cat that I cannot help.. what the hell am I here for then? I wish she could just get better and I could get sick instead.

I want to cut so bad right now but I do not want to use a knife again, I want to use a sharo blade but I cannot get one. She is also one of the people that thinks that a positive mindset will make everything better. Well mom, it is kind of hatd to get my grades up when I gave up on school and life. I hate my mom",Suicidal
7476,"I know...the title sounds annoying and desperate...but I really needed to tell someone, anyone. This is probably a result of PMS...but I really do want someone to lay in bed and cry to. I am so touch starved and lonely. I have felt this way for years. I just want someone to hold me and reassure me. To comfort me through all the shit I go through. Sometimes the loneliness gets so bad and I cry alone in my bed. Sometimes I wrap myself around a pillow and have to pretend it is someone, a boyfriend, for comfort. This is one of those times. Ik after this I will get up, brush myself off, and get on with my life, like I always do. I have to. But it would just be so nice to have someone hold me and whisper sweet nothings to me. To feel his warm embrace and his fingers play with my hair. To make me feel like I am worth protecting. Like I am important to at least someone. I am always fighting with myself internally. Ik that I should not have to depend on anyone for happiness. That I should be my own independent woman or whatever. And it is not like I am going to settle for someone who does not treat me right....and I know life is not all about love and relationships....but I just...I love feeling WANTED by somebody. Maybe that makes me needy and codependent but I just love it so much. I love being praised and spoiled with love. It hurts when I see other people living the life I want to live. Like I am happy for them...but it hurts bc I want that so badly. I want to be somebody is baby too. somebody is world. I want to be special to somebody too. Honestly it does not help that I might have daddy issues....Anyways I needed to get that off of my chest. Thanks for reading it all if you have gotten this far. &lt;:) I want a boyfriend so badly right now",Depression
7479,"Hey Reddit, sorry if this is too much but I really do not know where else to turn to so any advice at all would be helpful.One of my closest friends since I was 15 has been going through a lot recently, she is open about her feelings and what has happened to her and has always said she feels like her life is not worth living. We had not talked for a while since 2018 but she reached out last month and we have been hanging out a lot since then.However, she told me that at the beginning of this year she was sexually assaulted by an immediate family member and since then she has been traumatised and has developed PTSD. She told the rest of her family about this when it happened and wanted to press charges against him but they do not hear that as the perpetrator is under the age of 16, and I think this is the main reason as to her feeling this way as she told me she had always been quite close with her mother (who does not want her to press charges). Since then she has been living in a refuge as she cannot stand to be around her family, understandably, but it means that I cannot even try to call emergency services to come to her location as these places do not give out their address (even to the residents).She seems like she will go through with it as I found out she has been spending all of her money on her friends and buying people gifts, which sounds like her because she is an amazing person who has always been there for other people. And now it feels like no matter what I say or do, it is not enough and as someone who has thought the same things as her I understand that completely. She also told one of her friends that she has bought the 'equipment' to commit suicide and is planning on doing it next week (she did not specify which day as she does not want anyone stopping her) as she had tried to get through to her mother again earlier today about pressing charges but to no avail.I have spent a lot of time with her recently as it felt really good seeing her again and catching up after so many years, it is like she never left but she is about to. She reconnected me with one of my old buddies too, but since then told us that it was part of her 'bucket list.' I really do not know what to do I cannot even thin straight so I am trying to ask anyone I know for some advice, the situation she is in is a horrible one which I cannot even fathom so it feels wrong even trying to look for some way to help her as she is so insistent on what she is planning to do.If it helps with the advice, we live in the UK. Any advice or help whatsoever would be so greatly appreciated. My (M21) friend (F21) has been planning to k*ll herself next week and I do not know what to do",Suicidal

7488,"I cannot seem to do anything right. I lack awareness on all levels. I am bad at almost everything I do, I am just slow in general. I am 16 and it seems like I am surrounded by smart people even though the only reason it seems that way is because I am just such a moron. I am so self conscious about my intelligence that I can barely focus on anything without constant thoughts about killing myself. I am constantly reminded of my stupidity and I hate it. I am trying to do activities like meditation, yoga, cardio, rubix cubes, and other hobbies to get sharper. but its so hard to keep going because the struggle is way harder for a below average person like myself during mentally demanding activities. I have other problems with myself but there are too many to count. Even physically I cannot stand myself, I feel like a disappointment to my parents every time they look at me. If literally anyone sees this, please try and tell me what I can do to combat this because I am at a loss. Maybe a suggestion to boost myself mentally, because that would give me more self confidence. As I said though I am trying different hobbies, but if you have any testimonials from your own experience or good insights to my kind of situation please comment, I am starting to lose hope.

7494,"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself. The relationship was quite one-way I had to put a lot of love in and I was not getting anything back, I feel dumb for hanging on to it for years trying to cling some kind of hope.

Too scared of making a mistake, scared of risk and change, even if it is change for the better, something I know I want deep down. So to stimulate motivation, I have made a pact of life and death with myself; if I fail to aquire a new home by the latest deadline of this upcoming December 31st, I will take my own life by opiate overdose in a motel room on January 5th of next year, probably sometime in the evening. It does not help that I want to die anyway. A death pact is hardly a motivator when you are already suicidal. It seems like ending my own existence would be easier and a more certain win than anything else I have ever done as it seems as though my hopes and dreams are nothing but shattered shards of failure and regret. I want to see beauty in life, a reason to keep living, but darkness is blotting it all out now. I hope things change soon. They have to or I am going to die. If my moving plan is not successful by the end of the year, I am killing myself January 5th, 2022",Suicidal
7542,"I have been changing numbers constantly just lately among other stuff I have been doing or not doing due to this feelings that I got during a very toxic relationship, I was doin better before it but the shame and guilt I got out of this just took me many steps back into the dark I used to walk in. I do not really know what I felt, what I am feeling, I just feel I am done. Its weird because during the course of it I felt pity, I felt scared, I felt sorry but mostly ashamed and guilty I still think I could have avoid all of this. I do not have any energy left on me. I used to be a huge player and the fact that I was reminded and worse constantly manipulated and tested and lied to did not help me a lot, yet I still feel this emptiness. Again. Its not the person and my mom blames me she says I am spoiled I do what I want but its not like that. I just want to end it. End all the pain, I cannot take it anymore. I feel like In the past couple of months I have started over and over and over and over from scratch and I cannot stand up again It just hurts so much like either its all my fault or I am just the victim which also somehow makes it even worse, like how stupid I need to be to be usedlike that ?i do not got answers to any of these questions and its been like this all my life.

7544,"Hi, hoping this will make me feel better. This summer has been hard. I am medicated for anxiety/depression, have a partner I love and that is so supportive, a dog that means everything to me and a safe place to live but it still feels impossible to be happy most days. I work as an RDH and that has taken a toll, especially since COVID- its exhausting. I like the perspective my job gives me, I have a great boss and coworkers but having to always be on for patients is SO draining when I feel like shit myself. Its important to me to be an empathetic provider/provide positive experiences so that is probably the hardest part. I get a lot of nervous, anxious / patients in pain and I feel like a sponge- all that gets soaked up. I wish I lived somewhere else so I felt like I am not here to pay off debt until I die. Parents are retiring soon and I just think welp, that will never be me. cannot afford good enough medical insurance to get quality care, nothing is/has ever been worth the copay. I used to want to have kids to give them the ~happy childhood~ I did not have but why add another burden to the planet. The future is not sustainable. Country is legit on fire, nature is dying. Basic truths or facts do not matter anymorejust stupid ass culture wars to bring in ratings and profit. I remember thinking the first time I wanted to die was when I was 8. Thought Id definitely be dead before college so why worry about that. Then oh, once I achieve x y and z it will get better. It has to! How can humanity have gone this long if this is the reality? Yet here we are. Cool Existential dreadusa",Depression
7550,"I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is ""for girls"" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my ""friends"" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this ""cool"" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of ""friends"" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said ""that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be""I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this ""one man wolf pack"" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am. I still deal with the insecurities and fears from all those years ago and feel really emotionally stunted, like there is still this scared kid trapped in the body of this cold, logical body.For those who took the time, thank you so much for reading all of this, any advice on what I can do to move past my fears and insecurities are appreciated. Hopefully I did not come off as too whiny. Looking to share my story of being bullied.",Depression
7551,"I am 20 year old male. I am struggling with depression for so long, that i cannot even remember when i started feel depressed. I have been depressed my most of my life and never, ever think that ending my life as a solution, but in the past few mounths I have been thinking alot about killing myself alot because i cannot see a way out. I do not think I am going to be able to normal. I cannot even remember when i was normal like not even happy but normal. I am a virgin and never had any relationships. I have tried bunch of times but everytime i tried i got rejected, friendzoned and sometimes got blocked. Last year i decided to stay platonic, i said myself ""well if i do not propose i do not get rejected"" that worked not well but better than be heart broken. My past is full of pain and betreyal. My parents divorced because they cheated eachother. I was 14 when they got divorced and i kept all my anger inside then. I still keeping all of my anger inside because I am afraid to let it out, i do not know what kind of monster would id be turning into and do not know if i ever be able to come back.

7555,"lost my dog on monday, he was always my brother and best friend - my everything. I have spent more time with him on this earth than without him. i love and miss him so, so fucking much already. he was without doubt the best thing that ever happened to me and i would do anything in the world to bring him back. fuck I would do everything to just have one more fucking minute with him. it hurts so much to go to bed without him, to wake up without him. I have been suicidal for years and there were a few times where i was insanely close to ending it all, but now i am for once glad that i did not kill myself. it would have just shortened our time together even more. in all these years I have never felt this much pain before, i just want to hug him and be with him. it breaks my heart not to be able to know whether he is okay, whether he is safe, whether he is alone. i want to be with him so bad, the thought of never being able to hold him in my arms again tears me up insidei cannot kill myself because of my sister, but if it was not for her, I would do it in a heartbeat why do the best ones have to go",Suicidal

But since I was a child I had my best friend with me. In highschool he and I started dating and 2 years ago we got married. We had no one but each other. A lot of years were just us vs the world and it felt amazing coming home to him everyday. But then I found out I was pregnant in May. Since then, he completely changed. He has cheated twice now with two different girls. I caught him both times. I have no family, no friends. I lost my job. I told my therapist what is happening and she asked why I am even seeing her still. I stopped going to therapy and I am sick of them not helping. I decided I want to end my life while I am pregnant. I know that sounds macabre and evil, i know. But no one will love the baby but me. I do not want her to grow up feeling as alone and unwanted as me. I decided to do it several days ago. I have my notes (one for my husband one for my mom) written out. Every day for 3 days now I sit down in the bed, take a blood thinner, say goodbye to my cat and lay out the notes. But one I grab the knife I just freeze. I usually stay like that until 3 when i hear my husband pull up and put everything away. This feels like the right thing to do but I just cannot do it.

7561,"I have been attending university for about 5 years now, bouncing between programs and failing multiple classes. This summer I was able to complete about three more courses and I could graduate with a general degree. Its about 3 days now until i would have had my last exam and I have not done schoolwork at all. This is something I am not interested in and I had no motivation to do any of my assignments or work and now its come to bite me in the ass. Luckily, I got accepted to college in September for a program I think I am interested in. I could not find it in me to push myself to do anything for this, I cannot stop thinking about how disappointed my family is going to be knowing I am a failure. The only reason I was doing it was so it would look good on my resume and to make my parents proud of me. Its so hard to watch people I went to Uni with graduate, I envy their ability to put their education before their emotions and push themselves, I could not and now that is 5 years of money and time wasted - I just want to graduate and feel accomplished.

7562,"Paradoxically, all I want is to do is to not have to do stuff. Like not having to work, which is honestly one of the biggest reasons I hate living. Any job whatsoever is hell, every single job.But you are forced to work 8 hours a day (or even more) to survive, for bills and food and such. Torture, especially if you are doing it just to not be homeless.I just have NO reasons to live. Only reason I did not off myself is because I do not want to make my parents suffer, or my cat. And I will not ever off myself, do not have it in me to do that. I guess many years of anhedonia since a relatively young age does this to you. I wish I could just lie in bed all day at least, but no, I have to endure torture for so many hours a day by having to work. Every second is torture. At this point, I am not even sure I am depressed anymore. I just do not like/want anything in life, do not have any reasons to live. do not want kids, do not want a relationship, do not want friends, do not want money, do not want success, do not want anything really.

7573,"From the outside I appear to be successful, I moved up in the corporate world quickly and at an early age. I also have my own business that does well. None of it means anything, it all just makes me feel more stuck in my current circumstances and life. Truth is I have been suicidal for over a year, I have letters written, plans in place but I just cannot commit to a date. I have no idea how to get out of this pointless life, there is no point to any of this. Work yourself to death so that you can retire then die. Suicide honestly seems to be a logical short cut when you weigh the years of work and sacrifice vs the ones your supposed to enjoy later in life. I came close a few months back but could not follow through. I am even more determined now though. Every day is just a chore, and I do not see the benefit on the other side of it all. I used to be healthy and really active, I cannot even get motivated to leave the house any more.

7579,"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource. But going it alone when I am at this point can be scary and feels really painful and is probably kind of stupid sometimes. &amp;#x200B;TL;DR when you have felt really suicidal but rational enough to realize you should do something to prevent yourself from acting on it, what did you do? How did it work out? Need thoughts on going to the ER or not",Suicidal

7588,"This is my first post ever talking about my depression, idk where to start. This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice, but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her.

Two days and four hours into the semester, the sudden spike of covid-19 deaths caused my school to shut down and send us all home. For the past year, I have been separated from my flock, and last week we were reunited at last. This week has been everything I dreamed of for the past year, and my vaccinated friends and I are soaking in each others presence. Today, the bomb dropped again. Due to the increase in the delta variant, we are being sent home again. I had a ptsd flashback to the first time we were sent home and could not get ahold of myself. Every time I am here, it is far too brief, and it is even more painful to say goodbye this time. I was to graduate next week, and my classmates and I will likely never see each other again. Now I am suddenly going home to no job, because that too is once again suspended due to the delta variant. Because of the unvaccinated people in my country, I am forced to lose out on the only thing that gave my life any meaning anymore, and I am being forced to relive the most traumatic day of my life.

I did not just think ""I do not want to be alive"", I thought ""maybe I will not be soon"". I thought of some familiar fantasy of dying, but this this time it was real life. I thought about how I could enact that fantasy. Then I wondered if that was really a realistic way to die. I do not want to die painfully. And I do not want to be resusitated and disabled by damage afterwards. So I spent the day researching suicide method outcomes and considering how nasty or available each one would be, all while pushing my two kids on the swings at the park and buying them some chocolate, making dinner, talking to my spouse, putting the kids to bed.I just cannot describe how strange it feels for these fantasies to have moved from this thing I did to cope with how stressed I was feeling to this other, ""oh I can do this"" feeling. It was so unexpected. It was just a normal day.I have never had these thoughts before, and I just wanted to write it down somewhere. I found this subreddit in the course of the day, and I have reddit so I thought it would be as good a place as any. July 28, 2021, maybe a new era in my life started today for reasons I cannot really understand.Thanks for listening Today was the first time i really thought about suicide",Suicidal
7611,"Untill now I was the so called ""good guy"". Always trying to be pleasant around others, always trying to help, always saying ""thank you"" and ""you are welcome"" when needed etc. Recently I decided to adopt and raise a cat. But there is something very dark that came to the surface which I did not know that existed, and I have the very hard to resist temptation to hurt my cat, watch her squeal in fear as I am being a total piece of shit to her. First few weeks were great. I may have been rough to her sometimes during those weeks but it was nothing too serious. We were always sleeping together, playing together and we were practically inseparable. She was happy, and I was happy too.But once I decided to return to the house I grew up in, where some childhood trauma events have occurred, it was like a switch flipped, and I became a monster. I became very abusive towards my cat, and I have a very hard time stopping. Now I try to keep her outside my room and encourage her to hide because there is a monster inside me, which I cannot control.And because of that, I feel like I do not deserve anyone in my life. I was being a hypocrite all along, pulling of an act, and I deserve to be alone. Hell, I feel so guilty that I want to outright die, because I cannot live with the guilt and shame because of this.I know there will be people who will hate me for what I said. And I am really scared because of what I am about to post. But then again, I have never done the right choice anyway.I deserve the hate. I am lost",Suicidal
7613,"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now. Thank you for reading this post if you have, but if not I understand as well. TL;DR: I am killing myself in a month and I generally do not have any actualy reason to want to keep living Killing Myself Soon",Depression
7614,"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",Suicidal
7620,"I (17M) have been diagnosed with Aspergers, although my experiences are better described as high functioning autism (although I do not function at all lol), a semi-official type of Autism. Luckily, my autism was recognised very early in my life, when I was about 3/4 years old. I was diagnosed with PDD-NOS (later with Aspergers). Because of my amazing parents who fought very hard for me to get the help I needed, I got special training in primary school. I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my ""explosions"", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends. However, this training had an unintended consequence, I was convinced that the only way to be accepted in society was to isolate myself when it all got too much for me. This does not always work out, and afterwards I feel really guilty, especially if it happens around people I love, because I see it leaves an impact on them. It also does not really help that I am constantly irritated, because of the pandemic, lack of sleep and maybe depression?I feel so guilty for being such an asshole, my friends and family do not deserve it, it is also the reason I feel like I do not deserve their love. Does anyone have similar experiences and/or advice how to convince myself I am worthy of love? I would really love to hear your thoughts I feel like I do not deserve love",Depression
7621,"NSFWI have been depressed since a child. I watched my grandfather die at age 4 of a heart attack in front of me, I was sexually assaulted by my neighbors and age 7 my bio dad passed away. When I was 12 one of my friends committed suicide by hanging himself in his home. I lost my paternal grandma age 18, my maternal grandma age 20 and step grandma age 21 all whom I was extremely close with. I lost my uncle a few weeks before Christmas due to a heart attack just after losing my paternal grandmother right before Thanksgiving.In 2015 my cousin was murdered (shot in the back of the head) in 2018 my paternal grandfather to a heart attack and we had to pull the plug, he died on my fathers birthday 6 February which is 6 days before my birthday. Also, in June 2018 I lost my younger brother due to a devastating car accident that left his body mangled and we found this out the day after it happened, right after my other grandfathers funeral. My brother did not have his ID on him so they could not identify him immediately.2020 I lost my aunt due to a heart attack two days after Thanksgiving. 14 January 21 I lost my mother after her battled with Covid-19. Due to having small children, one with severe respiratory issues and the pandemic I had not seen my mother. The last time I saw her alive was in early December at my aunts funeral. That was the last time I hugged her and held her hand.Forward to March and I lost another aunt, she lost her battle with leukemia.there is more death and many other reasons but my main trigger has been death/loss. I have cried because I am tired of living and want to end my life. I get angry that I have kids because I am afraid of what my loss will do to them and my wife. Especially, after already losing a brother and recently losing two aunts and our mother, I am afraid of what would happen to my brothers if I kill myself.But, the desire is increasing everyday.

But this is the second time in my life where I feel like I have absolutely no options left. I tried so many ways to be happy and to survive in the past year and they all failed spectacularly or simply evaporated. The crazy thing is that it is not even my fault, I did everything I could. Its the pandemic, it is the economy, it is our slow-ass indecisive bureaucracies, it is everyone being sad at the exact same time.I am talking to a military recruiter soon because I feel like it is my only option left in order to have any level of economic security. But everything else failed, so what is keeping this from not working out too? I have already come really close to killing myself in the past month and a half.

Practicing self care. Exploring my spirituality.Then, this happens. I am in constant pain, no energy, my lungs burn when I breathe. I cannot sleep. I cannot do weightlifting and my body dysmorphia is back full force. I cannot be around my loved ones. I cannot go to therapy.

7633,"So this is my first time posting on Reddit, apologies if I mess up. To make a long story short, I failed my first year of college. My parents are okay people. they have done some bad stuff to me in the past, but I know they love me so I try to not put it against them. So my dad took out a loan to help me pay for college. Thing is, after COVID restrictions, my mental health went down, way down. I was hardly showing up to my online classes, hardly doing assignments. I failed most of my classes both semesters. I am still enrolled in my school by a gracious loophole the school provides, but I did lose my financial aid for next year and my parents do not know any of this. They are going to pay off the loan today, and its killing me inside. I do not know if they will find out I failed this year or not, but either way I feel that I am such a horrible child, even if I cannot help my mental illness I could have reached out. I do not even want to go to college anymore. I do not want my parents to dump so much money on my stupid suicidal ass, I want to die so they do not have to pay off my loans. I cannot go on, I feel like a walking failure for not just doing my work. Why did not I do it? what is wrong with me? I hate myself so much, why cannot I just be a good child to my parents? I cannot do anything right so I feel like the only way to repent is to die any advice is appreciated I am such a horrible child",Suicidal
7641,"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

I have been working towards improving my symptoms, and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective.

I need a kind stranger to tell me what they are going through as well so I do not feel so alone. I am hurting really bad. My heart and spirit feel broken. Anyone else? Anyone Else Having The Worst Year of Their Lives? I desperately want to feel less alone and reading about the what others are going through helps.",Depression
7678,"I give up, I have been battling suicide and suicidal thoughts since I was ten.I used to have something that made me keep on living, my dogs, my mom, my friends; this is not the case anymore.I know this is selfish but I really do not have the mental strength anymore, I cannot find the strength in anybody, I feel like my life is a subtle form of agony (I will never compare my life to what some people go through, and I know I definitely do not have it worse, but I cannot explain it, its kind of like as if it was a continuous loop, or as if you were just chained and could not get out), I just want to be free, I have waited years for finding the light at end of the tunnel after I said no almost last minute at my first/only suicidal attempt, but I did not, I just experienced more bullying, more psychological abuse, more trauma, more hatred for myself (eating disorders and body dysmorphia), although I have taken some big steps on the last thing, and although I am starting to see myself as beautiful I still cannot talk or act normally when I see someone (whatever they are a he, a she, or a them) that its beautiful because I feel inferior to them, I am afraid of getting insulted in the streets because I am ugly, I think Ill never be loved (as in loved by a boyfriend), heck sometimes I even question my gender (I am 99% sure its not actual gender dysphoria but rather envy or just the feeling of being someone different) at times I do not feel comfortable or part of my friends group, I wish I could tell them how I feel but I cannot because I hate being vulnerable.I wish I could...you know, but I literally have NOTHING to do it (or at least to not have a painful end).Probably still going to prepare in case it happens, I am going to give my password to one of my friends so that they can continue to post content on my insta (I have not posted since February my followers deserve some damn content) I wish I could do it but I do not have anything",Suicidal
7681,"(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. ""Work on your self esteem"" or ""You sound insecure"". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities",Depression
7696,"My partner broke up with me. We dated for 8 months and were extremely co dependant. It was not a healthy relationship because she did not want to get better and I wanted her to. We met up and she is with someone else as soon as a month after, an extreme alcoholic drinking 750mls every night and I am still in love with her.The breakup is what originally sent me into the depression, but it was not just that. Where I live was going above and beyond with covid restrictions even though people were getting vaccinated and you would be fined for even seeing your family. My parents were being insane, my brother was not doing well, and it took a huge toll on me too. More than I know, I think.Then I made the impulsive decision to get an apartment right after the breakup. The move in date is September 1st and as much as I should be happy, that makes me even more depressed for some reason.I have no friends with depression, I have no one that talks to me constantly (my ex did so I am feeling extremely lonely after just getting cut off from that), and I just feel so exhausted and alone. I want to go out, but I want to be alone. I feel nothing - literally nothing. I am just a numb husk that gets stuck in depressive thought loops over and over and wakes up to panic attacks.I have been in bed for over a week now, my room is beyond disgusting, I cannot eat and look like skin and bones, and my Dad basically has to take care of me because I cannot. I have gone out once or twice but I feel nothing the whole time. I cannot live like this. I have clinical depression and have extremely intense depressive episodes multiple times a year but this is the worst one I have had since I was in fucking jr high. (I am in college now). I think I am suicidal but I am so numb and empty I cannot even tell. The healthcare system in general, let alone the mental healthcare, where I live is abysmal but I am genuinely considering calling the crisis line and getting myself admitted to the mental health ward. The only thing stopping me is how much it would affect my family.I just feel so lost and SO alone and I do not know what to do. I think I came here to just talk to more people who are struggling like me, but if you have any advice please let me know. I am so tired.

7697,"I really do not want to because its honestly very depressing for me to think that at the young age of 23, I am already considering throwing away my one and only life. I wish I believed in some form of reincarnation but I honestly do not. I think that if it were possible to somehow trade my life away for another and start all over again, I would do it without hesitation. But nobody is capable of figuring out what truly lies beyond death and still be around to tell about it. Is it just an empty void or is it eternal torture what is waiting for me? I am scared to find out. I honestly do not think Ill miss anyone or anything that exists in this world. I am having trouble finding new interests to keep me entertained and I am losing the very few that I do. I love my parents, I would be devastated when the time comes when they are no longer around. I honestly do not think I could say the same about any of my siblings, any secondary family members, or anyone else in general. I have become estranged with just about everyone. Most of them just see me as a lazy bum who does not care to improve himself, and maybe they are right. But I am also not right in the head, so can you really blame me for the way that I feel? I feel alone.I have ideas on how i could get better but I am just too lazy to do anything about it. I think most of this laziness comes from how mentally strenuous some of my ideas are and whether or not it will even be worth it in the end. Id hate to give myself a bigger headache than what I already have right now, all for nothing.At this point, I find myself romanticizing the act of suicide more and more. To finally take charge of your own life and do the inevitable. I kind of hope that my life will get progressively worse just so that making the decision to commit suicide will be a lot easier. Or at least motivate me enough to finally take action into improving myself out of desperation. I am at the beginning stages of considering suicide and its making me very uncomfortable.",Suicidal
7700,"I do not know where else to turn to. It feels like my brain hates me. I should be happy, I have a good job, I have a roof over my head, and clothes on my back, more than a lot of other people have. I should be able to smile, but it drains more energy out of me than I can possibly describe. The voices in my head tell me I am not good enough, I will never be good enough. Pathetic. Useless. Worthless. Stupid. waste of space, time, energy, and matter. the world would be better without me, besides what is a small screw in the grand scheme of things, the world will still spin, my family will move on. Maybe without me dragging them down, they can finally be happy. I look in the mirror and I harbor nothing but disgust and resentment for that \*thing\* looking back at me. and then it speaks to me, Pathetic. Useless. I learned at a young age, people will pretend to care about you if they can see your scars, so I cut my legs, they cannot see those, no one will ever see those. they pretend to care, and then talk behind your back, ""oh look, cutting again, how PATHETIC"" ""grow up"" ""be a man"" I have told my family about the monsters, they say its just a phase, 'its not a fucking phase I just want to feel ok, ok motherfucker now you have got my attention, I need to change a couple things', but what to change, I eat right, I exercise, literally only drink water. My dog is the only thing in this world keeping me here. I made the decision to kill myself June 23rd 2020, at 5:21 am, I tied a noose and hung it in my closet, wrote a note that no one would ever care about and stepped into my closet for what I thought was the last time, then my dog barked, and she never does that. I cannot do that to her, So I will live for her. but how Pathetic, staying alive for a dog. an animal that would forget about me in a month. I have family that would forget about me in a month, ""friends"" that do not even care now. I bring up my past to family, my parent told me its ""impossible for a man to get raped"" well, guess I am the impossible, happened twice in my life, once at 13 and again at 15, so I secluded myself away from women and now I have a hard time opening up to them when trying to get a relationship, and they do not understand that, not exactly something to bring up on a first date, and heh, never get second ones. How Pathetic, typing to a bunch of strangers who do not care. why should they. I have tried getting help, but the meds make me feel worse, all of them, the therapists push their agendas, no one is against you, they are only for themselves, but if I am not for myself, then no one is. Worthless. I have even done things that I thought id never do, I have prayed, and prayed, looking, asking for help, for the strength to get rid of my demons, my monsters, to no avail. The monster just laughs at me, Useless. I used to be smart, used to have a lot of practical knowledge, now its all superficial, Stupid.

I want to reach out, but I am just a waste of space, time, energy and matter, I do not matter.

Problem is, I have not actually done any of that.

My father has become more controlling, grounding me for stupid things, taking away my car, not letting me see my boyfriend or friends, gaslighting me for not spending time with him, etc. My mother has gotten better she has not manipulated me in a while so I think were fine. Her husband on the other hand, says that I am the reason my mothers health has deteriorated, both of my stepparents have said that I am the reason our family is dysfunctional. Sometimes I like to think I am stronger than others, that I have it worse than my friends, but that is not true at all. I am weaker than all of them. My life is so easy.

7712,"that is the question I have been asking myself, for months. I am underage (less than 15) and I think I can asked myself that fricking question. I live with my mom and my two sisters, my dad live in another country with another family. But I do not care, that is not why I am asking myself that. One of my sisters (14 years old) said (when I wad 5/6) that I was a big baby, and that I just needed to suck up my problems and grow up, because that is what adults do. I was 5, why the fvck you want me to act like an adult ?! But I was little, and she was the sister I admired, so I did it. My other sister (17 years old) was the one that I was not really talking to, because of our age difference. But we had the same interest (book, anime, japan, culture...) so we started talking more and more together. But I sincerelly regret it. She thinks that just because she is older than me, she can do what my mom do (scolding me when I do something wrong and all that). And she think it, but WAY too much. Example: one of the day her best friend was home, I did some noise will drinking my chocolate milk and she smashed my head on the cup, and I started crying and bleeding. Her friend told her that she was exagerating and to say sorry or help me but no, she think it was the right thing and she does not cared. Example 2: I started fighting with her (verbally) and she pinned me against the sofa, hurting my shoulders and I pushed her in stomach so I cn go to my room. But there, my other sis (14) literally started beating me up, till I was on the floor, crying and screaming: ""stop ! It hurts ! Stop fucking beating me !!!"" And my sis (17) said: ""stop ! do not get physical !"" But she was the one pushing me on the sofa. When I called my mom, she said she did not want to know anything. Example 3: yesterday (27 july 2021) i was playing fortnite with my cousin (10) and step-sis (10). I am used to curse but they know I was sarcastic. I said shut the f up to my step sis and syam (17 yo big sis name) started yelling at me ""do not talk like that"" like i xas talking ti this bitch. Then she said things like ""y you responding"" (because that is how a conversation works) and at the end she said ""to you think I am your friend"" and i was like: ""well i do not pick people with such petsonnality as my friend"" BUT, since i wanted to finish that argument i just said ""uh... no ?"" And she smashed my head on the switch i was playing with. I screaming ""WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU ???"" and pushed her in the stomch so that crazy would go away. In conclusion, i have a scratch on my face, that i will maybe keep 4ever. Yesterday, because of that, I scarified myself. Its been 13 days I did not do it. I do not care about the mark, but the fact she would want it on my face is what hurts. I tried to end my life multiple times, since I was 9. The first time was because a person in my family r^ped me. Since that I cannot feel pleasure in life, and even if I did forgive that person, she is still horrible with me. My sexuality is a problem. My mom said ""you are lucky I accept you"". Like if you do not think you will accept me, why you did a kid ? But some people get kicked out, so I guess I am lucky. My gender is a problem. I identify myself as a genderfluid person, but he/him pronous are the one I love the most (even if I use all pronous, even it). Who am I is a problem. I need to smile. Always. Even if I am just eating. My mom said these exact words:""Smile. I said SMILE ! Ugh !!! Why will not you smile ?? it is not like you are unhappy either ??? Do you even have a reason to not be hapoy, to smile ???"" Well do I have a reason to smile and to be happy, while I am not doing anything except eating ? And last but not least, what I asked. I never asked to be born, to live with my mother, to go see friends, to go to someone is birthday, to live, to be feed, to have a house or go to school. I only asked a few things, and one of them is to go see a therapist. I asked it. I asked it three time. But even if she said yes, she did not do anything. And so, what am i supposed to do ???I am supposed to smile if I am not ? I am supposed to stay with my mom because she fighted for me for years, even if she do not care about my mental health or well being ? I am supposed to let my sisters hit me, just because they are a few years older ? I am supposed to do things, but how can I do them if I cannot even take care of myself ?

It was hell watching him get worse without being able to do anything. I still managed to stay on top of my grades and responsibilities. He passed months ago. Nothing seemed right after, but I had to carry out his will, handle his funeral, etc. so it kept me from just sitting with my thoughts. About a week later I found out my SO was cheating with his kids mom. My grades slipped that semester, but I got them back up and got a new job.

I was struggling with my classes and have just stopped working on them, not even checking the grades. Letting my ex/not ex SO continue to be around despite asking them to let me heal and move on. they have been attentive and loving and stopped drinking but it does not feel the same anymore. I do not think its fair to them because I do not have hope that were going to last and I do not know that I even feel sad about that after giving so many chances.

I was pretty miserable because my return was the result of several disappointments and failures in a row.The 2 following years were pretty dark, I did not know what to do with myself and a childhood friend that was very dear to me kind of betrayed me and it totally broke my heart.In 2019, I finally found a job that was perfect for me. I knew the place, my boss was very understanding (regarding my shyness, anxiety etc), I was good at it, I got my first salary and the first car etc : Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time, meaning I was not earning much, and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment. Then my contract ended and I have been looking for a job since last January. I have been applying to jobs all over the country and oversea, super confident, but I barely get any feedback and when I do, we proceed to have an interview but then I do not hear back from anyone.I was okay with living at home because my mom and brother were still there but she divorced him (which I am happy about, my dad has been sucking the joy out of us and belittling us our entire lives), and my brother left too, so now I am stuck with my dad I cannot even look in the eyes, and broke. I was supposed to live with my mom but her new boyfriend moved in instead. That hurt too but I want to let her live her life with him, she deserves it after years of submission to my dad.I know I could try to apply to a different job that is hiring more in the meantime, but as I mentionned, I am very discreet, anxious, shy, but also clumsy, distracted, and I am pretty sure that I would be a burden and suck at anything that is not of my qualifications.

I am alone but people on the internet have been helping me to feel less alone and I appreciate that a lot. I cut myself a lot and I am not embarrassed about it or ashamed of it. It helps me to feel less suicidal, and its the only thing that does that for me. I leave my cuts and scars out in the open for all to see. I do not hide it anymore. I want to traumatize everyone with the realization of how much they truly do not care. Most people are basically just happy to watch people they act like they care about suffer and die and I want them all to remember that the rest of their lives. Not all people are like this, but most are. Maybe after they realize how much they truly do not care at all they will learn how to actually care for once and try to save someone is life. Maybe people would not get so desperately suicidal if people actually cared more...",Suicidal
7744,"I so desperately want this to be over. I despise every last thing about myself. I am 30, and I have never experienced any kind romantic or sexual intimacy, because I am an ugly gay man and completely inept when it comes to dating (I have no experience). I have been so poor that I cannot feed myself. My career as a professional musician has gone down the tubes because of the pandemic, and I am stuck with a new job that gives me intense anxiety and amplifies my self-hatred. Nobody in my life has any idea it has gotten this bad, and I do not want to reach out to friends or family, because I am sick of the well-intentioned responses that make me feel to blame, or worse about myself.While I do blame myself for quite a lot, I do not blame myself for wanting to die. This world really fucking sucks. I have no hope for society in general - late-stage capitalism and climate change are the terminal cancer of humanity, and I am sure that it is people like me that are going to suffer the worst deaths.I cannot say I have not tried to get better. I have had aloof unsympathetic therapists over the years who have prescribed me medicine I end up not being able to afford. But I still tried. Yesterday, I called down a list 20 therapists covered by my insurance the other day to see if they were accepting new patients and not one of them called me back. I guess I just really do not believe anyone is really equipped, capable, or willing to help me out of this.The obstacles keeping me from killing myself are insurmountable, like knowing the effect it would have on my family, my cat, and the lack of a riskless/painless method. So for now, I guess I am just stuck in this unbearable existence. Being able to kill myself is just as ludicrous of a goal as me finding any level of real or sustainable happiness. I do not know what to do with that other than writhe in agony until my natural time comes. Hell is real, and I am here. the definition of hell",Suicidal
7745,"I cried for the first time in years, the summer class i depended on told me i was not eligible and i could not follow the course anymore after two weeks of learning i enjoyed. My school functions on a modular system which is extremely flawed towards students with undiagnosed ADHD and little autonomy. I love learning but my school does not have teachers, we have modules, 60-130 pages of self-learning. This system where students advance at their own pace is a nightmare for people with un medicated ADHD like me. In part to why i loved my summer class so much was because the teacher would talk to you and guide you through the subject. I wish i had changed schools earlier in my highschool career, its too late for all that. Being a maximum one year behind was my goal and i would have reached it if i had finished 8th grade science when i was 14. In 9th grade they removed my science and social studies subjects to focus on the more ""important"" ones, same for 10th grade. Why would they do this if you need them to graduate? I have planned suicide this whole year, delaying it with the thought that if i finish this summer class i will only have to do two years in one. My second option now gone, I have never been closer to sneaking out and jumping off an abandoned parking lot nearby. I have hit a dead end. I will not graduate and I will not go to college. i will be 16 doing 8th grade science. putting me 3 years behind.",Suicidal
7746,I had a belt tight around my neck twice last night and seemed really motivated to kill myself. I must have punched myself in the head 15 times last night. Thankfully I did not go through with it but it really feels like just a matter of time. My wife and I drink and smoke weed every night and during the day on weekends. Admittedly we are very functional addicts but mentally it is really taking a toll on me. I cannot seem to communicate with her about this though as she gets really upset when I bring up a desire to stop. We often go through stages where we fight all the time and then go long stretches where its all good. I hate myself so much for what I have become and yet I cannot seem to find the motivation to actually make a change for myself. Instead just wishing it changes on its own. Even killing myself I often wish it would just happen like getting hit by a car or something. How awful is that? I am so lazy and lately I cannot even look at myself in the mirror anymore. We have a beautiful daughter who is growing and developing incredibly well so far and I hate the idea of her not knowing her father. At the same time I hate to think of her knowing her parents as scum. Maybe if I kill myself it will shock my wife into cleaning up and then our daughter can thrive with a sober parent. At the same time maybe that is just me trying to rationalize a selfish act so I do not feel as bad. I keep wishing I was a better person and yet never taking any action. I am the only one that can make a change. It does not just happen but I am too lazy and pathetic to actually do anything. Someday it will happen and the thoughts will stop. I am just looking to get this off of my chest - please disregard,Suicidal

7760,"My names Joey. Ever since about 4th grade I have had anxiety because my teacher was a total prick and he would yell at the class and be mentally abusive as fuck to us. So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

7761,"Hi, I always wanted to talk here but never did. I have depression since age of 10, I am 18 years old. I lost a huge amount of my memory power, like if I have dementia, it is the most annoying shit. Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it. And he just ran away and hid from me everyday in school. So anyway, that is it, I will go listen to Soundgarden, Joy Division and Misfits all day, like always. Bye Fear of the D(eath)ark.",Depression

7770,"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life",Depression
7776,"I plan to die around the end of November, I know what date I am going to do it and I have some ideas on how I am going to die. I chose November because my big important essay is due, and I do not want to waste my effort from writing the first and second drafts. Another reason is because I was suppose to die on the same day a few years ago but I had to go somewhere.I have been feeling like shit for years, especially this summer. My old therapist ( last meeting was 3 years ago, 9th grade, first suicide attempt ) gave me meds that did not even work ( 50mg and only 8 tablets, and its fucking expensive ) and his last advice was to ""have fun"". Yeah thanks a lot. I have been coping in a really bad way, but I do not know if I am ready to give it up.School-wise I am doing fine, but my parents are hell-bent on making me go to college in my home country ( because the school gave me the wrong term 3 results ) and I do not want to go there because of its conservative laws and I have views that can get me killed or shunned, a shit ton of victim-blaming and overall I just want to go far away from my parents because they treat me like I am 5. My mom insists that I stay at home and go to online-school when I am in college, and it made everything worse. I said to myself ""I would rather kill myself than be with them"" I do not know what major I want to be in, I just want to move out. I do not know why, but this subreddit makes me feel safe for telling all of this. I do not know where to get better advice.

7779,"I want to make some things clear first. English is not my native language (I am not from English-speaking country) so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general (if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it). Also, my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title, I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either, not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said, I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that, while still affecting me in a negative matter, I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture, not much else.1. I 100% have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well, not only this, actually, but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction, which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it, so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like, absolutely no one, even online. It makes things harder, but I learned to accept it, and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue, I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on, here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice on:I am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now, and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 1-2 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family (but no one is able to fix it), mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer, having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation, though she still needs to be in a hospital every 3-4 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital, but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other, he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well, hearing all that, I do not seem to be a good person, right? Like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes, and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either, I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school, I thought I would kill myself, but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes, I am an egoist. I want to live by myself, for myself, alone. In a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50% of my income to my family if the other 50% can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What, is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. Like, what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment, not really loud (I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this). And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax, I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like, I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice",Depression
7781,"21M. So. I have been feeling depressed, very anxious and very low the past while. I grew up in a abusive household until I was 18, I moved in with my sister for 3 years and that turned toxic and it did not work out (she was angry, hatred, thinks she still hates me), I moved into student accommodation yesterday and I am still overwhelmed and depressed. I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation.

7792,"Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself.

7793,"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)",Depression
7796,"Feels like the an episode of a soap opera, but the title pretty much sums it up.I am 24 now, and started attending university at 18. At 19 I got Pyloric Stenosis which went undiagnosed for nearly 6 months, I lost 49% of my body weight, and due to the impeccable timing, missed both the first year final exams, and the retakes due to illness. During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI, my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours, and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior (she survived luckily).It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder, and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to, they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did, and had an incredible time, got to travel to other counties to tour, was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify (huge personal victory) and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life. However, I have diagnosed ADHD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia, Depression and Anxiety, book smarts just is not my forte, but I usually get by, until a global pandemic happens and I had to do my final year at home in my bedroom, this was my kryptonite, but I was still moving along fine. Up until about an hour ago, my father was taken to hospital by ambulance last Monday, traumatic stuff but we have a family history of being unwell constantly so I managed to not let it drop me getting these final pieces done. He called about an hour ago to tell me they were finally able to get a better understanding of what happened and confirm it is Lung Cancer.I do not know why is was the final straw but I have no idea how to handle this new level of nothingness My Dad just got diagnosed with cancer 22 hours before my final deadline for my degree",Depression

7804,"Things were better than good they were great. I spent 14 months, happy, for the first time in 29 years I actually had a happy period in my life, I was sorting stuff out, wed spoke of a future together, a family, Id been talking to a life counsellor and even became optimistic and started letting go of bad moments to keep my mind clear day to day.I drove over to hers after getting some good news that would enable our future, Id made up my mind where Id take her to propose next year, and then that was that. She did not see a future for us.I have barely slept or ate. I keep taking diphenhydramine to try to sleep but I am just taking more and more now to try and not have to deal with the mess inside my head, and still not sleeping. I am heartbroken, and I think this is leading back to the depression that plagued me before. I keep thinking I am soon to be 30, and I have nothing, no one. Everything in my life I have either pissed away or subconsciously ruined.I hate the person I see in the mirror.I keep thinking what is the point to carry on, but I do not even think I could manage going through with anything, let alone even talk to anyone about it - I just feel like I am pathetic for feeling like this.

It makes us both really happy, but secretly I feel so guilty deep down because I know its very likely that all those dreams are going to come crashing down when I snap and decide to get it done once and for all. We did talk about having kids but I am afraid I will pass on my mental issues (not sure if they are genetic or not because I was abused as a child for about a decade) and also I would hate to create whole new people and then crush them by killing myself AFTER they are born. He keeps telling me that he will never be normal again if I do go ahead with it, but I am so FUCKING EXHAUSTED. One failed attempt last year and I am still here on this shit earth.

7812,So i just got hit by an odd feeling. I am crying but I feel kind of chill &amp; peaceful. Colors seem more alive. And i just want to die. I realized that I am just a fucking useless Borden(i cannot spell it and i coulnd t care less rn) I have prepared everything. I know how where when. But i just want to say fuck google. I am trying to look up what the fuck am i feeling and why is it like this but all i get is how to recognize symptoms or how to help someone with suicidal thoughts or something like that. I tried phrasing it but it does not search what I want. I may be just dumb but i had a fucking rampage scrolling.So why everything seems pretty all of a sudden. Why am I crying like an idiot. And why i just know what I want to do for once in life. I feel like walking to my destination. And walking. And walking. there is a fucking storm coming and idc. I am afraid of storms but i feel safe. And i already prepared everything. And idk if I should give a tiny warning to my friends. Or should I just go. I feel like thanking but they might suspect something. Idk honestly.

(never felt that before but I was on ssri the last few years). Now I feel mild symptoms of my depression coming back. I can still do my daily tasks, do sports, eat healthy and other activities but they are not as fun anymore and my job starts to annoy me so much.I really struggle to find out if these feelings are just normal since I am going through a stressfull phase and have not been able to experience these feelings as I do now because I was on medication, or if I am just depressed again and maybe need it.Has anyone else experienced something like this?

I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life. it is all I was thinking of. I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling. The medication has done nothing but put two stone of weight on me so now I feel even more crap about myself. I am in a dark hole and only I can pull myself out.

7832,"This is literally the first time I am opening up somewhere, and not denying my miserable mental health. I am a 19 year old teen, and went through a painful breakup 11 months ago. I was completely fine and confident before that - a nice social group of friends that I made almost everywhere I went. People used to compliment me for my good looks and charm and it made me more confident. However after the breakup things started going downhill. I am not sure if it is the lockdown and quarantine that made me this way.I literally hate meeting people now. People give me anxiety. I force myself to attend meetup plans made by some 4-5 friends that are left. I feel tired to pick up calls from friends, my phone stays on silent all the time. I do not open social media at all and even if I do, all the messages I get are left unanswered. I cannot even do daily chores which involve interacting with people like going to the shop to buy groceries or visiting the barber. Somehow, I push myself to do it. I want to join the gym and start working out again but I am afraid of all the other people at the gym. I am well over my ex girlfriend and do not feel anything about her or the breakup. But , I do refrain from meeting our old mutual friends. My sleep schedule is messed up, I sleep at 1:30 am and wake up at 10:30 am. Previously, I was diagnosed with migraine. Now that I stay at home all day I do not get them. But socialising or going out gives me stress migraines. I know this is not normal and I want to get out of all this. This is a genuine cry for help. About my life goals, I do have a serious passion for Physics and Astronomy. But I end up spending most of my time playing video games.

7836,"Man, when I thought these months were going good, nope it was preparing me for this 2 weeks before I felt on top of the world, nothing could stop me. I was getting over my health anxiety and was ready. I was also about to score a new job and leave this cruddy one. It was all going good, until the next week. I found out that the job I was taking was a total scam. Fine, time to just wait it out and try some online freelancing (fyi first time). Oh look a job opportunity! Nope two more scams that further irritated me (fun). Fine, I guess I will try to hang out with some fiends. I call a few people and text (no response for days). Now I am starting to feel the partial feeling of depression. Next thing I know, my school work began to pile up and was now behind (awesome!) But the funny thing is, the week ended okay for me that is until Sunday. Without any explanation whatsoever, my ex(who hated my guts after I broke up with her but I was cool with) dmed me months after our last talk. Ok, I am not upset or angry at her, she changed alot and is happy with her new bf (something I was hoping she would get) but this was the match to light the fuel. After taking to her, I began to see how much good stuff she is gone through the years and I (should not have done this) mistakenly started comparing her life to mine. that is where I took a total fall. I immediately blocked her because I was jeleous of her new life(mind you I wished for her happiness) because I was so insecure at the time. Luckily she dmed me in a unblocked account and that is how I found out i was not inheritly mad at her. Now I am just at the bottom of my life. I feel burnt out and just lost a good deal of hope.

I have a few really bad days where I feel like though I want to get my work done, I am unable to as I have no motivation and I just want to lie down or sleep.

I am confused, anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since I am on meds, I am able to have a little control over my emotions.I think I had Depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. Which reinforces my doubt that maybe I am faking depression as I can use it as an excuse as I am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe I like to stay in depression so I do not have to do any work. But at the same time I never tell anyone at work that I am depressed so maybe I am not faking after all. Everything is so confusing.

7851,"So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means, if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was, that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me, other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live, Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did, movies, TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else ( of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything) I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend, our classmate, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy ( not the one I love ) told me ( because he could see that I had been struggling ) : ,,The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it."" and then the guy I loved said : ,,We are telling everything to each other. Tell us."" And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. ( for the sake of this the guy I love is : T and his best friend is : S)At one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying, exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance, when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 ( which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him ). I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. ( Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot ). S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S "" fooled around "" with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend ( M ) She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln't continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing, negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? "" Michael, are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you?"" Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that "" get some help"" because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists, psychiatrists, telling friends, group therapies, fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind, tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here",Depression
7853,"Yesterday was the straw for me. My councillor had already advised me to try them because I just keep spiralling, getting a boost from our session and then it all going out the window before the next session. I do not have any fuel for the fire, I think there is something biological going on. After a vicious breakup and being just unable to make any ground for the last 7 months. Struggling with the constant voices in my head, minor jobs just being overwhelming have been the run of the mill.But yesterday I flat out insulted a close friend. The only one who had really been there for me. He got a girlfriend just as I lost mine. I am full of bitterness and resentment. I have always been a good mate, never want to step on toes. It was completely out of character and like watching a car crash in slow motion. Trying to push people away out of fear? Out of mercy because I think I am just draining to know? I have no idea.I verbally attacked him and his girlfriend who I have never met. Even talked shit because she had a kid with some else after they split and he went running back and looks after someone elses kid.But anyway, called the doctor today. Got some anti depressants to hopefully help. Really scared of losing my libido, but the horniness and want for my ex has also been torture. So maybe not a bad thing? Just less on my mind hopefully. Got my anti depressants. Absolutely dreading it.",Depression
7854,"Hey everyone I apologise for the triggers I know it is sort of against the rules but I really need to let some stuff out. do not read if you get triggered easilyI really need some help. After being closeted for about 7 years, I told my parents who I still live with that I am nonbinary (I am 19 and Amab if that helps)They did say it was okay. They are fine with make up and accessories. They do not want me to dress how I want because of my little brother who is almost 10. I feel like I cannot fully be me and I feel so trapped. I just feel like I cannot fully embrace me. it is bad enough that I cannot go to work how I want (I am a auto mechanic they would rip me to shreds) and I do not have anyone to do it with because I broke up with my girlfriend because of how she was treating me. My friends all ditched me during my toxic relationship.I am just sick of feeling confined to my room. They are forcing me to wait 3 years before I can but by then I will not be as young any more and have more scars. My teeth are already going to shit. My backs getting worse. I have been only sleeping for around 3 hours a night regularly. I just want to be me. The breakup and stressful job is not helping too.I am over all the heart ache I have felt. I have been hung, I have been bashed for hours, I have been burnt, I have self mutilated, I have been called so many names under the sun at work, at school, by my own father. And all I want is to feel pretty because I have been through so much shitty stuff, work so hard to the point I ingest shit tons of chemicals out of necessity my arms are so cut and bruised.I cannot even get that?!?! All because of my brother. Because they are scared of him saying something to his friends then him getting bullied or him being influenced by me..... I am just so over life atm I do not even feel like myself, I am in pain all the time, I do not sleep any more, I am always stressing. I really just want to be me. I am so confused about me and my girlfriend right now. My cars are falling apart. Thank you if you read this, I am really struggling if anyone could leave a bit of advice I would appreciate it so much. I feel like I need to do something to fix all of my life.... it is a mess....

7855,"So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really, finally worked. I have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and C-PTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much, I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP - Holy shit.",Depression
7856,"it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually (though not easily). I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university (I am 21 now) and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.Since I am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time I disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like ""you should just go die"" ""your dad does not want you anymore"" or ""it is all your fault"" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago, I found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me (though I had a long day). I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition, I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. (it is another question which I always ponder at, whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day)Then recently, I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like ""why do you have to make a big fuss"" ""you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument"", etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after, till today, I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, I hope the grammar is not too bad. Thanks all I think I have depression but I am not sure, can anybody help?",Depression

Also I am becoming more and more apathetic; I cannot feel more affection for anyone...I can only feel hatred and indifference towards other people, even those I loved them.

7863,"I am a 15M. I smoke weed as a way to cope with my anxiety and depression that gets worse at night. I also use it as a way to fall asleep easier. My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed, he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do, but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now, my dad is also having troubles with my mom, and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry, he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort, he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father, which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is, a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person, something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not, I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city, I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends, my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young, I do not know why I am feeling this way, it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal, nothing really even matter anymore.

I remember how full of life she was. She was a ray of light and sunshine, and I am reminded how dark and empty her eyes now are. Her sleepless nights are leaving their trail under her eyes. The loss of appetite has diminished her wardrobe, all the clothes she used to love to wear- now fall off her body. I am reminded she is empty and the walls are caving in.

7916,"Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this.

But it just makes me wonder, how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now, if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless, and I wonder, if everything falls appart again, will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again.

7922,I have been enduring this for too long and got no one to talk to. I literally just made a reddit account just to have somebody to talk to me. I need help or advice or idk just help me tf out of this. I am so confused and mad right now. I do not even know what to say. I already planned how to end it all and was already done writing my last note. Idk who to blame. Actually no. I think I am the one to blame. I have been a very temperant and easily irritated person. Making everyone in the family dislike me. And also i have not been doing good at school. Not because I am dumb but i just do not see the point at all. My parents have been comparing me to anyone they see that is better than me (basically everyone lol). I also dislike me. Idk how i became like this tbh. it is like I am always mad and not interested. I am rlly tired of this. Waking up just to sleep. I cannot remember of a day that I am not imagining my death. Or idk maybe I am being dramatic. Either way I am rlly tired of everything and confused. that is all. I am sorry this post is kind of messy. it is just my thoughts at the moment and I am just rlly confused. Help me please. I do not know what to do. And i already want to end it all.,Suicidal
7924,"Gee I never thought about that. you are absolutely right, I spend days at a time feeling like this because I want to. I absolutely want to kill myself for funsies. Its definitely not a crippling feeling of helplessness and despair. As a matter of fact, I will get rid of my asthma by just breathing. I will get over my pollen allergies by simply not sneezing. I will take all my ailments and get rid of them by just doing the opposite of what they prevent me from doing. Thank you so much for curing my depression. Seriously, I fucking hate ""just be happy!"" People with a passion. It feels like they are just blaming you for your depression because you do not want to be happy enough and they bestow this knowledge on you like its something brand fucking new. Maybe I am overanalyzing it but even still I wish people understood it more. Maybe if people made an effort to understand we would have a ""cure"" or something right now. But for now we are stuck with people with perfect lives and pristine mental health telling us to just not suffer from chemical imbalances. ""Just go out and be happy! Go do things you like! Enjoy your youth!""",Depression
7930,"This is kind of just ganna be a thought dump I guess, but its something I need to put somewhere so it is not festering in my head.I do not really understand myself anymore. I have not in a really long time, I do not even remember a time where I could accurately describe how I am feeling. There are times when I am with friends or by myself and I do not necessarily feel happy but distracted and I like that. I have heard people say, ""I keep myself busy, I do not give myself the time to be sad"" but its just more complicated than that. It is not just sadness; its anger, self-hate, and a strange emptiness I cannot describe. Even when I am out with people, speaking with them, even when I am distracting myself with some type of work, there is just this sense of hollowness.I used to be the type of person that thought things would always work out. One way or another, they had to right? They do, until they just do not anymore. Nothing works the same, and realistically I know that is because of me. There are moments, just the briefest instants of motivation I have to force things to work out. To really put shit in place and buck the fuck up, ya know? And then it just disappears and I am just at such a loss. I do not remember when I first thought it, but sometimes things just do not work out. I realized something was not right a few years ago. I have thought about death since middle school, really considered it hard but I would snap out of those funks pretty easily back then. Up until I was 20, I figured I did not think about suicide anymore than the next guy or girl. Besides what did I have to complain about? There are people that are much worse off. I was working at a bingo place at the time and was just so mentally down. I had this little post-it note that I wrote a ton of things on, they were basically ways that I would off myself if I ever had the chance to. It was meant to be kind of like an angry letter, you write it and then throw it away. Some closure or dumb shit like that. Well my manager found it and we had a pretty awkward talk. She was kind of a hard ass, the type to just bug the hell out of you over really small thing, but there were times where she was really nice. That was one of those times. Anyway, I told her that there was nothing to worry about I was just 'in a mood'. She did not tell anyone, thank fucking god, but its where I learned that thinking like that was not actually normal. I do not work there anymore, I quit not long after that. It was just too strange for me. I felt like there was always this strange look in her eye after that. I wonder if she would show up to my funeral. there is honestly a lot more I would like to share, but I do not want to make this any longer or stupid than it already is so I will wrap it up. I want to see a doctor, I need to see a doctor but they are so fucking expensive. I want medication, BUT I cannot GET IT. I do not want to feel like this anymore. I do not want to look up how I can die painlessly anymore. I do not want to debate how much longer I want to give myself anymore. I wish I lived in Sweden or somewhere that had euthanasia, that is not as scary as a gun and a rope. I want to fix my brain.I am sorry. I know stuff like this does not really help those that feel the same, but I needed to put it somewhere. I needed to exist beyond my house. I am not posting this for sympathy or pity, just for me and me alone. The same way people carve their names in trees. Although, this is much longer than a name. my brain",Suicidal
7932,"I am about to turn 18 and I am not ready. I never planned on getting this far, living this long. That selfish desire to end it all is still there but I am too afraid to do it. I look back at 15 year old me, feeling almost the exact same way, and wish I would had the guts to do it then. If I had not taken years to dwell on it, years in which I have acheived absolutely nothing, done absolutely nothing, I might have been able to rest and find peace so much sooner. I felt like I have not slept in years, my relationship with food is only more horrendous and the only thing that forces me outside is an exercise addiction. Whatever momentary happiness I might feel when I watch a good film, or see a fox in the evening, does not make any of this worth it. I have not felt true joy in so long, I do not think I even remember what it means to actually enjoy life.I have completely wasted my teenage years. I have spent them inside for the most part, isolating myself from people and trying to sort myself out on my own. I cut people off, and other people got bored and left, and now my only good friends live thousands of miles away and I will probably never even get to meet them. I know this is my fault, and I should have tried harder to connect with people, but I just could not. It felt impossible to hold onto those who mattered. Now I watch them all, on Instagram, going about their lives and having a great time, and I am so happy for them, but I am also so selfishly jealous. That happiness they have is all I have ever wanted. If I could throw away everything I have, but be free from mental illness, I would do it in a heartbeat. I am so exhausted. I do not even know what I am doing anymore. I am about to turn 18 and I have wasted my teenage years",Depression
7934,"I was born with meth in my system,my mom was going to abort me but my step-dad decided to intervene.My biological dad that I have never met was a depressive loser with a little dick and I inherited everything from him but his tallness.I grew up homeless essentially,we got to stay at my great grandmas house alot,but the majority of my childhood was spent in my step dads Chevy k5 blazer.Throughout my life I always moved,whenever I would make friends and gain a connection,we would leave,it left me numb and unable to form relationships, with the abject poverty and constant drinking,partying,domestic violence every night, and a mom that never hid anything from me, I had to grow up quickly. By 10 years old I had already told myself that I was ready to die, not that I wanted to,but I was ready.This made me really unrelatable to my peers,I acted like a little old man and never got to experience a normal childhood.By my high-school years everybody thought I was a crackhead because I was always nervous,my clothes were dirty,and I never had good shoes, this led to me accepting that I was a loner,but I am full of social desire.All this made me really cold and unfeeling on the outside,I am really bad at expressing my emotions and anytime someone is fighting or in an argument I revert to the same frozen state of my childhood.Fast forward to now,I am 20 years old and I am the only source of income in my family,my step-dad has been in prison for 3 years on a 15 year bid. My mom has alot of health problems but even so she refuses to work or get disability,her constant drinking worries me.my 16 year old sister lost her mentor when her dad went away,these last few years she has been following my mom's mold,smoking cigarettes,dropping out of school,doing nothing.I work 48 hours a week and when I come home I am 100% occupied by serving others, I have no future, no personality, no ambition, I do not even have my license yet,I am just spinning in circles going through a deep cycle of depression and coping mechanisms.I am fat and short,have an odd shaped body and just generally ugly, I have no redeeming qualities physically,I cannot stand to look at myself in the mirror,or work up the courage to find a GF and be loved,but I get awkward around girls I like and make things weird.I have no purpose.No place on this earth I bought really sharp knives on Amazon, but I do not want to be in pain and reflect on my life as I lie bleeding out,I am waiting to get a gun so I can just do a quick shot to the head and get I over with,no more bad thoughts,no more missing the countless friends I have left behind in the 30+ schools I went to as a kid,no more pain, no more me.

I have adhd and generalized anxiety disorder.I did not make many friends because of my crippling self hatred and insecurity. I preferred to be alone.Yeah I hushed that fear by thinking everything would come to me by itself. I was raised a very lucky kid. I think that is why I thought it would all be ok, like everything up until like 25.We had a beautiful house in a very nice neighborhood, a second house, could practice anything we wanted, never had to worry etc. I would say my parents are kind of elitist.

7937,"Lately life has not been the best for me , I have been avoiding my family and ignoring their phone calls because I just do not want to talk. I miss family events because I do not want them to see me and ask why I am not okay. Everyday I wake up a wave of grief and depression just wash over me and I hate it. Everyday of my life is a battle and I am getting closer to my edge. I feel like my life is going no where and that the best thing for me to do is just end it all , I obviously did not succeed in this life therefore there is no point in being around just existing without a purpose. I try to talk to my mom and to my brother but they do not understand, they think its not as serious but they have no idea the turmoil and pain that goes on in my mind. I have so much PTSD from my life. In 2018 my grandpa , cousin and brother all died. My brother was killed by his friend on his own daughters birthday and my cousin was murdered at a red light in Los Angeles. that is not even the tip of the iceberg. Throughout my life I have lost so many friends and family to gun violence and I hate it. I grew up going to funerals and seeing my loved ones die young . I feel like I have the same fate in store for me and I am just waiting for the day to come . I never liked living in this world and feeling all this pain and having no one to talk to . It just sits in my head all day . I know no ones going to see this but I just wanted to get this off my chest. Sorry for bothering.

Every time she thinks about me, she cannot accept the fact that what she did was wrong. But people will defend her. She was manipulated and abused I know her well, well enough to know that even now when she touches her self she thinks about him, the memories they had, how good it felt, the rush and excitement. And deep down she does not regret it. I cannot stand the fact that in her story, the one who loved her. I am the bad guy.

7941,"I am 18. I cannot even bear a thought to even live anymore. Everything has been taken away from me. When I was small I was sexually abused by my cousins multiple times. I have told my parents but they shut me by saying that I am lying. I am still confused about how a 4-year-old child will lie. I was abused till the age of 10. Till now i stutter to talk to older men. Then I work way up in my studies. Even got declared as a good student in my district at the age of 11, but I manage to get only 6A 1B in my UPSR. (UPSR is a Malaysian-based examination for students at the age of 12). I did not lose hope and studied hard. In class teachers used to praise me being a smart student but only to get lower marks in exams. I do not know what is wrong with me and my examinations. Then PT3 happen and I got 6A 4B. I got into science streams. 2019 was the worst year for me would be an understatement. I was accused of cheating, stealing stuff by a teacher. I was removed as the head prefect of my school and president of the red crescent society of my school. I was falling into depression. I started to skip classes. Thoughts of hurting myself have always been in my mind. At the end of 2019, all the accusations thrown at me were proven wrong but people still treated me like I am some kind of a bad person. I just want everything to end but my friends always stop me. So in my last year of high school, I studied hard, despite the pandemic. I worked my ass off. My friends were worried about me. I just wanted to get out of my house and pursue my dream job. I wanted to become a doctor. In The SPM examination, I got 7A 3B, and 2C. ( The Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia, or the Malaysian Certificate of Education, is a national examination taken by all fifth-form secondary school students in Malaysia. ) I was exictied and thrilled, except for my parents who were angry that i got 3B and 2C. Well i applied for Matriculation in my country. Unfortunately, I did not get in bcuz my country has this quota system where only 90 % of Bumiputera ( Bumiputra is a Malaysian term to describe the Malay race and other indigenous peoples of Southeast Asia, and used particularly in Malaysia. ) while only 10% of Non-Bumi are allowed despite being a citizen of malaysia. I was very disapointed. I wanted to pursue A levels but my family denied. So i went for the second best option STPM, ( STPM is a pre-university examination in Malaysia. ). I got in science stream and i was happy. I later found out my parents have changed my stream to arts as they want me to become a lawyer. I wanted to become a doctor. When i ask the school administrators for advice they told me i cannot do anything. Nothing can be changed. I feel numb. I feel the world has stopped. I feel nothing is meaningful anymore. I feel my life has ended. I wanted to end all of this paain. I cannot bare anymore. I do not want my friends to feel guilty that its their fault. i just want to dissapear. I cannot handdle this pain and toture. i just want to pursue my dream but there is no other way. I feel i am going to hurt myself. I do not know what to do.

They made me feel nauseous and gave me headaches. I also went through an episode of unexplained joint and bone pains, that made me lay on bed and cry from the pain. I have trouble sleeping.

7946,"Severe content warning for mentions of eating disorders and emotional abuse.I have had binge eating disorder for as long as I can remember. Ever since I was a child, I would eat large amounts of food to cope with stress, as I have been in an abusive household my whole life. I have always known this was a problem, and I have tried to lose weight, but my eating habits feel uncontrollable. they have caused many problems, and in 2019, I was diagnosed with morbid obesity.I knew my problems were getting more grave than ever, and my parents rather than trying to help in any way, have scolded me, yelled at me and denied it being related to my mental health, and even denied that I had any mental health problems.It was not until late 2020 where they started taking my mental health even remotely seriously as I had a severe depressive episode that resulted in me not eating. I then got a professional counselor, and I was diagnosed with depression, general anxiety, and PTSD. I was prescribed prozac/fluoxetine to help with this. Even after getting therapy and professional help, my eating habits have not changed. Fluoexetine has also helped me gain more weight.Recently I have been struggling to breathe. Whenever I realized that my health has gotten this bad, I started bawling. I started to feel like my days are limited and that I am going to die before I could turn things around.Truly, I do not want to die. I have many friends I care for dearly and I want to at least live somewhat of a life for myself and escape my abusive home. However, I do not know if I will be able to make things better for myself, and I looked up the costs of oxygen, in which costs more a day than my family makes per month. Making me feel like I have no other options than to die slowly and painfully or by my own hands. tl;dr: I have had horrible eating habits since childhood that my abusive family has refused to get me help for it for a long time that have gotten so bad that they have resulted in breathing problems, and I cannot afford medical help so I feel as if all I can do is die slowly or end my own life myself.

7963,"that is normal. Not. I have always hated myself and my life so much ever since i was a kid. Suicidal thoughts ever since i was a kid. It just gets worse the more i age. I am quite broken. My mind tormented and plagued by past trauma and existential crises. it is so appealing to escape the suffering of life and the suffering of my mind. I was planning to travel to some places i really wanted to see before i die. Like the pyramids and the great wall of china. But now I am wondering, why bother. I feel a bit like a coward in not wanting to go through with a painful suicide method like hanging. I just want to leave this world peacefully. I am not sure which method yet. Some kind of gas probably, that is always been one of the main ones i have been interested in. But there is still quite a bit of preparation you need to do for this method like obtaining the gas and then setting up the method. Whether an exit bag or something. Exit bag sounded good, but looking at people in them it seems a bit morbid now. Like your last moments of vision will be in a bag. I am not sure.

Here lately, it is just not been bringing me joy. My last two sessions I was suppose to have, have been canceling last minute after me spending money on props that they wanted. People taking advantage of my work. Being mean about things. And I am lacking confident in my work for some reason.

She constantly compares our arms and saying mine was bigger than hers. That i have too many stretch marks. She always tells me that when I am an adult I would thank her for all that she is saying and i would regret my body so much. She just told me i was gaining a flabby big lower belly and i should immediately exercise. My dad is a bit better but i think that is only because we do not talk much, only a couple of times a week and 50% of our conversation is just him reminding me of how fat i am and how I would die of obesity. My sister tells me to 'just lose weight' as if i do not want to already. she is been skinny her whole life even when she eats even more than I do. It just feels like she is mocking me.I want to work on myself and i really do want to change.

I hope that people who says 'losing weight is easy if you just put your mind to it' sees this. I KNOW I am fat. I know i need to lose weight. I know myself and my body more than you do. I deal with more than just my weight. It comes with extreme self loathing, anxiety, and even depression. The mental burden we deal with cannot be easily cured by losing weight.

7996,"I honestly do not know.I do not know if contemplating suicide as an option relentlessly makes me suicidal or not.I do not know what would happen if I committed suicide.What I do know is that I want to commit suicide, because damn, life is hard. Soaking up everyone elses emotions is hard. Feeling like you are too young to die is hard.Losing those that you have called friends is hard. Cutting contact is hard. Being called indecisive and unable to say goodbye and move on is hard. Being ignored is hard. Being in a relationship, romantic or otherwise, is hard.I have had really bad experiences in the past. One of who I thought were my closest buddies gaslighted me for years. I was always bullied and ignored. I have recently moved to another school and things have been easier, but I am afraid to trust anyone, so I have been pushing people away because the easier it is to convince myself that I am not their friend makes it easier when I mess up and the relationship burns down. And I have dropped hints everywhere that I want support but nobody ever noticed. Even going to a therapist is hard because I do not trust the therapist enough to tell her anything about how I am feeling because that information invariably ends up in my parents hand. And I do not trust my parents with a single atom in my body. Because some part of teenage me does not trust adults. Because I do not want anyone to worry about me, because in the end this is my burden to carry.So yeah. I have been contemplating suicide. I have even written a draft of a letter to share with certain people I have once felt even remotely close to trusting. I have been getting no sleep at all lately.

8011,"I have been with my partner for nearly 3 yrs now and we have never once had sex, hes been really patient with me. While we have never had vaginal intercourse we have done other things, and I sometimes struggle with depression bringing down my libido. But for weeks now I have been struggling having any sort of intimacy with him. Last time I broke down crying as we made out with his body over me, he did not notice as the lights were out. And he began to move his hands and the combination of anxiety and fear of him feeling my cuts (started self harming recently) made me run, I left immediately and told him I could not do it. Prior to that I have had tears run down before but this time it was more and I felt as if I was suffocating. I love him, and I am attracted to him but when this happens it feels like I am not there, almost like I am just watching myself but I have no control over my body. I know I can tell him to stop at any moment but it feels as if I am mute and cannot bring myself to do so. He does not even know I struggle with depression, no one does, he just thinks I am saving myself or waiting for the right time. We were relatively young when we started dating as well so it makes sense that we have not had any relations during the 3 yrs. its scary when I disassociate, I know hes someone I trust and love but it feels like rape in a way. I am not comparing the two but I do feel powerless, and its not even his fault. I cannot be intimate",Depression
8013,"I currently live in the you.S. with my mother and my partner is from Poland. I would like to move in with them but it is a huge step that has given me a lot of anxiety. I think its time for me to commit to the decision or else I will end my life.I currently live with my mother. she is quite abusive in a few ways and she constantly controls my life. I am a gamer so of course I love to game and I can spend a lot of time on that. My anxiety and depression is preventing me from being able to continue college. I had to drop out after one semester due to it causing me to attempt suicide. I still do not feel ready to go back. I am 19 and due to the fact that I live under my mothers roof its unfortunately her house and her rules. I do not know if she means well the majority of the time. She says she wants the best for me and wants me to be something in life but just because I am not going to college right now does not mean I will never go, I am just not ready. She constantly takes her anger out on me and never apologizes. I often feel uncomfortable living with her and stay locked alone in my room. She gets upset if I sleep in late but that is my choice because I am not feeling well. I often stay up late and sleep in late, why should it matter to her?My experience with therapy has been awful. It took me contacting 10 therapists to even get one response. During therapy I have just been judged and my issues compared with others, and it has never helped. I had one psychiatrist tell me to just stop gaming completely when I use it to cope with how shit life is. My psychiatrist told me yesterday that my partner will leave me for being useless and not having a job. She also told me that if my mother were to die Id be taken advantage of and used in the system. It feels so fucked up that she would say those things to me. All I could do was cry. If I am being honest, I wanted to shout fuck you and punch her, but I somehow had restraint not to do that.I am 19. I have a lot left to life (and honestly I fucking hope I do not but Ill just say that because of reality) and just because I do not have a job nor am attending college now does not mean I am worthless. I do not understand why my life has to be controlled and I have to be forced to do things I am not ready for. College makes me suicidal, and so does my mother. I feel like its time to move out.The reason I am coming here to post about this is because is it really the right choice? I know there will be yes and nos, but I want to hear what others opinions are. I have been with my partner for just over 2 years and I have been thinking about this major decision for over a year. It gives me quite a bit of anxiety. I have never been to Poland, but we have met twice (would have been more if it were not due to the pandemic). I do not have anywhere else to go. My family is toxic as hell and none of my friends really have space for me to be there. I also will not be able to bring my cats with me if I choose to go. it will be a huge lifestyle change too. My partner has constantly reassured me that they will take care of me and I will have time to improve my mental health before I start making any big steps into the work force or college. Honestly, I feel like Id feel more comfortable doing things if I was there with them, because I love them and I am comfortable with them. I just do not know if making a drastic change to a different country will be worth it in the long run. I do want to move away from my mother but its so far and its so different. I do not want to judge. I just hope that I will be happy if I make that choice, even though I know it will be a lot of stress and anxiety. I am hoping that it will improve my mental health in the long run and allow me to actually be able to control my life and be able to breathe. Maybe Ill actually find a competent therapist and psychiatrist there that are not pieces of shit.I am writing this calm as fuck right now but in reality my brain is spinning. I do not want to go back to my piece-of-shit psychiatrist in a week. If I cannot move out, I genuinely will kill myself, and I feel like moving is the better choice because knowing me Id fail and turn into a vegetable. : )I genuinely do want to die all the time, but I feel like if I can actually enjoy life it would be worthwhile staying at the same time.

I have a disorganised attachment style. Meaning I am pulled between desperately wanting affection (anxious) to not wanting any affection at all and wanting to just end the relationship because I feel its an attack on my independence (avoidant) he said he loves me and will wait for me. I said I will only need a few weeks or a month or something to get myself together. I just feel locked in, like I am so young and will be with this person forever. Hes perfect for me. When I was feeling suicidal once he took 2 days off work to be with me to make sure I am okay. Hes a good communicator, he cares and loves me. there is no drama as I am used to in other relationships. So anyway, the night I broke up with him I got insanely drunk and ended up going to a former FWB house and had sex with him. I also messaged one of my co workers for sex.. so embarrassing because hes the type that will tell EVERYONE at work and make me look like a desperate slag. Then the next day I had to work, despite being super hung over. Like not in the sick way, just my whole body could not stop shaking. Whenever I tried to serve a customer id shake uncontrollably and had to go out the back and I ended up crying. Anyway to sum it all up, I am embarrassed, like I need to quit my job right now because I never want to face any of them again and feel like my coworkers probably think I am crazy and stupid. Although they do know the reason I was acting that way. But now all I want to do is die. I have slept for almost 24 hours, the most I have ever slept in my life. I woke up a few times but could not bear putting up with the thoughts so I went back to sleep. I feel like I have made a big mistake.

I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen.

Prior writing this post, I just had a depressive episode where I cried for almost an hour; to calm me down, I just took a shower and still did skin-care(because I still want to take care of my skin even if I look ugly. #skincareislife).Recently I found myself liking to post seducing photos of me online and makes me feel validated, I guess. Upon writing this post, I started a mock research paper about how posting seducing photos or my sexual behavior will affect my self-esteem. (I am now in a manic episode rn because I have so much things to say) I have already wrote a title, an abstract for it and an introduction. I have 4 pages for it people. I am not taking it seriously but I am curious to see how far this reoccurring maniac inside will go to finish the self-research I am making as I venture myself out as a ""sexual attraction"" online. Well IDK if I am making sense right now. Or maybe I just need someone to talk to idk.

8053,"Hi all, I went through a really bad bout of depression last year (about 6-9 months) I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs. Has anyone had any experiences like this? Am I actually doing myself a disservice by masking my depression? I am scared I might lose another 6-9 months of my life if I do not do something.

8057,"I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine. Losing the definition of myself",Depression

This is stupid and life is stupid and I do not want it. And I cannot really talk about this to people I know, I wrote a message reaching out to my friends and it is sitting there unsent. I do not even want to eat. I have a binge eating issue and I have not been eating or feeding myself all week, which is really weird. I think I am really like giving up lol. I have health anxiety and there are a few things going on and I wish they would just take me out but they are like not deadly or anythingI'm so hungry and nothing.... nothing is something I want to eat, I do not want anything. I feel like someone I really trust is walking all over me and I cannot do anything about itIs this life?? Why?? Fuck, I do not want it. The skin on my fingers are all bitten off at this point, I do not care. I might care in the morning but I do not right now. I am not even in my mid twenties yet and I want to fucking die. Is not eating some sort of silent protest? it is stupid because no one knows but me. God I just do not want this, it is all pain, all of it.

8078,"I cannot name the last time that I live for myself.I live for my mom because she would be pissed if I left herI live for my dad because he is paying for my education, and I would feel bad leaving when I am a semester away from graduating.I live for my roommate because I have to pay the portion for my rent. I live for my pets because no one else will take care of them.I live for my job because I have projects to do and bills needs to be paid.But I just do not live for myself. I do not find any happiness in all of this and never have. I have been hovering over this subreddit for the past four years and nothing has change.I do not know. I always hope things would change, but it just seemingly getting worse. I keep telling myself with every milestone in life, things will change.Well I moved out from home (things got worse), I have good grades (does not matter to me), I have a job in my industry (I do not enjoy it)..Not sure what to do.

8081,"This is a long post and is all over the place. I have to rant as I cannot ever physically say my emotions or feelings and therefore cannot tell my own therapist about this or anyone really. I have been suicidal since I was at least 13. There are notes as far back as 9 saying I might as well die to my doctors. My home life was never good.I have always said Ill die by 40 if I make no progress but it often feels like the earlier the better. My guilty conscience leads me to wait until my family is older. I have been struggling with burnout and usually no one notices in my family and ignores me (probably my fault since I get irritable). For reference, I am autistic (aspergers), have ADHD, anxiety and depression. The latter three since I was 6 years old. My little sister came into my room tonight and made me dinner (leftovers, she knows I do not eat regular meals. I forget or food just is not appealing.. I am very picky and she knows me by now). Pretty sure she heard me crying and saw me cry earlier today, but its making me cry more that she even noticed. Maybe she did not notice but I know she caught on as I was crying as she brought me food. I know I have my own issues, but both of my little siblings are or have been suicidal and hospitalized and I just do not want to add on any pressure to anyone in my family. My older sister has a kid and a divorce at a young age and is unstable in many ways. But I am 25 now and its breaking me feeling so alone and I cannot be perfect. I have had to put on a show since my two little sisters came into my life when I was 15 when my mom got married (which I would not ever trade it was a good thing). I got my act together but instead just have the same issues I did at age 9 at age 25 and have not progressed socially at all. I have not dated. Never been asked out. I lose friends due to being impulsive and saying the wrong things. People say I am nice but somehow all of my relationships are superficial. No one reaches out to me for actual conversation unless they need something. I realized I am starting to suffer severe burn out. Doctors notes say at age 13 I said Ill stay in my room and just not talk. I have done that since and did not even know I saw that. My memory itself it very poor. But here is the catch. How do you deal with burn out when you cannot ever express your true emotions? I always lie on impulse and say I am watching a sad movie (which is what I did today and I referenced a movie I cried to recently called Ride Your Wave). I do not think I can be vulnerable. Therapy and medicine has not helped this because I am too stubborn to open my mouth and say more that the bare minimum. I either lie or get so angry if I have to express the truth, so I never express the truth. The anger is really me just being overwhelmed and I know that others cannot take that well and resent me for it. I was chastised far too often and hit too often as a kid for my fits. To be fair, I hit too. My parents never cared for positive reinforcement or bothered learning how to soothe a mentally ill child. My mother never listened to my doctors when they said she should try complimenting me for once (they legit said this as she was negative in my doctor appointments).How can I be vulnerable when no one ever took me serious enough when I struggled the most and it came off as anger? I got tossed aside so my little sisters could get the help they needed since I got good grades. My own stubbornness makes it so no one wants to help me or ask how I am or how I feel. I just answer I am fine. Its stifling. I never meant to push anyone away but why does no one ask me how I am or press further? It hurts. Sometimes I hate living with these conditions and nights like tonight when my little sister came into my room give me some hope. I am not completely hopeless, but 10 (25) years of working my ass off to feel like I have not gotten anywhere socially and I still cannot cook well and cannot get out of my room. People say to just try/do it. I try it and fail I get overwhelmed and cannot do it again. I am trying hard and they know I am behind but it seems I can only help myself but I just have not been able to. I know at this point I need to do things alone but how do I start? Not to mention there is no new psychiatrist available until October. Online ones exist but cannot prescribe the stimulant I take. I am just stuck. Thanks for reading. I am just not sure Ill be here when I am middle age if I do not progress or even a year. Being behind is hard and people make fun of you if you are a picky eater or are a creature of habit but I cannot help it. Why cannot people be more understanding. Why cannot I understand myself. Its a two way compromise but I am so stubborn I get nowhere. How much longer?",Suicidal
8084,"I will not lie, I put on a good poker face so that when people look at me it seems like my life is sunshine and rainbows. Hell, I have even had people tell me that it seems like I live a fun life. I am young, fit, pretty successful for my age, and not an ugly looking person. Underneath all of this, there is an insecure little boy that suffered from sexual assault as a child, severe bullying, had an eating disorder for 8 years, has mentally abusive parents/has been in toxic relationships, and has panic/anxiety attacks every night. I do not actually have any close friends despite having people that want to be friends with me. When I try to talk to people, it does not feel genuine or they have this expectation of me based on my image that does not reflect who I am as a person. Its exhausting that people think I am a huge ball of fun energy and loves to party, that is not who I am at all. And when they find out how I actually am as a person, it sucks because I literally see them lose interest in me. My family raised me and distilled values of perfectionism and reputation to the point that they stripped me of any bit of originality. When I try to be myself around them, I get told I am being weird or what will people think about you. My own mother calls me ugly and points out the smallest imperfectionsI go on dates and people just want to have sex with me for my body, and when I want to develop an emotional connection I get blown off - often times because the other side did not expect me to be as emotional as I am and it scares them. I feel like I have no one to be vulnerable with and it makes me feel so unbelievably lonely. The thing is, I do not think I have ever felt like I was not lonely. Who am I living for? What am I even working so hard for? How did I even get this far? On the outside everything looks perfect",Suicidal

I had a pounding headache, had to hold my breath so my parents would not hear me crying.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years. I have never hd a girlfriend before and I am 25. The pain from never being able to be with her has contributed to my decision to kill myself; I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.It reads.Dear K,I wish you knew how special you are to me. I wish you knew you how happy I would be if we were together. But I know that would not make you happy. So, I have to let you be happy. That is what I want, because I love you so much.I wish you knew how happy you make me. I wish you knew how full of love my heart is for you. I wish I could hold you in my arms and protect you so that no one could hurt you.When I was young, I learned the word for always in French: *toujours.* It always sounded like a beautiful, graceful, yet heavy word to me. Something about how it sounds. It sounds melancholy, sentimental, but genuine and strong.you will always be in my heart. Toujours. Always. you will always be in my heart.

I do not see any reason to live anymore, nobody In my house listens to me, I guess talking to me about literally fucking ANYTHING is the most difficult thing ever, every. GOD DAMN. THING. yet they can criticize me however they want, I am lazy, I am Ignorant, I am negative, I am crazy.. fucking assholes. some people were not meant to be fucking parents, I will tell you that right now.. sharing anything with them is like talking to a god damn brick wall, my entire life you have just yelled at me and never pushed me to do anything out of my comfort zone. Now because of that I am, just useless... that is all I will ever be,I do not have any friends either, nobody who gives a fuck enough to listen to me anyways, which Is fine. I do not expect anyone to be friends with a mentally ill depressed awkward fucking retard tbh, if I was in their shoes I would probably do the same, so no hard feelings there :) part of me feels bad for doing this now considering what just happened in my mom's family 4 days ago..

I was a loner in school and did not make any friends, I sat by myself everyday at lunch and never had anybody to talk to. My dating life is the same way, since I never really had friends I never got the chance to talk to any girls either. I have never dated a girl or been in a relationship with one. I am 23 and live by myself, and honestly, I have a pretty good life. I am responsible, independent, have money saved up, and I always have a job. I am doing really well for myself, especially for my age. It would just be nice to have somebody to reach out to or some people to hang out with. I would also like to start dating but I have no idea how to meet girls, especially when you have no friends. I have just been going about my life the last few years but I am starting to get really depressed. I do not want to be alone like this 20-30 year's from now, and it seems like now that I am out of school and working it is even harder to meet people. The only time I meet new people is at work. I know I obviously need to make friends, but how? I play my guitar, go fishing, cook, and I also like to read. I know what I need to do i just do not know how to do it...like how does somebody who has zero friends just starting making them? And how can I start getting in the dating scene?

8095,"I do not know where to begin. It feels like there is too much to say, and it all feels complicated. I do not understand myself first off, so it will be hard to explain my feelings to those reading this. I cannot exactly identify my feelings a lot of times. I used to feel true joy, the kind of joy where I felt alive and vibrant. I think I lost this kind of joy in about 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I now am graduating as a senior, and I still feel the same way. Its not like I am necessarily sad. I can feel ok, but i will never feel like the funny girl who could make someone light up from my jokes and personality like back then. I can never feel completely alive. I can never feel completely like myself. I guess along with this, its like I never feel truly happy? I am confused on when I feel happy or not. To be honest, maybe I am never completely happy. Its confusing. I would say actually that I do feel happiness, but its artificial. Its still really cool in those moments when I feel that type of happiness, but it just is not enough? Its like I cannot feel the same with people as I used to. I cannot bond with people the same. Its like I feel robotic almost in conversation? Not much emotion is there lol. I would say that with sadness, perhaps there is always a gloomy disposition lingering in the back of my mind. Maybe for so long, its so hard to identify it. For so long, I have also felt bouts of anxiousness. Even now maybe anxiety is apart of me and its lingering in the depths of my mind I cannot reach out towards because I can barely even identify it. At this point in my life I am just scared Ill be like this for a very long time, I simply do not know if I would want to exist if I knew Id be like this for the rest of my life. I already feel doubt in life, but its because I am so young and just getting into the world and discovering it that I have hope, hope that Ill change and that Ill go on to do great things and experience great things. I am so worried though, I am worried of different things at different periods of my life. It seems like I have new anxieties here and there while simultaneously feeling a sense of uneasiness always inhabiting the back of my mind I guess. I am just not me anymore. Life looks grey I guess. I guess its looked like that for so long that I feel odd even bringing it up, like perhaps its just not true because this has been my normal for so long. Sometimes I feel like I need mental help but then feel stupid because I feel as though maybe there is nothing much wrong with me, but what makes me realize truly that there is probably something wrong with me is the thought of staying like this forever. It makes me not want to exist anymore, and whenever I come to that realization, I immediately know something is not right. I remember whenever I was talking to a nurse about how I felt, but its as though she brushed it off as simply being my personality. It felt wrong, and I hope its wrong. I really hope I will not stay like this forever, and that its not just my personality. It does not feel like that. It should not be like that, you know? I think I should add that I was on Prozac since the end of my freshman year until I think the summer before my senior year btw! Maybe that will help (: But I came here because I really would love to hear some advice overall. What am I experiencing and how do I even get out of this mess? How do I feel alive again? What was it like for you? Just anything at all helps, thank you so much &lt;3 I have not felt like myself in so long",Depression

8102,"(23 M) I come to this sub every now and then for something to relate to, to hear about people who seem to be experiencing life the way I am. It does not matter what life events are occurring, good or bad, people of all ages are impacted by depressive thoughts and ultimately suicidal ideation. I really do not know if I could ever do it. I think about it all the time, even while enjoying the time I spend alive. Recently more than ever it just seems like a real possibility, something to almost look forward too. I cannot think about it without thinking about the people who know me and love me, the problems it may because for them is the main reason I do not do it. When I think about it I also think about the larger picture, the reality of this situation. I understand that even in our darkest moments, tormented by our thoughts and clinging to life by whatever threads we have left, we still do things like this, like reaching out on this sub. As small as this action is, its so powerful. Everyone reaching out and opening up on this thread is so powerful, so desperate to live. Even when all hope is seemingly lost, we compile our thoughts and essentially throw a lifeline in an attempt to save our own lives. Think about how amazing that is, even if we feel so unloved, so hopeless, so lost, ashamed, abandoned, dreadful, or sorry, we still reach out in order to save our own lives. We reach out to beautiful strangers on this app to assist us in this journey of life, to give us just something, anything to survive, or at least make it easier to live a little longer. We are our own friends, we are the people who unconditionally love ourselves, we are programmed to keep fighting, typing a message and sending it on this sub is a huge testament to our strength as humans. You may want to die, but in the most sincere and loving way I can possibly say this, you reach out here, you read these messages because you simply want to live. I hope that no matter what you choose to do in your life you realize the power you have over yourself and your ability to change your own world. You are your own beautiful lifeline, whether you realize that or not. Here I am again",Suicidal
8108,"I had a fairly decent life untill i grow up and I always helped people who had a idea of killing themselves many times back in highschool so this is not a random topic for me, I believe I have changed many people's mind and helped them get better but for the last few years things started to fell off one by one.What exactly do I mean by started to fell off? The girl I met in high school and then become lovers died after 4 years of dating after high school, family is also non existant, had health issues etc.I was pretty okay with many stuff starting the life without a lack of family, having hard time to find my place in the social life and such and always felt strong enough to deal with everything but as the time goes I just got tired of being strong, acting strong, trying to implement myself in to social life and finding people to bond with have a good time with.And recently by losing the last person I felt some connection to the world being gone and myself having some health issues that may or may not be important, having to lose all my friends and now that not being able to find new people and such, I just got really tired, really tired, I carried so much stuff as a child and a grown up but somehow I am now exhausted I never thought I will be this tired in life like ever.I always been a observer but I am tired of being one because I cannot fit myself in to anything nowadays and I am tired of seeing people being happy with something/someone I started to get jealous and question my life and found the details I ignored all this time.That questioning part lead me to asking; Did I really deserved everything? Because should not that be go like, bad things happen then you get some happiness and then it gets a straight line for normal and always climbs up for people who are extremely lucky. (I know there is no rule this is just a random vent I guess?)I concluded on that I do not deserve to be alive and I do not fit in anywhere in life anymore. So therefore I believe that I should just give up at this point because I had enough, I tried enough, I fought enough.Funny part is I still love life, how things go for people around me as I said I spent so much time observing them and I like how good things going for them etc. I am just tired of mine going flat down with everything, literally everything.I kind of do not expect anything from anyone and I still have like a pages of things that I can talk about and the saddest part is I am aware of literally everything; my situation, what should I do, how I sound etc.Anyways this is the chaos going on in my head that I plan to solve by giving up,Thank you.

I feel like my only purpose in life is to make others be happy or do anything that I can to make their life better but it still is not helping much.I just daydream about not being here anymore. There is a quote that I read: Death must be so beautiful. To lie in the soft brown earth, with the grasses waving above one's head, and listen to silence. To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. To forget time, to forgive life, to be at peace. and that is all that I hope for these days.

8115,"Kind of hard to explain in full detail, but I kind of always thought I was a worthless piece of shit but also thought ""hey I am kind of better than other people at this one thing"" which was useful as a job so I figured I would just tough life out so my parents would not be sad and all that stuff. But recently I realized that no, actually, you are not very good at your job, you should have been fired years ago, you cannot get a new job, and you are too useless to do anything else. So my options are essentially to leech off my parents for my whole life or be homeless. Or, possibly, constantly get hired on for low wage menial work and be fired within a few weeks for sucking. I choose option 4 as I do not see any value in life anyway. My desire to not have my parents be sad is no longer strong enough to keep me here. Too bad for them that they took the chance and had a child. I am only partially delaying as the method I have chosen could be dangerous to people so I am trying to figure out how to avoid anyone getting hurt. It should be quick and relatively painless though. I just need a very empty space or something to counteract the toxicity after I perish. Of course I would prefer to have nembutal but getting your hands on it is such a hassle and it is hard to be sure you are actually getting nembutal if you try to get it from seedy sources.

8125,"Hey you all.I am a 38 year old male, married with an 8 year old and a 8 month old. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for around 20 years now. I was passively suicidal about 3-4 years ago, but that feeling has since dropped of dramatically with proper medication, therapy, and leaving a life situation behind that I really struggled with.What I am really struggling with feeling alone and without people that care lately, outside of my own four walls.Growing up, I had a very close family on my mom's side. I have 2 brothers, 4 aunt's/uncle's and many cousins from those. We used to get together every Sunday and all major holidays.My mom passed away back in 2008 and nothing family had been the same since, especially for me. My mom was amazing - she was my biggest cheerleader, my confidant, and talked me off every ledge. After she died, My dad moved about 14 hours away. One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence, to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed, and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away, or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby, because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though, and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned, my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend, and we are super close. About a month ago though, he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life, but I was devastated.On the friends front, I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends, but none that I see or hang out with often - except one - and about 5-6 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time, I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes, I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community, but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90% of the congregation. Tldr - I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me, cut me out of their lives, or died. I am really struggling with relationships, and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die - whether self inflicted or not - who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls, and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for, and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there, and that makes me sad. Feeling incredibly lonely lately",Depression

She has been suffering for so many years and literally she tells me that I am too good for her but I do not want to leave her since I want and I feel able to help her or minimally be close to her but she tells me that her life will not last more than 1 year, since just the day she turns that day that day she will kill herself and it is a margin of time that I have but still I do not know how to encourage her anymore That yesterday she tells me that she began to think about her life and does not remember any happy moment she had and then in the end I managed to calm her down and everything was fine until today where her brother hit her and almost killed her by hanging her and the fight did not tell me why it was but her own mother challenged her brother to kill her and at the end of a single madness step and she meanwhile told me this in her room, kind of what the fuck am I going to do in the sense of, I am 18 years old, I literally think of ways to make her feel better but not I can be even less, (where I live then at You 18 are not necessarily independent anymore) so I do not know what to do to help her since I feel that the more time passes the worse it gets and my efforts are useless, and it does not help me to leave and leave her alone since that may make her decide already kill yourself and I do not want that. I do not know what to do, that is why ask for even some advice (I do not tell my parents because I feel the answer is obvious) My girlfriend has depression and more problems and how her boyfriend does not know what to do even if he is willing to help her",Depression

That cardiac arrest is probably going to hurt like a MF, but my will to live is growing weaker by the day. What is the point of living anymore, I am tired of nightmares every night and the real world. Nicotine overdose might work too. How many cigarettes ad vapes would it take to kill ya? Maybe alcohol would be the better way to go, just get like fifty beers or something maybe a hundred. How bout them other drugs? Not that I have access to them, but that would be nice. I know it is not funny to joke about this kind of stuff, if I did not fear death or the possibility of there being an afterlife, I would be gone in a flash. Well I guess I am slowly killing myself by smoking, so maybe I should stop that. Not that I want to, but I do not want some higher power being like ""hmm, you smoked them cigarettes being fully aware what they do to you? Okay time to send another form of your consciousness to an even worse place MWHAHAHAHA"" Not calling it God, the abrahamic deity called God is so fucking childish, if there was really a creator or high power of some sort, it would not be some dude that said humans were in the image of him, getting angry and jealous, and having three different forms yet saying they are all one. Maybe there is no creator or higher power and the pre-existent bigbang has always existed. I do not know dudes, but I am sick of living, but I do not want to kill myself then become something else within the universe or reality and have dark energy push ""me"" into an even worse place(or I do not know how dark matter dark energy works but something like that) I feel like I am cursed to suffer for all of eternity already. we are already in hell dudes, is it possible to climb the ladder and find the kingdom of heaven from within, I have no idea, but I guess I will try again. Maybe some meditation or something will help me, this world so fucked up yo. How could I possibly know I have not been existent an infinite amount of times? Can you try to think back to what you/it were like before you were born? You cannot, or at least I cannot. Maybe this is really the first time for existence to occur, but there are theories for infinite universes so I do not know. If the universe is possible, then I guess anything is possible. Maybe I am the only one that exists and all of you and everything else is an illusion with my brain and senses acting as filters and playing tricks on me, or maybe I am part of that illusion as well. who is fucking dream is this world? Or is this dream/illusion just self reliant on its own with no one or thing to dream it. An illusion implies that there is an opposite of that like a factuality or actuality or something idk. I am fearful of the unknown, and I do not know anything. I do not have the courage to go through with it. I guess I am not starving in a third world country or enslaved in human trafficking so it could be worse I suppose, I am a whiny kid with a smartphone acting like a little bitch, but I do have my own problems I will not lie.

Obvious red flag, and I knew that then, but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no, Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter. I have to watch as my daughter now has occasional panic attacks, I have to listen as she occasionally weeps in the other room, and I have to feel guilty as a small hateful part of me is glad that her mom is gone and cannot spread anymore poison.

Our dad is a good man, but he is a butt sometimes. he is so supportive with both of us wanting to pursue artistic careers, teaching us how to be more independent, and will never abandon his us. he is firm about keeping us all together (since he is distanced himself from certain distant family). he is talked us both down from trying to kill ourselves more than once.

Our Dad has a bisexual sister and loves her (even though she always gets into trouble), so I know he does not hate us for being LGBTQ+. he is not exactly traditional either (he wants his daughters to be independent), so why cannot he be more supportive?

I have a great best friend who I also met online and that I love very much. I have a good job (it does not pay enough at all and its incredibly boring but the family I work for is wonderful and is the only reason I have stayed with it for 3 years). I should be happy. I have so many wonderful blessings. But I am not.I have only felt worse and worse with each passing month. The depressive episodes are only getting longer and harder to crawl out of. I never want to do anything I like to do anymore. I cannot get excited about things that usually make me happy anymore. I keep having awful nightmares about feeling trapped, cornered, and helpless but everyone around me says Ill be just fine.I know I am loved. I know I am worthy of love.

I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain.

I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here, if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet, get a house and such. So its their mom, my old friend (11F), and her brother (9M). I am not really friends with her anymore, and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed (though he has not been diagnosed) and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting, but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects, but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed, (I have been diagnosed, so my parent are aware) and have self harmed (still kind of am). that is one of the reason we became friends, because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad, depressed, or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general, if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that (some in more detail) to my friend and his sister.

But I am so lost that I feel this need to post something, rather than continue hovering over this sub and other subs related to mental health, depression and anxiety. Currently, I am on 20mg of Lexapro and 600- 900mg of Gabapentin per day. My father was an alcoholic, and my mentally ill mother suffers from bipolar disorder, depression and classic narcissism. I was raised in an extremely religious family in the Bible-belt of USA. My entire life up until 16 was immersed in the Southern Baptist culture. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I did not see my father for 17 years. During my upbringing, my mother and father managed to marry 6 people between the two of them. Somehow during the later years, my fathers 3rd wife managed to get him sober. We reconnected when I was 20 years old and 9 months pregnant. I suffered for years from mental and physical abuse by the hands of my mother and her 3 husbands between ages 4-18. Needless to say, my life centered around their instability. I was the oldest, and therefore inherently responsible for my younger siblings. Being in a violent home, the anxiety I suffered was not acknowledged. I was the girl in school that everyone knew had a rough home. My friends were my escape and still today remain my chosen family. But the fact of the matter is, they do not truly understand my situation. I gravitate towards people who are not nearly as jaded. I leaned on my friends parents for guidance and empathy. I have always been the black sheep of my mothers family. I am creative, incredibly artistic, intelligent, charismatic and I am not sorry about it. However, my family views me as strange and always have. I was always told how much I looked and naturally acted like my dad, someone they hated my entire life. I have absolutely nothing in common with my mother or her side of the family, and frankly, I am extremely resentful. We rarely speak unless its a holiday. I refuse to have my child around their toxicity. My mother is on her 4th husband, and just as manic as ever. My father, who I had so much in common with, died from alcoholism in 2017. After years of sobriety, he lost his film business and drowned his sorrows tenfold. His death was gruesome. He died alone in an old farmhouse, during the August heat in North Carolina. His body rotted for 9 days before anyone found him. I can still smell him today. His death destroyed me. After years of separation from my father due to his substance abuse, I was so happy to have him back in my life. But he suffered from his own mental health issues and lost himself. I miss him every damn day. Fast forward to now. My husband and I have been together since 2008. Our child is 8 years old. I promised myself that I would NOT repeat the cycles of instability and abuse with my own child. I am proud to say I have kept that promise. My husband and I have always put our kid first, including making the decision just to have the one child in an effort to provide the best life. we have done it all. We bought a house in the suburbs of a great small town, we are part of the community, provide a great education, we are not religious, and we make sure that our child has an active lifestyle both in and out of school. We both work full time and I am a part time college student. Our vehicles are paid off and our debts are very minimal. Life is great, right? Here is where my own mental health issues come to light. I suffer from clinical depression and panic disorder. I see a physician regularly and have been on my own medication for a little over a year. My job is incredibly stagnant and in such a toxic environment. Every day I dread this job. I have been there 5 years. Now that I am educated, and have consistent years in a particular industry, I feel confident moving onto a better paying position and hopefully a better workplace. I have been job hunting for four months. The job market is terrible and the competition could not be higher. I have never been so rejected in my life. My car is beginning to fall apart and I cannot afford to fix it, or purchase a new one. My studies can be overwhelming at times and my professors this summer in particular have been hard on us. I have a number of hobbies, including a podcast and I am so lost. My depression is so out of control. I have no family support whatsoever, and I feel like I already lean so much on my husband. I am scared to lean more for our marriage will break. I write this because I am scared my kid is beginning to notice. There are days where I can barely get out of bed, unless it is for work. I wish so badly that I had my dad to call. He had his issues, but he got me. I feel like antidepressants only help me so much. Some days I just sit in my car and think, ""I could just smash this into a concrete wall and it would be over."" I feel like I am a rat in a cage getting nowhere. I have been going through recruiting hell trying to find a new job. I have had many phone interviews, several in person interviews and I am either over qualified, or qualified except one detail they are looking for. I cannot win for losing. Perhaps this is more of a venting post. Am I alone in this? I have always done a great job of putting my own issues on the back burner, pushing through the pain and laughing to keep from crying. But these last 2 months have made me realize that perhaps that was not the best avenue. This is the first time in my life that I cannot escape my depression and my manic episodes. Intrusive thoughts are ever present and beginning to worsen everyday. I cannot brush them off and feel so out of control. I just want to run away. Feeling out of control.",Depression
8213,"I put in my notice last week at the place I was working at. My last day was supposed to be Friday, but they let me go today. I was a temp so there is nothing I can do or say. I was leaving because they had told me things would change and nothing did in the two and a half months I was there.I have another job lined up. I start on Monday. But I had financially planned on working 40 hours this week. I came back from a medical leave last week. I just feel like shit. I am worried things will not work out at the place I am going to. What if there are more lies there! What if my new manager ends up hating me? What if its really stressful there as well? I had applied to a lot of jobs and did quite a few interviews. This new place is not bad, but its not what I really wanted. There was one company I so wanted to work for, but they turned me down last Monday. I am still sad about that for some reason.I hate how I am. Too intelligent to enjoy dumb things, but not smart enough to hang with intellectuals. Too mentally ill to keep a job long term and have a career, but not mentally ill enough to get on SSI or even get into a comprehensive therapy program. Its like I am never right.

Honestly I feel no reason to be here anymore, I do not feel happy I have not felt happy in a long time, I do not know if I have ever really been happy honestly, the few things that bring me happiness do not feel real and eventually will probably fall apart like everything else and I am so anxious of that, that I feel like I am ruining it already, I am nostalgic for a time I have never had, for fake things and fake feelings, I miss when I did not understand and when things did not just so much .

8221,"do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16-year-old, who started high school last year. (In my country we start high school as 15-year-olds.) My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started, I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade (13-year-old me) my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just sky-rocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before, I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure, no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowball-effect. My self-esteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln't participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 6-7 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always: ""We know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. **You just need to try going to school.""**Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks, I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advice/stories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost, this is my situation",Depression

I have done therapy, I am on meds, I am so sick of depending on a pill just to feel ""normal."" it is fucking sickening to think about. Any time I break down to a friend they always say just how much I have going for me because ""I am so smart"" or some other meaningless bullshit. I do not have a bad life, I am almost done with college studying physics, I have both of my parents, they care for me. Of course there is all of the family bullshit that goes on behind the scenes, but everyone has that, so who cares. My gf loves me endlessly, but I feel like an empty she will, why fucking bother. I hate everything about our existence, probably just being dramatic but it frustrates me. Everyone is pitted against each other, we are destroying the planet and no one cares, politics is a nightmare. I do not want to be a part of this world. I am so sick of waking up every day to just go to work and then get baked as fuck. do not tell me to ""get a hobby"" I have done that, I always just lose interest. I have tried gardening, aquariums, woodworking, hiking, biking, running, gaming, every last thing just eventually fades to grey, just like everything else. I do not want anyones help or advice, I just want to voice this somewhere that it does not matter and can just get lost in the 1s and 0s. If I could have anything on the planet right now, I would give anything to just no longer exist.

8226,"Sorry for the mistakes, English is my second languageSo, i have a depressed friend (non-clinical but he is really struggling with it) and I am his comfort friend, so i often have to help him when depression strikes, but lately i do not know how to deal with him anymore.do not get me wrong, I am his friend and i always be there for him, I have tried to cheer him up, i tried to tell him that he is not a bad person, that his problems matter, but it does not seem to affect him how many times i say that he is not a monster, it just seems to get worse, I have tried to tell him that he needs to see a doctor or a psychiatrist, but he does not want to. I have the feeling that he is not trying to get up and fight, he just likes to lay down and feel bad for himself.So i was talking with a friend (clinical depression, beaten 4y ago) and he told me that i should not give him that much attention, because he might get and sometimes it is just worse.So now i do not know what to do, i really want to help him but i do not know how and i do not want to worse things up. that is why I came here, how do you help a depressed friend?

8229,"on december 31st 2020, i made a new year's resolution to kms in 2021 with no exact date.

8232,"I am not sure that this is the right place to do this sorry if it is not. Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25/m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 1/2 years. She told me ""I am going to find someone better"" and she is right. I live in my mom's basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been ""beaten"". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for ""not wanting help"" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk. No one that cares except about my financials which is all my mom ever cared about besides her work. I cannot stay awake during day and i cannot sleep at night. I will never be happy again. I will never enjoy anything.All i can think of is that death seems to be the only way out...I would at least like to talk to someone again and just not be alone...It would be nice to not be ignored once.

I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful, have my own place, live a life I am happy with, fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here.

It feels like that is just not going to happen for me. Sometimes I truly think that I was destined to commit suicide. I am hanging on by a thread at this point and as time goes on the hope I have left gets smaller and smaller. I cannot make any friends due to social anxiety and now spend almost all my days alone. I think I have a decent personality but no one ever gets to see it because of my sa. I feel like everyone just hates me. what is the point of life if you cannot even make meaningful relationships with people? I do not want to die but I do not want to be alive either. So tired of trying to get better and constantly being knocked down. My depression has me in a chokehold rn and I am trying so hard to not end it. I deserve to be happy and live a good life. I am not giving up on myself yet Just when I think I am getting better",Depression
8251,"I am done. I want to end this shit NOW. I cannot take it, I find that the things that I enjoy are berated by others and it hurts. Eh, I guess those things are not really that enjoyable anyway so its whatever. But nobody gives a shit what I think. I get no real support from anyone and its because I am absolutely unvalueable. I am the last person on their minds even though I try to say and do the right things. Nothing works and nothing gets better. Its always the people who I have talked to who end up happy with the last laugh.I will always be seen as potentially dangerous because of the examples of the many men before me. I will always be seen as a loser because I simply cannot compete with the billions of others out there who could easily replace me at any time. I will always feel lonely because no one wants to be around someone like me who mentions anything from this post. do not take what I say the wrong way, I am not blaming anyone else. I am not angry at anyone in particular. Its just about time I stfu and accept that I will always be unwanted. That other people will always have another someone who would they rather be with. That the negatives in life will always outweigh the positives. So no, I do not want to wait any longer than I have to to see what happens in the future. I KNOW my future, so do what you have been doing and leave me alone. I want this to be my final message before I am gone. Know that I am through trying to make new relationships and connections. Know that I am cutting ties with preexisting ones so they will not find out. Know that my parents would not care that much. Know that I have tried. I am done with life's bs, it does not even want me to be alive anyway so why did I bother even reaching out here in the first place? I do not care anymore honestly. It never leads to anything. I am too tired to do anything right now tho, I hope to one day have the courage and energy to have this be over lest I end up being 30 with many more issues.

8263,"I have not genuinely smiled in a long time and nowadays its becoming more of a chore to fake one.

I have a few friends who I hang with from time to time but feel no enjoyment with them at all. My real friends are all over the world and Ill probably never see them again in my life. I cannot talk to anyone about how I am feeling because those friends do not really care and my supposed family does not do much talking. Most days I try to ignore how I am feeling but lately I cannot anymore. I cannot even be bothered to fake being normal anymore. I wake up only to sleep and nothing more.

8264,"I am not sure where to start.. there is many things wrong in my life. However I do not think I have even ""lived"" to begin with. I am 17 since mid june and I feel like I have already wasted my entire life. I have never been in a relationship.(even though I have been asked out a few times before, however I have always rejected them due to several reasons.) I have never been to a party. I have never done drugs or got drunk. I have never had many friends and I have been bullied all throughout my school life. One of the people I have considered my friend in middle school, bullied and used me. She even sexually assaulted and tried to humiliate me with that in public. I have only realized that she was not really my friend later on.My best (and only) friend that I have known since pretty much forever, never texts me back. He always tells me that he forgot to check his messages, even though I see him interact with other people and post stuff daily on the app we chat with. it is been four days since we last texted and I feel annoying and clingy. And I am pretty sure he feels that way about me. I know that everyone does. I am nothing more than a burden to everyone around me. The only time I was any good was when I was groomed into taking off my clothes and participating in sexual roleplay in front of many adult men online when I was 11-13 I guess.. I did it because of my low self-esteem, body issues(I still almost cry when looking into the mirror tbh.)and loneliness, it was the first time i felt someone actually wanted me around. I now know that it was wrong and that I was sexually abused.When I was around 11 years old I have started to get suicidal thoughts and when I was 12 I have almost stabbed myself in the stomach Infront of my older sister and my mother. Both of them called me a freak and said that I was sick in the head. I am still saying that I want to die pretty much daily and they do not really care. Even one time a few weeks ago, I have told my mother before going to bed that I will kill myself that night, because I was so sure that I was going to do it. She again did not care. Just like when I was growing up, she was rather on her phone than paying any attention to me. I do not think my dad knows about all of that. Even if he did, I am pretty sure that he would not care either. My only (childhood) memories of him are just him yelling at me. I mean I was an accidental child after all, makes sense that they rather want me gone.I think I am destined to be a failure and kill myself. I was always the weird, shy kid that barely smiled. My house burned down when I was around 6 years old, which made me even worse. The only thing that actually still gives me somewhat joy is my teddybear that my grandmother gave me for Christmas when I was 3. I know it is kind of pathetic and sad but it was one of the only things that did not burned to a crisp. Something else that gave me joy and an actual reason to live was my cat who passed away. Tomorrow it will be two year without her. I miss her so much. Most times she was the only one who comforted me when I was crying and when I felt alone. The only real one. I am a maladaptive daydreamer, I have been doing it since I can even remember. I often daydream about my favorite characters from mostly anime comforting and being with my all the time, from the moment I wake up to when I fall asleep. It makes me feel even worse and lonely. I use fiction to distract myself from everything. Scrolling through social media and seeing drawings and fanfiction of my favorite characters helps and it actually makes me feel happy sometimes. However those feelings quickly vanish when I snap back to reality.I know that I am just a pathetic and weird loner, who should just die. I have been going to a therapist since april and that does not help me either. I mean, I have gotten diagnosed with social anxiety and I am probably being tested for depression after I have got tested for autism in october. But who knows if I even live that long?I do not think that I will. My life has been miserable. And I am scared of my future. I am pretty much done with school and I have no idea what to do in life. So I should just take the easy way out.I am not sure if anyone's going to actually read this. If you do, I apologize. This post is a mess and I am pretty sure it is hard to read. I just wrote all of my current thoughts down. Also english is not my first language, sorry.Just know that I will not be doing it now or in the next few hours. Writing everything down kind of helped me with not committing suicide. But I cannot promise that I am not doing it this month or the next one. I already give in to the urge to cut myself, so giving in to the urge to ending it all is not far off, right? lol.I think I am just going to sleep soon. it is 2:10 AM where I live and I am pretty tired right now. I hope that you are alright. And I hope you have a nice day/night.(Good)bye. Why even bother with living?",Suicidal
8266,"It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed, if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens, and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad, more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide, bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse, cleaned up their blood after self harming occured, having to see them in a psych ward, being afraid of triggering an episode, being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what, despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking care/supporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way, I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one, much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes, and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity, because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like ""how dare you be negatively affected my someone else's depression, fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up!"" and I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche, a therapist, and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now, but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having, these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me, it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this ""well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now"" and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression, i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said, I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one, no healthcare, I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support, you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden, but it is different when you live with them, you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside, except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this, but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.",Depression
8267,"Hi, I am curious to know how others distract themselves from everything they are going through. My boyfriend has depression, and he does not have any interests or a passion to distract him if he needs to, and since we have some distance I cannot always physically be there for him to be the distraction he needs. When I got rlly sad I usually was triggered by something (not always ofc, sometimes i would just wake up that way). I learned to deal with that by doing something that distracts me, but even when I was depressed I still had a lot of interests and things that I like to do or atleast that would distract me from whatever was triggering me. I just do not know how to help him in any other way rather than going on reddit and see what helps for others to hopefully try it out and let it be something that helps for him too. I just do not know what to tell him or what to do or how to support him since I do not know what I would have done if I had nothing that distracted me, i think i would be doomed idk...

8270,"I am a mom and wife to two beautiful boys and husband. It all started with insomnia due to going back to school, getting covid and trying to homeschool. I got horrible anxiety and stopped sleeping so I tried several sleeping pills to no avail which led to a prescription of Lexapro and Temazepam. The Lexapro sent me into a spiral and after 5 weeks I had to stop it and have had horrible side effects and am now trying to taper off of Temazepam. I do t know which symptoms are from which drug withdrawal but I have reacted so horribly to theses drugs I dream of only having insomnia again. Week after week things never get better. I am anxious, suicidal, and have all kinds of strange symptoms that Dr.s do not understand or want to prescribe more drugs for. I am afraid the meds have caused permanent damage even in the short time I have taken them, and now its like being trapped in hell. I can barely care for myself let alone my kids.

8282,"it is here again. The little voice in my head telling me that life are not worth living no more. I do not know what caused me to snap this time. Or the last, or the time before but by some sorta cosmic joke, I am still here and alive, pretty much everything from joining gang violence on purpose to drinking poision. 6 times I have attempted suicide in the past. I am sure I need to check myself into an institution but tbh it really are not worth it money wise as funny as it sounds. I feel weirdly calm about all this and even have a 3 page note written out to my girlfriend of 5 years lnd friends and family. I guess I am just writing this because I feel literally empty. This most recent attempt is another car crash. On the side of a mountain. I felt the rush, like dopamine hitting the back of my skull. Grateful that there would be no more of me if I did roll off that side, the car hit a rock and slid to the opposite end and thus I am here writing this. I wrote here before but deleted it. I know my psychology is all fucked up here. And words can only do so much so why would writing anonymously change anything I think to myself. I have a will to live I guess, well not by my prior actions obviously. But 90% of me is dead. Throughout all my horrific attempts I still have yet to break a single bone in my body much less get whiplash. Hence the cosmic joke. I honestly wish it was easy to die. I think the reason I have yet to is guilt for my loved ones who will have to suffer monetary and emotional pain for my selfish actions. If anything it would be better if I were just erased. Like I never even existed. That would be nice. I think the reason I write this is to grasp at straws. A bit of hope that my life somehow has meaning in all of this. I really cannot see anything in front of me that is worth living as harsh as that sounds. And that things would be better off without me getting in the way. I do not know really. I am at an impass yet again. How I got through before I do not know and still do not.

8283,"This is my first time posting here or anywhere actually, but I just really wanted to share this with someone. I have lost all my interest in things I used to enjoy the most. I think it happened three or four years ago, but I could not accept the fact that I do not enjoy the thing I used to love the most (it was animated movies), so I kept forcing myself to watch them, but every time I kept having weird thoughts and just would give up watching them thinking that Ill start enjoying later. To be honest, the fact that I lost all my interest made me even more depressed. Now I do not enjoy anything. Listening to music does not bring joy anymore, I skip meals and I do not feel excited for food as I used to before. I used to like cooking, but now frying an egg seems like an impossible task to do. I started getting panic attacks last fall and struggled with thanatophobia for couple years, and now I just have no energy to do anything. I feel anxious all the time.

He ended up having a child with his girlfriend and now they are married, but it was all planned that she would come along and be in our house when we got it. Well, plans changed and my friends wifes parents talked my friends wife out of it and used me as an excuse saying that I am not safe to be around because I went to the mental hospital in the past. They said I am dangerous and Ill end up killing everyone including the kid. They say that, and then say how my firiend is not ready to buy a house, but then forces him on a loan application to buy a house with the in-laws.

Knowing this is how people feel about me (and multiple parties at that) it just brings me down. Ever since I went to the mental hospital, I have been treated like shit by so many people. I have been called a monster, a demon, a threat to society. All because I could not handle my emotions anymore. I wish I could talk to my friends in-law to their face and tell them to tell me I should have killed back then. Honestly I believe it though. I should have just killed myself back then. Its evident the world would have been better off without me, since people are so annoyed by my existence. Jokes on them. I am going to kill myself and make sure people know so they can celebrate my death. I hate this world, and here is another reason.

8286,"I have struggled with anxiety depression my whole life. I have extreme anxiety which I think ultimately makes me depressed. I put off dealing with the issues for years, because of stigma and just not understanding what was going on. In my late teens my mom finally forced me start medicine and see a therapist. I had a lot of bad circumstances, but after I graduated college my life suddenly started looking up. A few months after graduating the most amazing thing happened. I met this cute, funny, guy through mutual friends - and he asked me out on a date. There was an instant attraction. We talked everyday and began dating officially a month later. It was the happiest Id ever been in my life. I had a job, I moved out of my parents house, I had friends, and I had a loving boyfriend. My life was finally coming together how I wanted it. I thought, maybe my depression and anxiety are finally gone. I was always anxious about something bad happening because my life seemed too good to be true.Then - just a few weeks after we celebrated our 6 month anniversary, my boyfriend came over to my house one day and dumped me. I was completely blindsided. He told me he just was not as invested in the relationship as he should be, and was not falling in love with me. He cut me off and never reached out, even on my birthday. My life fell apart. All of my anxiety and depression came back in full swing.I realized that I am not valued or competent at my job, all of my friends have boyfriends who they would much prefer to hang out with.

He thinks that he is holding me back and that he is not good for me, and he admitted that he was considering breaking up with me because of this. But I can clearly see that this is not he wants, and he is just hurting himself by doing so. He also admitted he is trying to push me away because he is hurting me, but will not communicate with me about what hes going through or how he feels.I have tried as many things as I can think of: listening/being here for him, suggested doctor visits for trying meds/counselling, mindfulness, suggested exercises and to meet up with friends and family. there is more, but that is some examples. Despite this, he continues to tell me that he wants to give up on himself and keeps saying that we should not be together, quoting: I wish things were easier, I wish things did not mess up the way it did. But I just want to let you go because you do not deserve any of that and I will keep hurting you if we keep going But I am 100% sure that he does not want to give up on us and that he is just so deep in his depression right now that he cannot see a way out so hes pushing me away to because me less hurt, but its actually hurting me way more to know hes thinking about leaving me.

Following this, he recently found out that a family member has been diagnosed with cancer, which he is understandably struggling with. We were also supposed to be moving in together within the next month but I can tell he is struggling from the pressure of finding a place. In the past two weeks, we took a 1 week break of not talking to each other to try and reflect on things. We both found this extremely difficult and are now suffering because of it. Yesterday, he told me he was considering breaking up with me during the break which was a huge shock to, also he has never said anything like this to me before.

But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home",Depression
8308,"Everyday I see people just doing the same thing but not making any changes. I watch obese people walking into fast food joints. People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here. I think I just have to go to Africa for a few months and be around my people. I realized that living in th US makes me depressed and I do not believe I fit in here",Depression
8309,"Okay, I do not even know how to express my feelings but I will try. I have been lied to in my life by being told if I would work hard and get a good job I would be happy.This cannot be further from the truth. I am deeply upset. Something about me: I am short and an ugly man (nope do not even try to tell me otherwise I once posted on one of those am I ugly subs and I got a max rating of 3 and an average of 1).Okay, so my problem is still that I get made fun of and I am not able to do anything about it and for some reason people think that whenever someone talks about being ugly they are going to talk about dating and women. But I want to talk about more to be honest.Men constantly make fun of me and put their arms on top of my head and whatnot and there is nothing that I could do about it because I am immediately met with ""What are you going to do?"". Hell, society even took my right away for being angry because if I would be called Napoleon, if I will joke back then I would be called arrogant and if I will listen to insults (or jokes as people call it) I would be called a loser. it is a lose-lose-lose situation.I am surprised that men just laugh when I mention my height, they are like ""Oh I just cannot take you seriously"" and god forbid if you get into some sort of management postion people hate taking orders from someone who is short as if I have worked less than them my entire life and as if I do not deserve it. I cannot retaliate or get angry because that would put me on the front page of reddit. So I quietly take insults till I can and after that threshold which is just over, I will not be here anymore.let us talk about dating. Oh and please I am not saying women owe me anything because they do not. On the same note what the fuck is up with the people who go around everywhere saying ""NoBoDy oWeS yOu AnYtHiNg"" well of course they do not but at the same time there is something called being a fucking human. If somebody is hanging off a cliff and you know if you do not help the person will die? What would you do? Well I would go and help that person not because I owe him anything but because that is called being a fucking human. If you are parents love you unconditionally then would you say the same thing as ""Oh gee I do not owe you anything""Now this is one of the cruelest place for being a short man that I have ever seen, I get told everytime some version of ""you are cool and have an awesome personality but I would date you *insert physical characteristics* but it is okay do not worry you will find someone"". Well I have not found anyone and not only that I even asked them after getting rejected ""If you do not mind me asking what do you think I should improve in or is it that there is just something intrinsic about me that is just incompatible between us?"" And you can pretty much guess what I get told.Although I am not going to lie but the way that some women just laugh when I approach them is just cruel and it crushes me from inside like nothing else, I mean all physical pain does not seem like anything to me at that moment. Pro tip: If you want to destroy a man just say 'man up' believe me that guy would be completely and absolutely destroyed.And not only that this is making me bitter and is changing my political views, turns out I am becoming what I hate, I hate people who show no emotion, I hate people who treat other people cruelly for things that they do not control. But now I do not want to care about people or whatever happens across the world because I know when I would need help nobody would be there for me.Not only these things but things like both unattractive men and women are treated differently in courts (I can link the study of you folks want).You know what, I am frustrated at the fact that I cannot let my angry out, I am angry at the fact that I cannot be upset because then I would be insecure.I am tired of pretending I am not upset, I am tired of pretending that I laugh your jokes. I do not. I am tired of seeing people making fun of short guys on internet and pretending I am too cool to get hurt.. I am tired of pretending that I am comfortable in my body because I am not. I did not chose to be this way. I do not want to be treated and respected differently than you attractive people. I am tired of pretending that I do not get crushes after 23 consecutive NosI wish somehow I could show the world and tell them that I am a human too. I feel bad. Everytime you make fun of me I feel stripped of my humanity. And I am especially especially tired of people telling me ""just be yourself"" or ""put some effort in"" and I have been told by those people that I put effort in on putting effort. And those people who say it are always good looking.I am sick, hard work or money did not buy me any happiness. Is it so bad that I want to feel loved and wanted. Shit my own parents made fun of me.I am tired of pretending I am comfortable I am not. I have no zeal none at all to live. Tired of being belittled constantly.",Suicidal

My wife let the insurance lap on our car and I got ticketed after being crashed into.2. This happened right after I came out as trans. 3. Wife could not and would not take me to physical therapy.4. Out of work, because I have to be according to doctor and lawyer. 5. Lawyer tell me I cannot move forward with lawsuit until I get medical bills and tests, which I cannot get to or pay for.6. Wife aborts planned child because I am trans while out at work.7. My job fires me because I cannot come into work because wifes car is totalled and I was a driver8. In moment of distress and grief I try to kill myself.9. I got baker acted in the hospital and not allowed to have phone or connection to outside.10. While I am inside the hospital against my will for a month my wife refused to pay any of my bills, forfeited our apartment, threw away everything that I owned including multi thousand dollar computer and trashed my truck.11. Wife withdrew all money from my bank accounts and police and bank say its legal because she had my pin.So, now I am homeless, Transportationless, moneyless, clotheless and with no credit.It seems like everyone here would tell me that things will get better, I just need to sleep on a couch or at a homeless shelter and put inordinate amounts of effort into building my life back up to less than what I started with, even though I have a shit ton of mental health issues not being treated that make it nearly impossible to keep putting in effort.People will carelessly tell me to go get help at places that I cannot get to reliably, or tell me to do this or that, even though they do not have to do those things themselves.I cannot even reliably get a job because of my credit and lack of Transportation in the USA.I am constantly in a loop of being at my lowest and I need a fucking handout and I cannot even say that without people thinking I am greedy or entitled to money I did not earn, but I am also stuck not being able to earn any money. I do not have internet and I will not even have the phone I am typing this on soon.Does anyone have any recommendations that will actually help me other than just telling me to keep going?I am really getting sick of being at such a low point and truly think of non-existence as being so much better.I have no friends and no family.

8320,"I thought that I was stronger. I am just tired of it. I did what I could my whole life. I feel broken and no matter what I do to fix myslef it just does not work. I came into some bad luck financially when the job I worked at for years let everyone go almost 3 years ago. I was there for years and they fucked me. Victim of credit fraud around the same time. I would include the divorce as a thing, but honestly that was the best part of my life going downhill. I always had depression, but at least I was sad but had the bills paid. Now I am lucky if I can pay the rent on time. I am tired of being exhausted and doubting myslef. I do not feel like anyone really cares about me. THe only one who really does is my daughter. But she does not really know who I am yet. She does not know how pathetic I am. she will see me for who I am one day. And she will resent me. I cannot bare that.

8321,"Hi. So a bit of background.My dad is 54 years old and has been married to my mum for 30 years. When my mum had me (21), she developed postpartum depression which lead to psychotic depression and according to him this has essentially changed her and unfortunately has lead to a somewhat unhappy marriage, although things have recently been stabilised in terms of any arguments. My mum has also suffered abuse as a child and multiple different traumas which has lead to her being very underdeveloped cognitively and intellectually which on top of the depression results in her being unable to properly look after herself. This is why my dad has never divorced, hes never said it outright but I reckon the only reason he stays is because of the sense of obligation.His relationship with me as a child used to be good, but it was always tainted with his anger. He would shout at me for spilling juice or for asking for magazines/toys, or just for nothing if work had been bad. Essentially as I grew up, I became more frustrated with his anger and started shouting back as a teenager does. He took this to mean his anger should not be restricted then. One time when I was 14, I went to the wrong street for him to pick me up (one street over) and as soon as I got in the car, he started driving as bit, hit the brakes then screamed in my face I HATE YOU, I FUCKING HATE YOU. He would always apologise after but it felt like walking on eggshells always. I have not had anything like that recently with him, but I do not know if that is because hes better or there is more distance between us in our relationship. Overall, I very much get the impression that he feels trapped by my mother and I, that he wishes life could have been different.He has his mum and dad but his anger has caused their relationships to be strained. He has maybe three friends? But he only sees them at work.I have suspect this has caused him to be depressed, bear in mind hes never claimed to be outright depressed. For a while now hes talked about death and he hopes he dies soon. My mother was on holiday with him last year and told me that she found him weeping in the shower and after that he tried to leave the apartment naked (mental breakdown?) but he was fine the next day. I did not say anything because I was scared, terrified of what he would say if confronted about it. The only person I would ask about stuff like this is my dad, but that is not an option. My mother is in no state of mind to handle this so it falls on me.Tonight he said to me that we had to talk about what I should do when he dies, get everything in order. I said to him no let us not, because you are not going to die for a good while, to which he responded with you will be lucky if I am here next week. He then reminded me before going to bed about this talk were to have. I am terrified. I think hes going to do it. I love him so much please help me here. I do not know how to help him. I do not even know if I am overreacting or what. What should I do. I think my Dad might kill himself",Suicidal
8324,"I feel like I have tried everything.I am 22, I have a wonderful 8 month old daughter, I completed my Bachelors degree in 2 years, I work at my dream job in a level one trauma center as a Trauma RN, I own my own home and paid off vehicle. I am fairly healthy, I gained some weight during my pregnancy but before and even the past 2 months I eat pretty well, count macros, workout 4-6 days a week. I have tried so many medications, therapies, psychiatrists, psychologists. They all say I am improving but in reality I just shut down every time I go. I am tired of feeling the same way day in and day out and hearing the same crap. I feel like I do not get anything helpful that actually changes my life. I do not have many close friends or people that I enjoy being around, I feel exhausted after my days of working or having lunch with a friend that may only even last an hour. I have tried the ""fake it 'till you make it"" bull crap, positive mindset, yoga, everything. I feel like my mind is a black cloud that chokes out every happy moment or thought.I kept telling myself when I was in middle and high school that this would be it, when I finally achieved what I wanted to and had my dream life maybe I could get stable ground and not feel like I am running away from my own thoughts 24/7. I am sick of being depressed. It is robbing me of my life.

8341,"How do you even begin to explain your depression? I am hurting and I feel super alone. I have people around me and I am sure they will listen, but to what extent? I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long. Honestly I could write a novel because there are so many sub-categories to what is adding to my mental health crisis, but where do you even start when you have never been heard?I am so tired.

8342,"I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR; my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much, and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing, like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment, the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with, I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, I promise, I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also, also, I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them, majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication, but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways, I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it (long story)",Depression
8344,"I have suffered from social anxiety and swings of depression for years (28 y/o). Most of my friends I have kept joined the military long term so I only communicate every once in a while through text or call. I met a girl almost a year ago who had so many common interests it was crazy. Even the mental health problems. We used to work together, but I recently got a new job. We saw eachother almost every day, and talked EVERY single day, without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year, and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years, and she has been much help with my journey. But at times, I would start arguments with her over minuscule things, that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years, and stupid me started drinking (I am not an alcoholic, I just needed something to clear my head) She asked for space, but I kept texting her, I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me, and that I was going to go to her house. (I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated, and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like, I just looked for any outlet of attention). At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done, no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person, but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable, and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things, but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on, but I feel terrible. I now have no one, I am alone, but worse, I have hurt her to the point of her being scared of me. My entire family line suffers from depression or bipolar, and I see no light at the end.

Then i let myself go and got really obese and just did not think about relationships for a while. I have tried improving myself, I make a six figure income, i travel the world, i dropped the weight so I am no longer obese. Paid for microneedling to remove acne scars.. and nothing despite trying every dating app. I even went on sites like SA to see if i could pay for companionship and still nothing. I share my picture and get ghosted. Its quite the hit to ones psyche. And I have been putting myself out there for over a year at this point. I have definitely had thoughts of just giving up and resigning myself to being alone for the rest of my life but that has cascaded into some fairly dark ""what is the point of it all"" notions in my head that id rather not contemplate again. So i get myself up and try again each day knowing its probably going to go on like the last :/ I am sure this is fairly common to some extent, but I have been getting reallg low more frequently because i think I am goibg to die alone with no kids",Depression
8365,"All I want is to fall in love and have a happy life with someone. I do not want items or wealth really. A stable living, sure, but no extravagance needed. Literally all I want is for someone to love me how I want to be loved. I have been in four major relationships and they have all been SO amazing. No drug on the earth has felt so good. But I have ruined every one of them. Its like I cannot even control myself. The narcissism runs so deep I do not know what I have even done or said until I sleep and when I wake up I feel like an absolute pos. And eventually the apologies run thin and finally they leave. I do not want to be this way. But I always have been. I hate myself so much. I am 30 now and felt like this last woman was the one. she is now gone too. I am in such a deep hole. I just cry randomly throughout the day. I cannot be alone but no one wants to be with me after a year of dating usually. I think I am hopeless and really want to just blow my head off. I really want to die but I am too addicted to the highs to let go",Depression
8373,"Like the title implies. it is been quite a few weeks since I last self-harmed, to the point where most scars have faded, as my family has not said anything when I wear tank tops or dresses. That or they just do not give a shit. did not do it to 'feel something' or 'let my emotions out - I am not good at reading my own emotions, but I am pretty sure it was just to punisg myself when I slacked on schoolwork. Well I am out of Sixth Form now, waiting to see if I have gotten into uni, generally doing OK with the help of meds, then suddenly one tiny bad thing and BOOM. I want to take some scissors to myself. I acted like a shitty friend, said I was ill when I just was not up for voice-chatting, and now I just want to punish myself again. And to be honest? I do not see why I should not. I did something wrong, they are too nice to call me out on it, so I should carry out punishment myself. With the area I have chosen, there is little to no chance of any risk, and I do not really mind scars, so why the hell not? I deserve it!

8375,"it is what the title says, I guess. I have read the community rules and I hope/think this fits here. If not, I am sorry and please just delete it. Anyway, here is my deal: I have always had low self-esteem and a pessimistic worldview. In the last few years, I;ve been working on getting better; I managed to land my dream job, have some good friends, a supportive family etc.Then the pandemic hit and I had to move in with my parents who live in a small town, far from my friends and I am now about to lose that dream job I had, since it was a. freelance writing gig with an expiration date. My contract is only valid till October, then I am SOL and have NO IDEA what I am going to next. Anyway, this is just to give a little context about where my life's at rn, but the thing is that I have been able to deal with everything so far, but for the last idk how many days, I have not. I have been having trouble sleeping and I have to absolutely force myself to do anything (sometimes I am able to, sometimes I am not), most of the time I lay in bed and watch stuff until around 2am, then I go to sleep and start all over again. I have also been crying a lot out of nowhere and have this sense of dread and hopelessness all the time. I do not want to do anything, I do not feel like talking to anyone and I just wish I could just not exist anymore. IDK I guess I am just wondering if that is just regular sadness about my life being in a bad place right now or if I might benefit from getting professional help and asking for support. Thanks! I need help understanding if what I have been struggling with is actually depression",Depression

Both of my parents died when I was young and I was raised in an orphanage. I am 29 and currently working.For as long as I remember, I have faced extreme racism. It really began after 9/11 when people assumed me to be middle eastern and I was attacked by a mob near my home. Since then, it has not stopped. No matter where I go, even today, I am racially abused, and everyone assumes I am a rapist or criminal because of my race.For over 20 years, I have been trying to pick myself up and brush aside everything, and for 20 years it has continued and gotten worse.It is not just in my everyday life either, whenever I go online, there is no good news about India, and the racial insults are even worse.No matter what I say or do, I am only Indian and nothing else, and my life is shit because of it.Why am I treated this way for something I cannot control?

8381,"Plain and simple. Recently single after an 11 year relationship. Its my own fault. I loved her more than life itself. My parents live across the country, so her family was my family. And now without her, I have no one. We bought a house together last year and it was like we were living our literal dream together. Just the two of us and our dog. Our little family. Its everything I had ever imagined having and wanting. I am crushed. I am broken. I have never wanted anything less than losing her. She was home. She was my everything. We were visiting my parents when it all happened. Her dad came and picked her up from Florida and they flew home together today. Her family was packing up all of her stuff from our house yesterday. When I get home tomorrow, I will have nothing. Sure, the house will be there. A little bit of the furniture. But nothing meaningful. she will be gone. The dog will be gone. If they forgot to pack her cousins handgun that is in the closet, I might just use that and get it over with. If not, I might buy some sleeping pills and do it more peacefully. I do not really know yet. I do not have anything to live for.",Suicidal
8385,"I am so proud of myself. I finally got my butt back into therapy after struggling for the past three years and was diagnosed with severe depression (no surprise I just think I did not want to hear it). I am finally being consistent with getting help since this therapist is a great match for me. they are smart, quick witted, and good at calling me out on my bs and getting me to reflect on my own thought patterns. While I still do not feel better I feel more hopeful and I am grateful. I have started to enjoy life again. I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness: - I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. - I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety, it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. - I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. - I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100% happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have. To everyone who is still struggling I hope you are able to get the support you need. Depression is nasty but I hope you find someone or something to help you bear the weight. I am proud of you for living. I wanted to share my small wins &amp; progress :)",Depression
8389,"All this time I knew something was wrong but I never really knew what. I thought I hated my body, I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me, I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling, and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know",Depression
8390,"I know it is so hard, to feel totally alone in the world, isolated at a disconnect. Remember that we all struggle alone, we all need people, we need people to make us feel alive, make us feel known, they become our safe place, where we run away too, who is arms we curl up and hide in. it is ok not to be ok alone. it is ok to desperately want and long for people, comfort, mutuality, touch, connection, emotion.Your not weak for that, you have not failed. it is not a societal expectations for, a neccecity, it is your want, you desire that, and you are deserved of it.I know practically it is like what do you do? But first and foremost remember in mind that your ok for wanting that, needing that. it is not an impossible ask, it is just very difficult for you right now.Friendship is a part of life, a thing that happens as you live, more people, more opportunities will come along line as you live. You have not missed your moment, this was not your one shot from which ever after you will be alone. You have the whole off your life to work on this.Just keep trying, keep working at it, learning and growing, trying to work the problems your facing, understanding what it takes for you to have the friendships that you want. Think of it as less a task, with a set end, an objective. it is exploration. People are, each and every one, ends in them selves.it is hard where your at right now, I know because I am facing something similar, I have been alone some many years now, lest some occasional offchance.

8399,"Over the last year I attempted to switch jobs and was let go from my new position due to my ex gf making a false statement about me online. I moved away with my girlfriend, cannot find work and cannot afford to pay my debt. I have sold everything I own to make ends meet. I have handed out 1000s of resumes, and I have a lot of experience and certificates in trades and engineering but I think what my ex said about me previously is preventing me from screening. We recently relocated and my girlfriend found employment. My car mirror was vandalized and my insurer will not be covering the repair it seems, so I cannot drive to work. I have dealt with depression, anxiety and suicide before, but never this bad. I had to pay a bailiff to not repossess a car I cannot even drive.

I am clean and sober, I do not smoke, I treat every person I meet with respect and I am always there to help. I hate seeing my girlfriend cry and I am not sure what else I can do at this point.

I do not take the advice she gives me and going there I just wait for it to be over. It makes me feel sad when she makes me think about my emotions. I am too tired to go (not because lack of sleeping, I have just had this weird issue of being too tired emotionally and not really able to do shit because of that, do not know why) and it is starting to feel useless to go because I keep most of the things inside of me and overthink. It would be so much easier to just stay at home and act happy. No one understands anyways. I cannot find a way to tell her I do not want to go anymore and at this point I feel like help is useless. It will not help anyways and I am not going to have any dreams for the future because I do not want to stay. I just want to have my last night of sleep, last meal and last gaming session. And then end it all. That would be a thousand times easier and end the pain. I do not really mind dying because I have no dreams and I am just living my boring NPC life.

It makes me feel crazy.I live in a third world country where its illegal to try to commit suicide and where no one really gives a shit about mental health.The fact that I manage to do well in school and am ambitious while simultaneously constantly contemplating suicide would not make sense to those around me - it does not even make sense to myself.I tried to kill myself last year during quarantine, did not work, obviously.I spent most of my time in therapy sorting through the damage left from my deadbeat father.Academic pressure is really high right now because I sit for my final exams in two semesters (sounds like a while but its really not considering the amount of work Ill be having and revision Ill be doing).I cannot even begin to imagine how Ill cope with the stress once I go back to school in September (I go to boarding school btw).I cannot do this anymore.

8434,"Hopefully my behaviour can help find out why. I tend to be very apathetic, apart from when I am stuck into researching my favourite subject which is nutrition and have become very impatient with my former favourite hobby I engaged in to relieve boredom, which are video games. I have some suicidal ideation, because nutrition can only provide so much information and find it extremely difficult to start new hobbies like learning an instrument. I have so far failed to mention my autism, which I inherited from my purely parental lineage and had diagnosed from a professional and autism has been linked with depression, although I do doubt my diagnosis to a small degree. My heart rate is in the 90s which is a possible indicator that something is wrong with me since higher heart rates are linked with depression, shorter life spans and a greater chance of CVD, although I am exercising and eating some legumes to lower it as much as possible. I am taking lamogtrigine which is supposed to stabilize my mood, as my consultant thinks that I may have Bipolar and I am growing some broccoli sprouts to treat my autism as it is the only shown treatment of autism there is, if I even have it in the first place.(I am whole food starch based, but I understand if you do not want to leave animal products behind, as my oldest sister still likes them.)My main issue with making friends is anticipatory anxiety, possibly induced by church up until we stopped attending, much to the dismay of the pastors at 14 and maybe attending school at 14 after a history of only homeschooling. I am completely fine in the presence of others, like at school and can tolerate them fairly well outside of regular social meetings, but the main reward is walking out of the regular meetings for sure, knowing I have some time before I encounter them again. Quickly going back to nutrition, I think I might be deficient in both calcium and magnesium, which seem to have a role in mood, alongside the obvious ones being bones and muscles and I am also taking ashwaganda. My grandfather on my fathers side, the autistic and very quiet one who only every talked to my mother once in his entire life, thankfully it being the pleasant topic of his civil engineering career. (He shook hands with the queen for an important construction project once, despite being very middle class.) I also have problems falling asleep at regular times, but no issue getting it consistently. I must further mention that I have had severe seperation anxiety based on my mother, to the point where I very rarely could be left with strangers and could not even be held by my own father, who has suffered from general anxiety for as long as he can remember.I grew up in a Christian community and also a completely secular sailing club, which gave me the feeling of being Jekyll and Hyde before having known about the book. But both feelings where equally enjoyable. Although I was in a Christian environment much more. This was balanced out by three and a half years of schooling I suppose, although one of my friends at church who I do not see anymore thought religion was stupid and my mother and I think he could have been autistic. I keep in sparse contact with one friend from my Christian-hood and none of the good friends I made in public school.And yet, after all of my research into nutrition and other lifestyle changes, such as aerobic fitness, what could be the because of my low mood? Any supplements you guys would recommend, as I am also taking boron which is a unessential mineral that boosts testosterone a fair amount among other things.Thanks for reading this long post.

8436,"I am not leaving anything behind but she will understand. For the longest time, she was enough reason for me to stay alive but something went wrong along the way.

She really tried to help me and understand me though. She was even willing to sacrifice her health to help me. A few days ago, I told her I was self harming again. She begged me to not off myself. It was like she knew that it was coming. I never even told her about how I was researching methods. She was screaming at me to not leave her here alone. I cannot stop thinking of how much this is going to fuck her up. She already struggles with bpd. This is going to really ruin things. She finally started taking therapy seriously too. I know she is strong enough to live through this and she has better emotional connections with people so she will be fine in a few weeks. I would not be able to live without her. But she would be able to live without me. She is so much stronger. I wish she never knew me because then she would not be sad over my death and I probably could have done this a long time ago.

I see my dad maybe 2-3 times a month and its only ever for a few hours. He beat me once when I was young and I had a horrible stepmom who neglected me and verbally abused me for years. He never got in trouble as my mom did not press charges but that and my stepmom basically ruined our relationship. I have a girlfriend with severe depression and anxiety issues. I will not go into specifics for her sake but Ill just say her alcoholic father caused a lot of her trauma. This girl means the world to me and I want her for as long as I am alive but i just do not know anymore. She smokes weed and vapes and it kills me to watch it. I always try to convince her to stop but she says you know what you signed up for. When I try to talk about it she makes me out as the bad guy every time. It genuinely crushes me like nothing else. All but 1 of her friends are what Id consider addicted to weed and nicotine and they are horrible influences. I try to tell her she needs/deserves better friends and then she calls me controlling. I truly am not controlling I just want the best for her. Her mom and I have discussed it and she agrees with me. Idk it just feels like I am trapped but do not want to escape.

8443,"Ever since i was little my parents have always fought and blamed everything on me, just turned 18 yesterday and still nothing has changed. My parents put there expectation on me initially becoming a tennis player, so they trained me for 11 years of my life, i had no childhood as i would immediately after 3.30pm after eating would play tennis 3 hours for years on end, high school was difficult as i was unable to multitask between tasks. (i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them.Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden of having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to falsely hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal
8446,"Hello everybody, I really do not know what I am supposed to say because I am BALLS DEEP in the abyss of isolation and misery right now and my thought patterns are all the way fucked up, but Ill try my best and hope to interact with fellow sufferers. I am 21 years old, live in New Jersey born and raised, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, schizoafective disorder, and PTSD, prescribed 900mg Oxcarbazepine(Trileptal), 1,200 mg Neurontin(Gabapentin), and 80mg Ziprasidone(Geodon) daily and feel like my symptoms have only worsened since I started taking medications and stopped smoking weed(50 days clean). I am never happy, I am always miserable, I am always fucking bored, I lost all my social skills, i have 5 friends, my family does not even like being around me, my coworkers all know I am fucking insane and keep a distance from me, I work at a gas station because I feel too incompetent to do anything else lol cannot get lower than that, I had a physique like a young Hollywood teen actor until I allowed my depression to destroy it, now I am skinny fat, I always feel like a useless piece of shit degenerate loser, I have only been laid by three girls and all three of them just wanted to fuck me for my body, I have suicidal ideation running through my brain all day long, hell I even almost died last year from a suicidal overdose on a bottle of lamictal but thankfully I survived it and got locked in a nuthouse for my 5th time in a three year span, when I am not at work I lay in bed on my phone all day long, joy ride, take walks, stress eat, or go to the gym, and when I am there I deal with crippling social and performance anxiety and can barely lift for an hour. I am emotionless, cold, have repulsive thoughts, existential dread, have destroyed any opportunity I have ever had placed in front of me, feel like an outcast, etc etc etc. I tell my psychiatrist that I do not want to take my meds anymore, he gets nasty with me and tells me that he will not wean me off of them and if I want to stop taking my meds I am on my own. I got discharged from my Intensive Outpatient Therapy Program for smoking weed and refusing Residential treatment. I am so fucking stuck and have no idea what the fuck I am still doing existing, I want to fucking die, but I do not want to kill myself because I am scared of the pain of dying and what it would do to my parents. I smoke a juul pod a day for the sole purpose of getting cancer and all I want to do right now is smoke weed and mask my pain. My life has felt like a curse and a nightmare from the start and I feel like I am incapable of turning it around, being loved or giving love. I am not asking for anybody to come up with a solution to my problems, I just want somebody, anybody who feels the pain I do or worse to interact with me because I am fucking lonely and scared.

8447,"So i just moved out from my moms house and my home town after 22 yrs. And as much as i like it, i am also anxious and stressed. Its probably because i have a puppy/9 months which i brought with me, it is mine afterall. But since its my first dog ever and my first time ever moving out i am very overwhelmed. I had depression long before i moved out or got a dog aswell. When i was home in my hometown i felt less stressed because of much less responsibility.. now i have work, i have my dog, rent to pay, bills, food expenses and gas for my car.. I have exams in 3 months which i need for my apprenticeship/where i work.. I am so stressed and overwhelmed and idk what to do. I feel like I am going to get very mentally ill if i keep feeling like this for a long time.

8450,"I feel like my entire life has been suffering and traumas. My dad was a drug addict, beat my mom and treated me bad before he committed suicide when I was young. School was shit and I dropped out of depression without a sense of direction in life. After that its been jobs I dislike with low pay and being unemployed for long durations. I live with constant anxiety, the meds is numbing some of it so I guess that is something. I still have so much anxiety that I get stuck at home in the morning, I do not like my current job but they have been understanding. But my contract there is only until end of August and I doubt they will want to keep someone like me around any longer than necessary. I have also started to suffer from smell hallucinations recently, lifes way of showing me that things can get worse I suppose.

I enjoy studying CS and computer programming, but I just have no desire to do it now.I worry a lot about finding a job when I graduate next year. I hate working for people, but I have no choice. I feel like such a wage slave, doing these meaningless jobs that realistically do not matter to anybody or make anyone's life better except for some ultra wealthy corporate owners who really could not give a flying f\*ck about you or anyone working along side you. Then there is the fact that the world has gone completely f\*cking mad and quite literally insane since 2020 rolled around. If you DARE to disagree with anyone nowadays, you are considered a threat to humanity and must be purged from the Earth. People are so far divided over everything, it makes me f\*cking sick. People are cutting off friendships, family members are refusing to talk to one another because of various political issues.Oh, and one other thing, I am living with my parents now and I hate my father. he is an incredibly depressing, disgusting, pathetic individual. I thought about whether I would feel sad if he suddenly died tomorrow, and honestly I could not find an answer. Someone I met awhile ago gave me some sage advice about people like him: ""miserable people enjoy making other people miserable"". I cannot stress enough how true this is! I cannot wait to get the f\*ck away from this guy when I leave to go back to school in the fall. I need help. I am not sure what to do other than come here and complain.

I have thought about taking a whole bottle of pills, but the chances of failure are too high. I have thought about jumping off a building, but that feels too public. I have thought about just slicing my wrists really deep, but that seems too middle school. Lately I have started slamming my head against the wall when I find the time. I am hoping that maybe I will get a concussion and never wake up. Or maybe I will start a brain bleed that will take me out eventually. Ideally, I would like it to crack my head like an egg. I am too scared of guns, and I definitely cannot buy one so that is out of the picture. I worry that maybe my light fixtures are not strong enough to hold me if I hang myself. I have thought about just starving myself to death, I have an eating disorder that leaves me at 93lbs, so maybe it would not be hard. But I know starving to death would be so shitty. If I die, I do not think my boyfriend would join me, but I know it would fuck him up. I try my best not to write anything about how close I actually am to killing myself because I worry that if I follow through that he will go through my stuff later and see all these plans. If he sees all these plans, I worry it would make him hurt more because it was under his nose this whole time but he could not do anything. I think it is coming soon. Nothing is exciting anymore.

I also got to say that I have always been a melancholic type of person. I experienced lots of new emotions when I moved here, with the cultural shock and having to properly learn English, and find a new way to make friends has been hard.

I never felt anxious before, until covid and all that shit started to happen. there is some days when I feel so sad, and I just want to lay in bed and cry.

I believe I do not have a reason to be sad, I have honestly a great relationship with my husband, hes super supportive and hes always there for me.

Sometimes I feel this world is nothing but a nightmare when I think about the past and how people used to act. People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years. I used to be a sensitive person who felt a range of emotions and I used to be able to get excited about things. Now I feel like a broken person, I do not feel much anymore except extreme despair and sadness which eventually feels like nothing after a while. It is great how everyone else gets to continue to live their lives and experience all these things that people take for granted, while my life declines and gets worse everyday. Every day just gets worse for me. cannot relate to others anymore",Depression
8504,"Recently my boyfriends ex threatened suicide and the wave of emotions that washed over me was almost too much. I grew up in a very abusive household where my sister and I were both physically beat and emotionally abused. I had the added bonus of being sexually abused. From a very young age we learned to fear our father and his moods. I can recall my mom attempting suicide multiple times when I was growing up. I can vividly remember seeing her in the shower with her clothes still on and my dad trying to get her to throw up.Ill never forget the nights my sister had to spend in the hospital after her attempt, she came very close to succeeding. My attempt was much more low key but it was there. Thank god my best friend told a school counselor, he literally saved my life. Of course therapy was never an option, we had to maintain the appearance of a happy family, no one could know what went on behind closed doors. I am not sure where I am going with this. All these images and memories keep popping up in my head. I thought I had dealt with the trauma that was my younger years already. I guess my therapist and I still have work to do. All the women in my family have attempted suicide",Depression
8505,"So this is a post that I have been meaning to make for a while. I suppose you could call this an adjustment disorder. I realize now that the career I so loved is not going to work out for me.And it is too late to reasonably switch.I have been looking at the balcony recently more and more. There are people working outside so it would not be a good time to make the move now. What do I tell my family? My friends? Do I just say goodbye? Tell them how much I appreciated their love and kindness? There are days where I have felt good recently, but it is fleeting. I have literally failed badly in the prior weeks due to this depression in my residency, effectively closing the door on a subspecialty I think I would have enjoyed. Now I am stuck - likely not going to get a job in an area or in a hospital that I will remotely enjoy. After a decade and a half of my life, 12-14 hour days and intense, emotional stress. This is it.I supposed I should be grateful. I do have a loving family. A loving girlfriend. My best friend lives in Vancouver, he checks in from time to time. My sister recently visited and it was very nice seeing her.I did a trial of therapy. She gave me breathing exercises and some CBT to help cope with these negative thoughts. However, at the end of the day, none of that is going to change the situation I am in. I could have had so much more. I will always think that in the back of my mind at work. I know this about myself. it is going to drive me crazy. I gave up so much to be where I am at today. I supposed this is a spoiled, comparative mindset that is truly unhealthy. I should be glad to be making a top income in the US. I have the ability to subspecialize and impact people's lives in a nice way. But I fucked up. Royally.This is not a goodbye. I know I will likely not end it today. But I will give it a few months, I do not see this lasting long for me. Probably not a good idea to post this to my main account so I will move this to my throwaway from years ago.Thanks for reading. I have not felt anything positive in a long time. Feels like there is a weight attached to my eyelids and it is hard to truly FEEL. I love my girlfriend, I love my family, my dog, my friends. I truly do. But I cannot feel it. I cannot feel anything in the past few weeks to months. it is hard to keep going like this. physician suicide",Suicidal
8506,"I have no right to be depressed. Over the past decade, I have fixed my life, mostly. I went to college, got my degree, got a great job with fantastic co-workers... But that does not take away from the fact that I did in my 40s what I *should* have done in my 20s.I am looking back at a wasted life and seeing things that I will never achieve now. Getting married? Having kids? Pft... I did not do it in the past because I was not going to subject anybody to the immature shitshow that was my life, and I am not doing it now because I do not want to subject anybody to the immature depression that is my life. My meds are helping me to not break down crying on a regular basis, but they do not take away the hard truth that my life is almost over *and it was wasted*.Starting my life so late is also putting me in the wrong peer group. The friends that I had from high school until my mid-40s are no longer a part of my life. Right now, my very best friend is nearly half my age. All of my co-workers are also young Millennials. Some are even Gen Z. My belief structures are more Millennial than Gen X, as are my interests. I am currently watching Avatar and She-ra, for fucks' sake. :(Funny thing? I am not suicidal. I have a crippling fear of death. Non-existence just scares the hell out of me. I just want more time... Or to take back what I wasted. My co-workers accept me and include me in their social lives, but I cannot help but think that I am just some creepy old guy hanging out with kids... Kids in their mid-to-late 20s, but still. We get along, our interests are the same... But I do not belong. Then again, I also do not belong with most of Gen X either. I am just a fucking mess right now and need to vent. Sorry for wasting your time :( I am turning 50 in a few days and I am depressed as f*** about how I have wasted my life",Depression
8511,"Is been a while since i posted and left the things halfways. I explained how I was forced to quit from a well paying work and have been unable to recover economically since. I have severe trust issues now and have become very bitter and cynical. Last time I also told you about how i started wandering alone afterwork looking for troubles until i was finally assaulted and went so far as to goad my aggressor to pull the trigger on me. So I started therapy. I was still being somewhat supported by both my exs, one helped me find a place to stay and try to recover enough to find a job again and the other one lend me her shoulder and listened to me whenever she could, i was grateful for that. Then the therapist made me realize a few things. First of all that i was right to be depressed, my story was harsh, and she was amazed i went for so many years without looking for help. I told her that i already do things to stave off depressions since i sculpt, write and do digital art as a hobby, but lately that was not enough, i felt and i still feel like i do not get joy from it anymore. She suggested we started with telling her about myself, about my relation with my family, with my friends, etc. So it turned out that i was not only depressed but had repressed over 20 years of anger, since i always acted as a mediator or a problem solver, i barely ever let out my anger be shown. I have adandomnent issues because of a very traumatic episode that ocurred when i was five and is something that keeps on dragging with both my ex's leaving me at some point, although both cases were amiable enough i got hurt and moved on or tried to move on. This feels like senseless ramble, sorry. So i quited my job on the call center. I move cities again and had to stop seeing my therapist because of money being short. I started working at a winestore and i kept bashing my head against the boss's. He was an idiot. I also understood that i have a very difficult time working with people face to face. I am not only assertive but also quick to lash out against costumers and the boss if i feel atacked somehow. I left the place after a year, they did not fire me because even though all the fights, i was a good worker, and one of the few that did not quit after 2 weeks of work because of it being too hard. I left on my own volition after a discussion about the contract, and since i was a petty jerk y waited enough to time my quitting with the holydays, so bossman would have to cover my absence himself. Just after quitting, i got on a fight with a close friend, and my landlord decided to evict me just because. Actually i know the reason but since the place was offered by a ""friend"", i took it at something they would go ""backsies"" later on. Trust issues, man. Since i was getting evicted i stopped looking for a job, took my stuff and returned to my folks places, which does not make me happy. I was wanting to burn my savings on the therapy again but i felt bad about using money while not having a job, then covid came and jobs became more difficult to get. One of my ex's finally decided to push me into drawing lewds for commission. It was an old idea i never truly tried because I am not comfortable about it, is not something i like. But my regular art never got attention. With her help i created a super corny/girly/nonethreatening handler for deviant and off i went to draw shit for other people. She just asked me to never show her the stuff, and i could comply with that since i m not comfortable letting anyone else that i know see it, although close friends have been warned. I started to get some traffic, with it some commissions. I started saving money again, and thought of calling my therapist again to see how we could work into improving myself or my life, since i ve never stopped having suicidal thoughts. Then my ex let me know that she was having a hard time being there for me, she made me feel as a liability and cut contact with me completely. And i had a meltdown, she had been my closest friend through the whole ordeal and now she leaves. So instead of calling my therapist to improve myself, i tell her i feel miserable, wronged, sad, and still want to die. I want the pain to stop, I am more scared of keep hurting than of died, a week before a roof almost fell over me and i did not even react. I am numb to that, but i do not like hurting I am tired of that. I am tired of this, so why should i drag this on? And now I also understand that I feel emotionally alone, and even if a stop feeling hurt, that will not change easily. TLDR: random rant and followup to last post. My world just got smaller (follow up)",Suicidal
8513,Soo umm i am a 15 year old studying in 11th (I know its pretty young) and was wondering what to do..I actually am pretty confused what to do I am not afraid to die but even if i die someday i wish it to be quick. After surfing through internet and much more I came to a realization that only studies matter in this world..If you cannot study your life can never be secure and you will face hardships. The constant nagging from parents to study and them always pointing out faults criticising us...(My parents are actually good it is just that on studies things happen.. they do not beat me but those petty fights and unknowingly pressurising me)I many a times get lecture from them about how important is future and why i need to work hard for the upcoming years. The fact is that i know it pretty well but i cannot find the motivation in doing it.. I love my family a lot it is just that( I am sorry its very complicated to explain) I do not even know why i am writing this post. I am just unsure what to do I do not want to commit suicide or anything as i know it will devastate the family and i also have a little brother whose life i do not want to ruin by dying I change topics very quickly as you can see by reading this post Its just like i do not know my true feelings..my true selfI am not able to concentrate right now and just umm never mindmy mind is going wobble Uncertain About Life,Suicidal
8514,"So many people post here. you are lucky if you get more than one comment. A lot of the time people just upvote and do not even say anything and that is if your post is popular. Normal posts have the opposite problem. Maybe a few comments but no upvotes. Oh well. I do not know maybe this post is stupid. I am probably wrong, I usually am. I just know that every time I come here, because I want to be with people that get it, I end up disappointed. And its ironic. Because this community is here so that we do not feel alone. But it honestly never helps me. Yet I come back. Either to leave a comment, to reach out to someone I relate to, or to a make a post that I delete immediately. All of which pretty much leads to more nothing. More loneliness. So yeah I just had to say that. And obviously none of you guys will even see this. But I hope that whoever does has an okay day. I am still trying to learn to celebrate the ok days, myself. Because those are my new good days now. I do not have good days anymore, but that is okay. I am trying to get by without doing anything to hurt myself or the people around me. If I manage to do that, then my day was okay and that is good. Too bad, when it rarely happens, its still never enough. But at least its better than the bad days. Posting here to try to feel better is almost as futile as living.",Suicidal
8518,"there is a plethora of ways I could kill myself at this moment, many of which would be pretty painless. Or at least, I would not be in the right mind to feel the pain if I were to commit.But I cannot do it.Is it fear? Is it that I still want to live? Nothing actually seems particularly wrong with my life, so is it just a phase? Am I trying to be edgy? I do not know. I am not even focusing on what the title of the post says, I just wanted to write something.Also just realized that I might have imposter syndrome, which is fun.I feel like I am just fucking things up for myself despite having everything I need around me. I feel like I do not deserve to contemplate suicide because other people have gone through actual, real pain. I am at a time where I should be finding focus, where I should be giving it my all, but everything I have done up until this point feels pointless and I feel I will never achieve what I want even if I tried now. I hate myself making things so much harder than it needs to be. And I hate myself for not even trying to make it better for myself. Can this even be called being suicidal? I do not know. I might be overreacting. But at the same time I want to die. I do not want to turn 18. But I am turning 18 soon and I do not know if I want to just end it before I have to face becoming an adult or if I should try to survive by then because I know that there is still a chance to improve. This is just a full on rant, no one's going to read this. I want to talk to someone, but I do not know if I can trust them. I am afraid to find out what would happen if people knew that I have these thoughts. Would my friends and family still love me? Would they see me differently? Where do we go when we die? Do we get reborn when we die? If I were to die, would ""I"" ever feel the sensation of having control over body and thought again? Is it worth finding out? Should I try now? Or would it just be endless nothingness forever for me? it is fucking cold. I have a hoodie on, but my body feels like there is chills all over it. I do not know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life buried in textbooks and nothing else and now I am crumbling under the expectation that I have to apply for uni, whether they will even accept me, why I did not do anything in the past few fucking months I had to do something about this worry. I am scared I am going to disappoint everyone, because I know I made them all believe in me. But now I feel like I am going to betray them by either fucking things up for myself or just ending it all. I do not want to sleep, and I do not want to wake up. I do not want to fail, but I just want to end it all. Who decided that life had to be this confusing? Who decided to give me this fucking brain that thinks these thoughts? I am scared to find out if I would actually kill myself before my birthday. it is only a little bit away. I do not want to put that burden on my family. I know that they love me. I love them. I am fortunate enough to have them around when I cry, so I do not know why I am even having these thoughts. I do not deserve to be like this. I wish I spent my time doing at least something else. Maybe then I would have a better idea of what life is about. Of whether or not my worries are even important. Whether I deserve to cry.This was a long rant. I doubt that one can even form a reply to this. I just wish I could pick something and stick to it - either try and give it my all or decide to end it all now.

8522,"I will not be able to experience what normal people do, yet I get to suffer a thousand times more. Every day. I waste my life knowing I waste it and I will not get this dream life I thought my life was going to be like the first 26 years I spent on this life.I am currently 27, about to hit 28 and I found out last September right before I was going to turn 27 that I had a mild autism. 5 years prior to that I got epilepsy and I have been isolated from severe social anxiety and depression since 2011, which is the year I was diagnosed with ADD. While born with a stutter.I grew up thinking only my stutter was the only thing holding me back yet I felt like a fucking freak. A mistake of nature. But that I was going to at least satisfy my interest in cars by driving them, have me &amp; my friends journey life together, go to parties, live my teens like a teen, have girlfriends, have a job and not have anything stand in my way apart from a bit of a bump in my speech. But that was not the case. At all. I have always been this very mute, socially awkward guy everybody is scared of. Until they talk to me and find out I am not that bad. But with my inability to read so much socially I have to rely on others to start the conversation.This autism answers many questions. There are a lot of things I do not understand with this world when it comes to the social stuff. it is just so damn frustrating, because even if I want to be social and have friends I just do not fucking know how to do it. I am so out of touch with so much on the internet despite fucking being isolated on it for 10 fucking years. Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels, music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstream/casual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything ""internet""/meme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside, so lacking in everything. And in these 10 years I have made so much progress outside with my social anxiety but I keep failing and making it the other way when it comes to online. Multiplayer games are pretty much impossible.

Before meds I would have bad days and good days with most days being a mix but on meds it just seems to dull the highs and the lows and I am just in a consistently low state. All I would have to do in the past is wait for the depressive period to pass but now I just feel so out if it. I went from things having little satisfaction to them nearly having none, it made me cut some bad habits but I have no motivation for anything now. I lost interest in music, video games, social media and more. On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine. I am assuming raising Sert is making my dopamine drop making my apathy worse. Curious if anyone else has experienced this. Feeling worse on medication",Depression

I have been to multiple doctors visits and lots of physical therapy but I am still not better. My job offered me a ""light duty"" position (sitting in a corner alone staring at a wall) and I did that for a few months hoping I would get better. I have not healed, I am still going through physical therapy and I feel useless. About a month and a half ago I gave up, I stopped going to work and I have probably left my house maybe 5 times for supplies other than that I have been in bed.

I feel like I cannot communicate with anyone and I do not know if I have undiagnosed autism or if I am just so socially anxious at this point after the last relationship I had (6+ years ago) called me a rapist and got me socially outcast by entire school (including the faculty) meaning they withdrew my mental health treatment and let me drown in my studies and blamed me for not pulling myself together but if I get angry at her I am violent so I definitely did it and if I do not then it must be true because no sane person would be okay with being called that. I had two guys try and beat on me as I was ordering drinks at my local for being a weird rapist freak and now I am banned for life for retaliating and everyone that was there definitely thinks its true.

8583,"This is going to be a long (and not first) post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man, and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves (they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to), I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant.

I thought Id I moved, Id be happy. I got both, but nope - I am still the same incompetent idiot who has made the same stupid decisions.All of my friends are not friends. My family sucks except for one person. I love my wife, but she is just completely incompetent. Everywhere I turn I am just filled with disappointment. I feel like I am stuck inside of a room that is just getting smaller and smaller. I cannot seem to escape this feeling and everything it hits me, it becomes more and more intense.I am not there yet but I am worried one day I am just going to make the decision I cannot undo.

I finish work, and I think about work. And when it gets too much, I drink 700ml rum and take 120mg of codeine in the home that il fall asleep. I have to work from home rn, and I just cannot do it without staring hopelessly paralysed at my computer screen thinking about why and how I have got this depressed. I was an alcoholic when I met my girlfriend, drinking 1.5l of whiskey, rum, or whatever the fuck I felt like drinking that night.

I am not here to tell you my life story, as its not important. There are many of us who deal with this plaque in our minds, and I cannot help but wonder if this is some cruel way of self defense. I feel way too strongly on all fronts, I am incapable of of emotions that are small, its 0 or 10000 at all times. Into adulthood I have told myself I have made progress, with my behavior. My main coping mechanism with life is to learn about it, I decided at some point in my earlier youth that this is how I am going to solve my internal issues, with knowledge. Turns out knowledge is power but what was failed to mention is that not everyone can handle that power. I can now explain why on a chemical and biological level, I feel the way I do, and it only makes things worse nowadays. I have tried to take on a hedonistic mindset to circumvent the already dark thoughts with the peace that well its all essentially pointless.. but I am not a hedonist, and as much as I say I *do not* care I really do care at the umpteenth power. Its fucking hard. Especially when you have no one to go to. When you do not feel comfortable enough to speak about your thoughts because the people who are supposedly there for you, cannot be bothered- and its not their fault. We have all these words and concepts to wrap things up in a neat little bow and capartamentalize things until they are in boxes so small we act like we forget they are there.

I feel pathetic saying its too much effort because its literally over zoom but its just too much. I do not feel like talking about my problems anymore. I just feel like forgetting about them. she is a lovely therapist, but I just do not want to deal with this anymore. I just feel so sad lately its almost becoming to the point of numbness.

I hate brushing my teeth, my room and bathroom are disgusting, I cannot even find the motivation to make myself food anymore. I am in so much debt right now, and my boss was talking to me about getting a promotion at work and then she just went over and handed it to someone else. I just want to disappear.

8605,"Well guys, I need some help. Like I am seeing a licensed therapist, but thru talkspace as I cannot afford any therapy in my town...and I do not have a car due to anxiety. Well, this therapist is new to me, but before I came to her I was looking into short term disability. And before, I thought that maybe I could just tough it out. I am one to kind of push on through. I think that because of my flair for the dramatics, I do tend to downplay and gaslight the fuck out of myself when I am depressed. When I lost a job opportunity it got bad. I relapsed and started SH again. Which is something I do not like about myself. I was clean for about three months, but lately my job has been really hard on me. We started with 50 workers in my position, there are now 8 left....only 7 months later. I have even gone as far as nearly getting into an accident as a passenger, and being disappointed I came out unscathed. I wished something would happen. I do not enjoy weekends because I know I am going back. And the people I speak with are lovely, but I am incapable of thinking straight and you know when you are just getting BAD again. And I have no idea what I am supposed to do. My therapist said I would qualify, I have to talk to my pcp about it, but I feel so guilty. Everytime I get on the phone to talk to someone about it, I burst into tears. it is so humiliating to know they have got me crying for an hour recorded begging them to just ""Bear with me, I never do this. I am so sorry, I do not know why I am crying!"" I just need help. How did you get the STD approved? What should I expect? Please, please, no negativity.

I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money).

I have a lot of oxycodone, benzos and dissociatives I am thinking about taking all of it to have a chill death.I am thinking about writing a letter for my family so I will not have to deal with them while I am still alive.I am convinced that death is an amazing feeling because I have had near death experiences from mdma and stimulant use, it was amazing I felt a reconforting feeling and all was love.I got too much childhood trauma from the time my mom died from cancer, I do not even remember her voice and face... Anyway I am planning on doing it this week end I hope I will not miss.Fuck this world fuck my life fuck everything it is over. I am done with this shit",Suicidal
8640,"I do not think it matters what I do but I will never matter to anyone. All I am good for is to pay bills and work... My spouse took me to this place he would been raving about, he had taken my daughter a few weeks back. We went and he acted nervous or like he was waiting for someone or maybe he was just embarrassed to be seen with me. Thinking back he walked behind me or not near me the entire time. Then yesterday while I was working he went back again. What bothers me more is he, who does not even like Chinese, kept pushing how he would go there to get ME food. I was not asking for it, I did not care what food was purchased. I felt manipulated but also was in the middle of work an it did not seem like the time to pry. I do not want to stop him from being happy either. It feels very manipulative to me. When he came back he was happy an ate and went back to sleep. He spent the rest of the evening on his phone till I went to sleep then ""had trouble sleeping"" and stayed up all night. This has become a cycle, apparently he only gets good sleep when I am awake. I keep thinking he is going to leave since last fall. Everyday I am prepared for him to tell me how he does not love me, that he never did. Every time he takes me somewhere public, as I push my cart I think is now when he is going to drop the ""It is whatever you want"" statement with 'because I am leaving you"". He has started saying the it is whatever you want,, what makes you happy, ect. These phrases combined with the fact that he will not even come near me. I have been here before... I am trying to get more hours at work and you know accept it. He looks disgusted when he looks at me, he does not want to be anywhere near me and there is no amount of putting lipstick on this pig to change it. My parents could not love me. My grandparents could not. How could anyone else want me in their life? I am just not good enough for anyone. I Will Never Be Good Enough",Depression

8644,"I cannot help it but feel jealous about my other friends moving on in their lives. they are planning and packing and ready to further their studies overseas so so far away from our home country and I am mad. Mad that they do not have a care in the world that they are leaving their friends and family behind for a few years or maybe more if they stay back there to start working after uni. I am mad that it was so easy for them to make the decision to study overseas because they are mentally healthy and can make productive and positive changes in their lives with no trouble at all. I am mad that they are excited that things are going to change in their lives while I sit here wanting to die over every little thing that upsets me. I am mad that they have no financial troubles and can afford living and studying overseas for years when it was already hard for my parents to sustain my studies in my own country. I am mad that they are outgoing enough and will probably have a great new social life there and merge with the new cultures and dating life when dating has never been a serious thing among us friends in my home country before.

8645,"It feels like everything is just a blur now. it is there and then it is gone like it is nothing. It feels never-ending and way too short at the same time. I have not felt like this until the last 2 years. I have dealt with depression for as long as I can remember, but it is never been this bad. It really sucks cus I feel like I cannot truly appreciate the time I have with others. I have been suffering for a long time. I have honestly given up at this point, and the only reason I still try to push myself and progress is for other people. I know I need to love myself and treat myself better, I am trying, really. I have been trying, but I have never tried so hard in my life. it is so hard. I only ever talk to 4 people, which I do not have a problem with at all, but despite having these people in my life, I feel so alone in this world.

I do not know what to do, and I do not know why I am posting this really. I have been trying to keep it to myself. When it gets bad I hold the gun in my hand, look at it, and just think. I do not know exactly what I am thinking in those moments, there is so much running through my head. I wonder, if there was no one on this earth I loved or cared for, would I be able to do it?

8652,"I am an extremely introverted homosexual boy of 18 living in an extremely homophobic, judgemental society where gays are subjected to be killed if they ever come out, so I basically have no future other than living a lie in fear, hiding my feelings forever and never getting to love in my entire life. I used to be a very bright student who scored all A grades during my secondary education but ever since I started my high school, my grades have been drastically dropping because I am depressed all the time. I come from a big family with a history of bright minds and all my cousins, siblings and peers are all extremely well performing, meanwhile I am being a disgrace to my family. The pressure on me is immeasurable. I basically have no other talents, I have a weak, skinny body and I am not at all good at any sports either. In my attempts to search for something I am good at and as an attempt to hide my sexuality, I started going for basket-ball practice with some boys (because I found the game compelling), but only felt a burden to them and the only one who did not show any improvement in months, so I quit it. I do not even know what my career would be and what to try for even if I considered to live an unmarried life (which is again risky because I will be constantly judged). My social life is also non existent because I have just 2-3 friends who I talk to, and not one of them is close enough for me to share any of these with. I tend to distant everyone because I fear they will know my truth. I am also very insecure about my looks and my body so I have ceased to go out whatsoever unless necessary. I was also bullied back then at my hometown for having a feminine attitude until I got extremely sick and my family had to move to the city for better treatment for me, and ever since I have refused to return to my hometown even for a vacation. That said, I am also a sick person with a weak immune system and my family pays too much for my health care, for my studies etc and I do not think any of it is worth it. I also recently did a huge mistake, which is dating a girl who confessed to me, as an opportunity to change/hide my sexuality or in case someone is suspecting I was gay, only to hurt her due to lack of affection from me. I could not bear hurting her anymore so I broke up with her, but could not give a good reason for it, and it turns out she still loves me to this day and is constantly getting hurt. My siblings, parents have no idea what I am going through and often mocks me and jokingly comments on how I am good for nothing, not like other boys, ugly, etc. So I often avoid interacting with them either and isolate myself in the room for most of the time of the day. In short I am an ugly good-for-nothing living a lie in fear with no future yet with a lot of pressure on me. Thanks for reading. I did not have anyone to share this with",Depression
8653,"The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing, in so far as it stands ready against the accidental and the unforeseen, and is not apt to fall. ~ Marcus AureliusHow many of us, do I wonder, have felt the physical thrill of playful fighting with another as a child? Testing your strength against your father, perhaps your mother, as a child? Or play fighting with friends using sticks as magnificent swords of truthiness, and imagining the jungle gyms as your castles?As a child we all desire to be someone magnificent, no? Someone grand, who can fight the monsters and demons life throws at us, and be a beacon of hope and love for our fellows. Or mayhaps that might just be me?Because, as a child, there comes a time when we realize we are not so magnificent, we are not so powerful and full of divine strength and wisdom. We as children are faced with many moments where we are utterly helpless, and must rely on the love and kindness of others to get us through the day. I would say that we are children still, and always will be, until death teaches us our last lesson. I have come to realize that not one of the so called ""adults"" that surround me, truly know what they are doing. And I say that in a sense of, what they are doing with life, more so than what they are doing in their field of work or with their hobbies. I say that we are all still children, struggling our way through something that no one knows about, for what truly is life? What truly is the reason we have come into being?Have you ever had a child ask you question after question? Why is the sky blue? Why is the grass green? Why do I breathe? Why do I eat? Why am I alive? Why? Why? Why? it is like they are wrestling your mind this time, instead of testing their strength against yours. I worked, for a time, in a children's rehabilitation center for those who had been sexually assaulted, had sexually assaulted others, were addicted to drugs, had anger issues and have murdered. Children. Some were adolescents, some were only 12 in age and had been passed through the system because their mothers and fathers could care less about them. Why does not my mother love me, I heard once. I had not an answer. I did not know who this child's mother was because she never bothered to come visit. All I knew was that she had issues of her own, nothing excusable mind you. The child clung to me because I had answered so many of their questions before, but I had no answer then. It was only days later he was begging me not to let the police take him away. It broke me, because I did not have an answer then either. I digress, I live in a past moment. I state this because these children were wrestling their demons, but no one had taught them how too. No one had cared enough, it seemed to me, because no one wanted to, or truly knew how to, handle them. Granted there were maybe two others besides myself that wanted to do their best for the children, but its easy to burn out against a system that only cares about the money these troubled youths bring them. I do not ignore their transgressions, never that. But these were children. They were wrestling against traumas no one bothered to show them how to handle. They were mimicking the so called ""adults"" in their life they were told to trust. They were doing what was done to them. It made me truly understand that every other human being might be wrestling against their own demons, and with no one in their corner, how can one expect them to face the hundreds of opponents and circumstances that life always throws at us?Do you wrestle without knowing how to wrestle? Yes, that is how you learn. Is it easier when someone that you can trust helps you, teaches you, and shows you how to wrestle? Yes. What I am saying is there are a thousand, thousand ways to fight something. You learn alot of that on your own, and you may not know there is a better way to do it, until someone comes along and bothers to show you.My final point, is, as Marcus Aurelius states, humans, animals, organisms, will wrestle with many things in their attempt at life. Or in other terms, to live is to struggle. Knowing that, should we not all attempt to make it easier on others? Knowing that you yourself have been through many matches where you were outnumbered, with no one in your corner, can you truly blame yourself for just trying? For when the bell tolls, it signals your match is at its end. So Live. Struggle and survive. Wrestle, fight, war against life. Do not fall , stand tall and rage, rage against the machine.And stop being so damn hard on yourself For whom the Bell tolls, the wrestler, the pacifist, the young and the old, the struggling, the peaceful, the villain and the bold.",Suicidal
8659,"My life is nowhere near as bad as the Syrian refugees, or the quadriplegics stuck in their iron lungs. At the same time, almost everything about it brings me deep dissatisfaction. My family is dysfunctional to the peak and I oftentimes feel mistreated by them. My mother, especially, offers me little empathy and takes out all of her anger on me. I hate myself as well. I am short, skinny and I hate my hair. My hair is embarrassingly important to me and it rarely ever looks good anymore, I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I am socially awkward and have no friends in school or even on the internet. I suck at school and despite my efforts have little future prospects. I am from a country with mandatory military service and I know that I am exactly the kind of wussy, quiet guy who gets tormented there. My biggest ambition in life is to leave my country, hopefully for America or Canada, but with the harsh immigration laws and my lack of a STEM inclination it will be near impossible. I seriously do not know what to do with my life. I am too much of a pussy to end it, not because I am scared of death but because I have the pain threshold of a piece of paper (despite having chronic illness for most of my life lol).

I had just picked up the movie Spiral and was wanting to watch it with my dad the next night since we were both big saw fans. I went to sleep and the next thing I know my family was waking me up saying he had a heart attack while on a walk with the dog. We rushed to the hospital, where they told us they could not bring him back and he was gone. It felt like such a surreal moment, like none of it was even real. I saw his body and cried so fucking much, but it is like it has not fully sunken in yet. It probably will though soon. And when it does.. I think I am finally going to do it. For the past several years I have been struggling with bad dpdr and depression, and because of it I have been avoidant of a lot of stuff. I have gone out less and less, talked to people less, even going out places with my family. Anytime they would go somewhere and asked me to come I would say no and just stay home. I wish I could take back all those times. Wish I would have not been such a lazy piece of shit and actually made the effort to get better and spend time with them. If I had actually said something, or went to a doctor about it, and not waste my life by sitting around doing nothing, avoiding it and avoiding them. Wish I would have done more with him. Wish I would have done more with all my family. A couple weeks ago I told him a bit about some of my problems, and I promised him I would start going out more and try to get better.

Then a few days later they force me (Literally pull me by the arm) to be in a picture with them that is not even important and I instantly lost all my trust in them.I remember running to my room afterward and bawling my eyes out. I did not even want to look at the picture. I know it is not even that big of a deal, but it really affected my ability to open up to people because I felt that no matter how supportive they act, they will never really take anything I say or feel seriously and I just felt like the biggest wuss ever because, I mean, it is just a picture, right? why the hell am I so scared of a picture?Of course, this is not the only thing I am dealing with.

I do not even know what it feels like to be happy anymore or anything else that gives me happiness. I have given up on everything that I liked. I am just slogging through uni because I have to. I have no friends, no emotional support and a boyfriend whom I am terrified of. I lie to him about being okay all the time because I know he will fight with me if I say why I am not doing well and it will end up ruining whatever time I spend with him which in turn will ruin my head even more. I want to die I just want to end it. I have been pulling it so far only because of my dog. he is the reason I have to live but nothing feels okay. This was not supposed to happen, this was supposed to be the best time of our lives. I am 20(f). I was bullied throughout my teenage years by school mates and before that my relatives. I have been subject to sexual abuse multiple times as a child and the perpetrators unharmed and successful right now. I am faking it for everyone. I just want to stab myself in the neck. I have attempted a few times before and failed. I fail at everything. I am broke, useless, ugly, alone, fucked up, numb, a burden to everyone. I want to delete myself (TW: mention of suicide)",Depression
8708,"My best friend since 8th grade left me recently. My current best friend who is my only friend left started talking to her abusive and manipulative ex, who sabotaged and ended my best friend's romantic relationship after a couple weeks after he came back in her life. My girlfriend seems colder towards me. I am expected to finish so many things and I am not making much progress on them. My family's expectations of me are too high. I have been depressed for years and have social problems. I know this all seems very mild and i guess it is. I just have a thing in my head gnawing at my sanity. I feel so lonely, so isolated. I am trying my best not to hurt myself again or attempt. But its so hard. So so so so so so so hard. I am trying, I promise I am trying. I am scared. I do not know what I am rambling on about. I do not know why i am. I am just so scared. I am sorry for this entire thing. I am sorry. I know everything I said sounds very small and irrelevant and i guess it is but the main problem are not those its just my mind. I feel like its just a stormy blurry mess with so many bad thoughts. The outer stuff are just jabs but the inner stuff is the uppercut. Does that make sense? I am genuinely terrified. I do not know. I am sorry I do not know..",Suicidal
8709,"Life is all shitty thing after shitty thing. you study for a degree that you do not really care anymore bc the environment is so stressful for so little knowledge payoff that it just seems like ur wasting everyone is time, + the school fucks up ur schedule even if you try to stay at the top of ur game, even tho you feel like ur not learning anything useful, specifically to not have problems with that, and now you cannot even try to change classes even tho they are simply STILL HIRING the ppl who should have been teaching you since semester started weeks ago. And then you graduate to work in an ok career, will not get much, but at least I am going to be able to have a job, just to feel like you have not actually learned a dang thing which forces you to go BACK to that academic setting that makes you want to actually commit ever since you were in school being the butt of everyone is joke, while still trying to manage working because you have to get out of ur parents house as soon as possible to live in whatever shitty place you can get if you want to cut an inch off your hair. Even tho ur parents were living at your grandmas ur whole childhood and she did not give a shit what they did with their bodies, you do not get the same range because of, take a guess, fucking politics! That are not getting any better bc no matter what fucktards get in power you are still going to be discriminated against for the rest of your life on at least 3 dif bases and the people who fight for udont actually, they just want ur vote. you are probably going to be alone also because the person you love is also dying to go back to her home state, one of the less diverse regions in the country and wants to live moving places whereas with you that just sounds like a lot of planning and uncertainty and a lot of planning and uncertainty sounds like even more stress + mocing around w/ ur profession that is not that easy (but hey i got no ambition anyways so maybe that can be arranged).

8710,"I wish I could start over again. I feel like I missed out. I feel like I have not developed. I am generally content, but only when there is absolutely no pressure on me. As soon as there is even a smidge of pressure and am alone I lose control over my emotions and stress out over everything.I guess I should write a bit about myself. I am 22, have asperger syndrome, live with my parents and attend university (forestry major). In primary school and highschool everyone called me smart. All my live I kind of strolled through it with no resistance. I was happy. I never had trouble with anything. But once I entered university that gradually changed. Suddenly things became hard, people had expectations of me. I have to know what is to come months in advance and prepare for it.I feel fake. I do not have the passion for foresty my other classmates had. I only chose this major because I kind of liked biology class in highschool. But I never had a passion for it. In highschool I could just stroll along and do fine, but that just does not work anymore. Everyone wants me to know what I want. I do not know what I want! Or its more like I do know what I want I just want an easy life. An easy job. I wish I joined a college instead or maybe some kind of trade school, maybe I could have learned carpentry or plumbing or how to fell trees. Id be happy just working under a boss, 9 to 5, just do as I am told. I could have had my own home by now if I did that. Id be able to come home after work and do something else. Play some games, watch TV, maybe get into a new hobby like reading or writing, maybe try dating. I cannot do any of that in college. I am constantly anxious and overwhelmed and I cannot pay attention and I do not know what to do and I fear that all jobs in this field will be equally stressful and exhausting.Despite the trouble I described I largely made it through all my classes. I actually only have 1 test that I need to resit. But I do not want to do it anymore. I wish they never put the idea in my head that I am smart. I do not feel smart. I feel like an idiot that cannot handle the real world. I am so exhausted from looking for internships. I am so tired from having to do a large project each semester along with having to learn for multiple huge tests.I cannot quit university now. That would kill my mother, she is so worried about it. I can feel it in everything she does. So that is what I want to do. I want to at least finish university, and then I will see what I do.I wish I could do my entire life over again knowing what I know now. Id do it all so differently. Id spend more time being active, going outside, moving, learning new things, learning how to deal with adversity, Id find something I am passionate for or at least something I could enjoy doing as a peaceful job.I hope this rant is not against the rules or anything. I read them and it seems fine. Writing down my emotions and regrets like this makes it easier for me to process my emotions. But I do not know how long I can go without another emotional breakdown from my mounting anxiety. Either Way thanks for reading. Not sure if depressed but... Please hear me out. My negative emotional outbursts have been getting more common.",Depression
8734,"Throwaway because yeah.So I moved in with my partner around 7 months ago. He has both a cat and a dog who are lovely animals and I generally do not have any issues with them. But recently his dog has started pooping and being sick in the house on an almost daily basis, normally overnight. it is not health related or anything but just because she is an older dog. She gets her walks and let out for frequent toilet breaks. Now, I am the one who gets up first every morning so I have to deal with the mess, and I will be honest it is really fucking with my head.I do not wake up great to begin with due to my fucking awful mental health but this can send me into this feeling of white hot rage. I generally keep the anger to myself and smoke a cigarette but sometimes it can lead to an argument. it is making me not want to leave my bed in the morning and I have worked really hard to be able to do that on the best of days. I do not really know how to deal with this and it probably just sounds really petty and stupid but I needed to vent so thanks for reading regardless. Mental health and pets.",Depression

I get suicidal sometimes, but that would be selfish. But I cannot see the point anymore. What am I doing with my life? I am loved, I think. Just little things affect me a lot sometimes, like a bullet I think. it is not fair on people who care for me if I die, but it should not be like that. I wish I could just erase my existence, like stop my parents from conceiving me. that would be cool. I think I am overreacting, but I am a sensible person. I tried getting help, but my gp never got back to me. It sucks because I got accused of that I do not help myself. I tried, and I did help myself. do not accuse people who are struggling, I never do that because I know it has bad implications.

I am not even sad that I am suicidal, I am just pissed that I know I am too stubborn to change. it is not like I do not want to change, I have wanted to get better for like 3 years but no matter how much I try or how close I come, I always end up being the same asshole who puts on a facade for everybody he knows so that nobody has to worry about him which only leads to him trying to kill himself. it is happened 7 fucking times, you would think by now I would try to stop this trend but whoopdi-fucking-doo I am unable to change and fetishize my own sadness as a result. I unironically said that I am happiest when I am at my lowest, which is so fucking stupid but it is not even wrong!

I started getting psoriasis at like age 16 and I feel like it traumatized me. Going to glass with a hoodie and the teacher telling me to take it off. Just a lot of embarrassment and shame. Not being able to talk to girls and if I would hang out with girls I would go straight to the friend zone on purpose. I have trauma from being toddler too. My mom used to tell me I am just like my biological father and at the time I could not understand but then my step dad came along and that is when I started the pieces together. I feel like Ill never be as smart as him. Over all I have a lot of child hood trauma plus the psoriasis makes it even worse I do not want to meet new people I am venting sorry but does anyone know anyone with psoriasis that got rid of it I feel like getting rid of it will help a lot. will not solve all my problems but at least I can be my self again.

8748,"My girlfriend recently broke up with me, shortly after starting an internship out of state due to a plethora of issues, including my mental health struggles. Many of the issues she stated are issues I did not know she has, and had I know, I would have worked to fix.I am trying to do anything to mend the relationship, as I love my girlfriend and I acknowledge what I have done wrong, but she states she wants space for a bit and wants to see if I can be the boyfriend she deserves.I do not know what to do. I have made my fair share of mistakes, and I am more than willing to admit it, but I feel absolutely destroyed because we both put so much love into the relationship. It just feels like a switch was pressed, and everything vanished the second it occurred. My girlfriend went from stating she loved me more than anything to being openly critical of me, and it now makes me confused as to whether or not any of those feelings were true, or if she is simply upset and truly does need space after my behavior over the past month.I did not handle the distance well, and it did send me to the mental hospital, amongst other things. I plan to seek out counseling and begin the process of working on myself, but I do not want to have to lose someone I seriously care about. I moved my entire life over here to live with her and pursue our relationship, and all I want is for her to be happy.I feel like all I do is push people away and make things worse, and that I am being gradually erased by everyone I know.

My partner shows when they are down, everybody will know it. They will complain all the time and not really talk to me, and it will be like that everyday for days. They wanted to move to another country to study and and I chose to go with them as I could not handle the relationship to end. I studied hard for an exam to be able to get in and gave a lot of effort, just for them to tell me that they will be depressed there too, and do not know why the changed countries in the first place and so on. It is something they really wanted and now that they got it they are not satisfied .I know what it is like to be depressed, so I am not saying everything should be fixed, but nothing is appreciated and everything is being complained about, and I try so hard. I am numb and tired but even when I am at my worst I will still talk to them and try my best to make them laugh and smile. I am not actively suicidal but I wish every night to not wake up. Sometimes they even say that a lot of their negative emotions come from me and my family situation, which I cannot change. It is like no one has it as bad as them.

8752,"I will try to keep my story short; but I am also venting.My partner has suffered from depression for most of her life. She has endured child sexual abuse and never healed, and every time she got hurt throughout her life it just deepend that wound and reinforced the idea in her mind that people are abusive and out to hurt each other.Because of certain events her depression has gotten worse throughout our relationship. At first it was anxiety attacks, or perhaps she hid the other stuff from me then. Now I can see she is worse than ever after a relative died. She feels she is a burden to everyone, and mostly, she feels there is no hope, that she has been suffering like this for decades, and that there is no hope for her to ever get better and live a normal life.Her average day is being constantly on edge and scared of everything. I can see in her eyes she is just exhausted. Some days she just lies in bed, stiff as a board just looking at the ceiling and crying repeating ""I do not want this anymore"" over and over softly.Recently talks of ending it have become somewhat frequent. I cannot force her to go to a health clinic, and I am in that situation where if I call them to pick her up she will not trust me again or experience it as another betrayal. In the end they will release her within a week or two and it all starts again, but then I will not be near to support her and that might be more dangerous.The other side of the coin is that I am also just a human. I am overworked, I get tired, I get annoyed sometimes. it is a lot to carry for me and I realize I am just not everything a person with severe depression could need. I am not always soft and understanding, I am not always right there to hold her hand. I feel for her, and this situation is in my head all day every day, but selfish as it is, I am also at that age where people generally go through a lot of big milestones and I have plans and goals for the future and they are all on hold. Even though her safety is more important right now, I do feel frustrated because it feels like my life is so uncertain and stagnant.I just do not know what to do or how to deal with this situation.I do not know if I am even a good thing for her. Sure I comfort her when she has anxiety attacks, and I do what I can to be supportive. But the very fact that we have a relationship is also putting pressure on her. She feels like she is not a good partner, like she is ""withholding"" sex from me. Like she is taking away my chance at a good future. Even though I try to tell her that is not the case, she still feels like that. The sex is a non-issue. She is not a bad partner because she is going through depression I can live with all that. Underneath she is an amazing person that I love to spend time with. But she is right about the other thing, I suppose. What if her depression never ends? What if truly she cannot ever overcome it and live a somewhat normal life. Am I a horrible person for not being able to see that in my future? I have had that feeling for months now. I do not tell her any of this, because that is not something she should carry now. I am kind of just waiting it out and trying to have a good relationship and hoping that she does get better at least to some degree, so that those feelings end up irrelevant.I have so many emotions and most of them conflict some way or another.

8766,"Apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one, tl;dr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. I am just having a bad night and found this reddit, so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice.&amp;#x200B;My mental health struggles started when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin as well as told I should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. However, after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act (From what I hear, a common complaint.) Unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so I have been dealing with that untreated for awhile: Honestly I am so used to it at this point that the symptoms I deal with (I have always described is as not being able to make my head silent.) are so ingrained as normal that I forgot about it for a long time.&amp;#x200B;Aside from that, I was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. However, things changed when I was ten. Without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened: The first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. It also left me with deep mental scars which I have been told is a form of PTSD. I still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks, even just riding does and as I am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world, especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. The second thing was molestation and rape, something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. It only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. My mother only found out a few years ago when I broke down about it - the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. This is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. Depression, suicide attempts when I was younger, self loathing, hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it.&amp;#x200B;To add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male, I felt like I could not even seek help for it for the longest time. The stigma is not as strong now ah days, though it does still exist, that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well, I am sure you get the picture. Despite this I have seen doctors, I have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight, been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one.&amp;#x200B;This brings me all the current day. Despite all these issues I met someone who loves me. We got married recently. I have been happier then I had been in years, in all honesty she is the only person I have left anymore. My family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. But now that I have someone who depends on me as much as I do them...my mental state is getting worse. &amp;#x200B;I still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. My self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because I cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. The more she tells me it is alright, the more she tells me I do not have the worry about it, the worse it gets. The majority of her family hates me because they think I am a lazy sack of shit. I try to talk to her about it but I end up just making her feel bad, like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. I feel like I am spiraling out of control, I feel like she would be better off without me. I just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. My mind is so twisted with what I think is happening and what is actually happening, I almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. I thought for awhile I was getting better but now I feel more afraid and alone then I ever have before and I am doing it entirely to myself and I do not know how to stop it.My life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point, this one little miracle happened to me and I am going to absolute shit over it. I need help. I need advice I need something. I am terrified to lose her. I am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. I just do not want to be alone anymore yet I feel like I am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.So if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. Sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tl;dr PTSD, life long depression, ADHD, all relatively untreated. Managed to fall in love and get married. Was happier.

8781,"Any form of intimacy gives me severe nausea. To describe it in detail, you know that feeling you get when you are about to throw up? Your saliva is basically the consistency of water and you feel something being thrown up your esophagus? that happens, but i never throw up. i get on the verge of vomiting but it never comes. this would in turn lead to a racing thoughts, shortness of breath, and every other symptom of anxiety you can think of. This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was (talking, cuddling, kissing, or having sex), but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her (and have nothing go on between us) made me sick to my stomach, and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means, in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute (when the nausea happened i would step out of the room/car and walk around taking deep breaths) and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time, though. sometimes it was a little, other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all. Now, after breaking up with her a few months ago i have had multiple opportunities to even just hang out with a woman platonically 1 on 1 and i completely avoid it because it freaks me the fuck out. i do not want to have any form of intimacy anymore because i know how anxious and nauseous i will get. It just sucks because I am comfortable with like sending nudes and stuff and that is about it. i feel like such an asshole for even doing that because i know i will not be able to go any further than that.

Maybe I am just misremembering, or overthinking it because we have been friends for over a year now, maybe even two but I thought he was just telling me: Id rather be hanging out with her but you will do. I thought I could get over it, because I immediately just shrunk into myself when he said it but I cannot.

My rational side is saying I am just overthinking it, we have been friends for a long time. It was just conversation, and a miscommunication at worst.

(i was good at tennis, but i know my limitations so i told them i give up) they blamed me for months on end for ruing there dreams and money, i should have told them when i was younger but if i did i was scared what would happen to me as my parents hated/despised my existence if i was no use to them. Then i aimed to become a doctor, year 11, age 15, after breaking up with my first girlfriend who was my emotional scapegoat since my parents hated me, our relationship was toxic and my first love chose another individual because i was too much of a coward to ask her out. During when i had a girlfriend year 10, my parents would antagonise me that i should not fall in love, it ruined my tennis career and education. During my relationship with my girlfriend i realised the way my parents where treating me, my lack of social awareness and how enclosed my life was (did not know youtube, anime, insta, etc. till i was 15). So i slowly began to shut them out of my life, both parents would antagonise me, act like my support, but then immediately backstabbed me when they had the chance, blame everything on me and have me as a common enemy (this was norm in my life and still is). My parents still antagonise me for falling in love to the point, I am so depressed that my friends slowly forgot about me and the only form of happiness i still have left is anime, lego or games.My parents antagonise me on how successful they are and how much of a disgrace i'am compared to them, I am a freeloading leech that takes everything for granted, whilst offering nothing in return. The way my parents brought me up i have speech impediment (stutter and i cannot formulate sentences quickly and i struggle to talk), i get bullied and still laugh, get emotional scarred and people still expect me to smile. I only laugh and smile at school while i had friends, but since i graduated i have no friends and no one talks to me, except my parents who ostracise my very existence as a mistake everyday. Also during a biology class after receiving crappy marks in chemistry and getting scolded by my parents, i slit my wrist with a scalpel, my friends at the time took me to the nurse and i had some medicine/band-aid applied to my wrist, scared of what my parents will say to me i hid it, when i woke up, my band-aid was gone and i was sure they saw it since i live in a small apartment i sleep in the same room. Come morning it seemed as if they did not care or wanted to care about my injury. I wanted to kill myself since the age of 5, i prayed i would die everyday to relive my parents burden f having me, i was too afraid to end it myself, so I would hope i got into a freak accident or was killed, unfortunately nothing has happened yet.I go uni now and study software engineering, having received a atar of 77.85, which was a far cry from studying medicine. I want to make friends at uni but my speech impediment, how i look (I am not exactly what you call a good looking guy, i know I am ugly), but i still continue to hope on. I skipped over alot of my past because it is better left unknown. I just turned 18 yesterday, i was hoping i would die before turning into a adult, kind of disappointed to be honest, woke up immediately scolded for looking sad, i only had 2 friends remember my birthday, 2 family friends and my parents obligated wishes. As time flew more and more people forgot about me, which is not bad because i always wanted to be forgotten i guess. When cutting the cake, the asked me to smile, but i would not since i was sad i was still alive. They started to curse me like always for not being thankful for what i have, they always like to monitor what i do so they check my phones and stuff. I have a younger sibling who is blessed, they receive everything from my parents i wish i had, whom i also stopped talking to after my parents routinely check on my email, where they discovered me and my friends joke round calling each other names and stuff. One of my friends called me gay as a joke, which my sister called me infront of all her friends who are in highschool too. The only person who i had close relations with made me feel betrayed for putting trust in them. My parents made me ""reconcile"" with them, which i acted as i did, but never felt that they were sincere (happened 2 years ago). I am trying to get my first job at retail so i leave the house more and can contribute money to the family and am not a leech, but no one is hiring since covid and i have no work experience. So i need to wait until covid bans are lifted if I am still alive lol.Now to today, my parents spoke to me again about how much of a disappointment i'am, i make myself numb to pain by holding back tears and looking pan face all the time, but i cried for the first time to them for the first time in 2 years despite them ""calling me out"" for different things, even them all wishing i was dead and if they had known i was going to be born they would have aborted me or calling me a mistake. My parents said they probably made a mistake when they received there baby from the nursery, which broke my heart. I act stone face to hide my tears and sadness, but i did not say anything back to them, because whenever i did i would make things worse for myself by expressing my feelings. Imagine ur friend consoling you despite being reluctant, when you finally get consoled, there pissed at you for taking forever and things get worse. Like that so i just be quiet and only nod my head or giving 1-2 word answers. They feel no remorse and continued to talk to me. Later on one of them comes and asks me why i cried saying they were surprised, i choose not to say anything so they lecture me for 1 hr 30mins asking why, telling me there hardships and how much of a failure i am. Here i am now on the verge of decided whether to jump of my apartment or not, I have written and signed a couple of draft notes on what i done to my body after i die (donated to medical research or organ transplants), removes more burdens of my parents. Idk what to do sorry for wasting your time, this is more of a rant if anything. Thank you for your time and sorry for my bad english despite it being my first language. What do i do?",Suicidal
8797,"I am 15(M), lifes just begun. And I have already proven to myself that I will amount to nothing, nor in the present or the future. I am a loathsome, pathetic, miserable kid who has absolutely nothing going for him. I have no friends that I actually enjoy being around, no talent in any area. I am constantly disgusted by those around me and myself. I despise the world yet do nothing to change it. I despise myself yet do nothing to spark change in any area of my life. I truly believe that people like me deserve death, I am lazy, unmotivated, I have no reason to be severely depressed yet this weak subhuman garbage I have been birthed as feels like shit from sunrise to sunset. My incompetence pierces into every facet of my life leaving me unable to do even the simplest tasks, I can barely get out of bed in the morning, I can barely even brush my teeth. I have accepted that my death whether it be by my hand or otherwise will be filled with nothing but regret and wasted potential. I loathe the very concept of existence, I am so mentally fucked in the head that absolutely no progress can be made in my condition. My misery pales in comparison to others, my talent pales in comparison to others, my existence pales in comparison to others, my life is just a series of shortcomings and failures. There is no point in me living if I just taint the earth with my presence. I am disgusted",Suicidal

Never wanted to make a post but here it is anyway because I really want to vent it out without being known.Thought I would make a throwaway account but had no motivation to do so. it is so very difficult. Endless rows of days. If not for my mom, I would have been long gone. She, literally, is the only reason why I am still around. And she has not been doing great, health wise. I am a sore loser. Got no friends or people I could talk to or expect any emotional support. it is all my fault that things are like that though, besides people are busy with their own life.Tried journaling. It did not work. At. All. When I revisited what I wrote it only justified my thoughts. The thing is I do not want to hurt my mom. we are not exactly a functional family but my parents love me in the way they can. that is more than I could ask for, I guess. Anxiety and being gullible in general made me quit my decent and we will paying job 2.5 years ago. have not been able to get back because I have panic attacks in the interviews.

8807,"I have not relapsed this badly in a bit and I am sliding back down the rabbithole and I really do not want to because I know how far this can go and I fear if it will go further this time. I live in a country with strict covid restrictions and we are strongly encouraged to stay home. Dining in has been restricted and I have little excuses to go out besides saying I am going to a friend's house. My friends have been gracious enough to invite me over anytime I need to but my mother would make a lot of negative comments about me leaving the house in this pandemic and it just discourages me to do things/tell her that I want to go somewhere/ do something. I have been receiving negative reinforcements (snide remarks, talking behind your back, breathing down your neck parenting etc) since young and this has affected me a lot as a person and I have been trying to be a better person each day. I met a guy who loved me despite everything and tried to make me a better person too; he was my shelter and escape everytime my mum hits me with the negative shit. But recently he abandoned me and left me to fend for myself and he took the light away with him too. Today I signed up for a credit card and was nagged to no end by my mother, and was called stupid over something that I did my research for. And it hit me that things have always been like this since I was young. Everything I do is not right and everything I do is dumb and everything I do has to be controlled by her. And I am so drained. I have not cried like today in awhile; I know when it is a depressive cry. I need to leave this place and environment. I need to. Sliding back down the rabbithole",Depression
8808,"I know this sounds extremely melodramatic and like I am just over reacting... but I have been feeling like this for a while. I want to not exist. The only thing holding me back are my parents and grandparents, they will be so sad if I died. One of my best coping is sports. I do gymnastics, weightlifting and volleyball. And I love them. (Frankly the only thing bringing me happiness in my life). Its how I destress and release my anger towards myself. But I recently had an knee injury and its just been confirmed my mri, I have a complete ACL torn. The whole process of surgery and rehab will be 9-12 months. I cannot do what I love during those times and by the time I can get back Ill probably be much much worse and have to pick it up from scratch. I have been away from sports for 2 weeks now and already my mental sanity has taken a huge fall from its already super fragile state. I am also known as the sporty person and I do not know how Ill survive being in crutches in school. I just do not know if its worth it. To go through the process, without any coping mechanism. I want to kill myself now if save me the trouble, the mental stress. I just want to die. because I do not think life is worth it. I am so angry with myself and I just want to... dieI have been making so much progress coming out of covid in gymnastics and weight training but now... it was all for nothing I guess. I feel like I am being over dramatic but this was the last straw... the only thing kept me going in life. The only they kept my mental sanity in check. Plus many of my friends are from gymnastics and volleyball and now we will just drift apart... and people will think it was my fault for injury... I do not think life is worth it...

8810,"Have been feeling depressed for quite a while. A lot of it has to do with my future goals and career, just general anxiety and fear for the future. Will be entering college this fall and sorta feel weird about life. I have friends from hs but we do not really talk and I do not really have anyone in my life to talk to, or want to talk to. I am just overall very neurotic about my future career. Ill be going down a very difficult and long career path that I believe objectively is one of the hardest ones out there (medicine). I have been working really hard to get opportunities and building up my resume and stuff. While I am doing stuff I do like, I do not feel happiness in life. There really is not anything that brings me joy. I also feel bad about my body. Sometimes I look at old photos and feel really bad about how I have gained weight. I have struggled with an ED before but I do not have ed issues anymore, but it does not stop me from feeling bad about myself. And yea I just do not really feel anything, and I do not know if I want to seek professional help. Like overall I feel like the road ahead is going to be very difficult and tiring and I just want a break but I feel like I have not been working hard enough as I have been doing a lot of comparing myself with others lately.Just wanted to get this all off my chest.

8813,I was looking at some past friends social media and it made me realize even more how sad and pathetic my life really is. And yes before anyone says it I know social media is not real and only shows people the good sides and blah blah blah but still its clear these people are at least doing something in there life and trying to go after their dreams while I am just laying in bed..doing absolutely nothing for the past 4 years. Also I have no friends. I still really do not know why I have absolutely no friends like there are people who are absolutely shit and have tons of friends but I do not. At this point after this many years I have come to the conclusion I am just unlikeable for some reason. And I SWEAR to fucking GODDDD if someone tries to give me some advice on how to make friends. Trust me when I say I have done everything you possibly could to make friends. At this point I have given up and have decided to be friendless forever.

8815,"I grew up on a farm where I saw a lot of brutal animal death at a young age and on top of all this I witnessed my parents marriage and sanity almost dissolve. Thankfully they are still together but the beginning days of the dairy farm really gave me a wakeup call that my parents did not know everything and were not the best decision-makers. I am now 25, battling intrusive thought OCD for 7 years and often extremely depressed. I try not to show it but I really want to die most days. I am kind of known as the funny guy by those around me but that is all just ""put on"" when in social settings. I feel obligated to not plan such a thing as my own suicide, because I do care about my parents and siblings, but in regards to life itself, I just wonder what is the point?I do not necessarily believe in a heaven or higher purpose, and I despair at the fact that so much unchangeable pain and death has already happened. My ""friends"" that I have always seem to surprise me with their lack of empathy about certain things and joking attitude about things as painful and saddening as suicide. They do not know that its something that is always on my mind, but their jokes about suicide still hurt because it is a serious subject. I feel so incredibly trapped by life and so in pain by intrusive thoughts. I seriously cannot tell anymore where intrusive thoughts end and where my conscious choices and ideas begin. I am a visual person that is always seeing bad imagery in my mind of things I do not want, and its so persistent that I do not always know if its me. At this point, if someone asked me if I am a good or bad person, I would say ""Yeah, I am bad"", despite the fact that I have never actually ""done"" something to anyone. I do not tell anyone this but I often wish I had never been born at all when my mind is racked with guilt and confusion. I do not think I am mentally ill, but there have been some moments in my teenage years when I did start to slip down the path of total confusion, such as a time in which I thought I may be the same person as my father. Yeah, it sounds stupid, but I thought since we did have a lot in common and he did look a lot like me at my age, maybe we were actually the same person. I often just feel that I am not in control of the types of thoughts I have and I feel at a loss for words about the kind of aimless person I am now.But honestly one of the biggest things that bursts any desire to further myself for a better life, is the hopeless of isolation. I have yet to forge an actual close friendship in the past 10 years or more. This is excluding my siblings and parents. Something where both people understand and are open with each other. Yeah, I can spout to one of my ""friends"" some philosophical commentary on life, but that is just surface level crap. I have never dated and do not know if I have it in me. So a lonely life ahead sounds miserable too tbh.The stuff where I genuinely tell someone how I REALLY feel about my life, my pain, my hopelessness and my internal rage at myself never happens. I begin to tell them personal stuff because their seemingly trustful, but then I see that they really are not engaged, and they may not even be listening.Because I keep convincing myself not to commit suicide, I often instead find myself just saying ""I wish life was already over by now."" I mean, its going to happen one day. Why cannot it just hurry up already for me, since its always looming in the background like an inescapable punishment. I know I should not feel this way, and I am sorry for that, but as this reddit group already knows, this is one of the only places where some people can vent their frustration or share their pain in the hopes that improvement will come from fellow sufferers. I think I have some repressed anxiety from childhood that really comes out in despair.",Suicidal

8828,"One thing someone said to me after telling them some of the things I have been through is that I am actually one of the strongest people there is for getting through it and still being someone who spreads positivity. The thing is, I am not strong. Barley anyone knows everything that is happened to me or about the void its left in my heart. I keep it hidden. I am a goofy type of person, so I hide it with laughter. I try to make people laugh and do good things as a distraction. Doing these good things makes me feel better about myself for a short amount of time. Like I said though, I am not strong. I constantly let myself get triggered and start remembering the trauma. I get so anxious sometimes that its hard to hide, and I am so terrified of opening up about it to many of the people I care about because I am afraid of letting myself be vulnerable like that. I know its probably irrational, but I am afraid that if they know the full story, they will come to see me the way that I see myself as a result of it all. Yet on the contrary, whenever I get anxious and start having flashbacks and stuff, I want nothing more than to have someone to break down to and to be completely vulnerable with without having to worry about how it would change their perception of me. I wish I could just let it all out like a little kid, but that vulnerability terrifies me. It results in a vicious cycle that I am aware is completely self inflicted, I am like the author of my own misery. If I was actually all that strong, Id be able to talk about it in detail without tensing up and getting sweaty and anxious. If I was actually strong, Id be able to not worry about being vulnerable like that. The fact that I do not have that strength is part of what makes me loathe myself so much. Does anyone else relate to all of this? Are these signs of PTSD or depression, or is all of this normal for someone with trauma in their past? I cannot stop letting my past haunt me",Depression

My father obviously does not care and my mom is very close-minded and does not know how to communicate with my sister. I had to drop out of school and quit my job so I could stay home full time to watch my sister and make sure she is safe. I have taken her to the hospital several times and she stayed in the mental health unit for a few months but it has not made a difference. she is back home and I am constantly on edge because I am worried she is going to somehow hurt herself. I try my best to keep an eye on her and I basically follow her everywhere around the house. Everytime my parents find out she managed to cut herself under my care, or attempted, they blamed me for being careless. I love my sister with all my heart.

8849,"As the title says, the week of July 12th was one of the worst in my life. I feel completely defeated at this point and I just want to give up. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for the last 7 years, and, for awhile, it was helpful for me. We found a good cocktail of medicine that helped me feel normal, and helped me function with my day-to-day activities. But, around the end of May I noticed that my meds just were not as effective as they once were. I have to state that I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and PTSD since 2003. I have also been suffering from insomnia in varying degrees of severity since then as well. I cannot stress how absolutely miserable it is to want nothing more than to sleep and not be able to.So back to the 7/12. I had been visiting my family for awhile since I have been working from home for a year and half, and I did not want to be alone every single day. Plus, I missed our family dog dearly. So it was great to spend time with her. While I was home, I also got a dog for myself, just, the sweetest little thing. But low and behold, she was born with a genetic condition that requires she get a total hip replacement. that is going to be 8K after all is said and done. I do not have that kind of money. Not at all. Anyway, when I left to come back home to take care of things here, I left my dog behind because her surgery was scheduled back where my folks live and I did not want to stress her out with a lot of back and forth travel. When I left, I did not get an opportunity to say bye to our 15 year old family dog. I figured I was coming back for my dogs surgery in August, so Id see her then. And then I found out my family had to put her down on 7/12. That little dog meanteverything to me. I have been used and abused and discarded by people all my life. My family (not my nuclear family, but the rest), my friends, everyone. But that little critter loved me unconditionally. And now she is gone. And I did not get to say bye to her. Furthermore, my dog is slated for surgery on 8/12, one month to the day of the other dogs passing. And, while I am not superstitious, its still causing massive anxietyjust in case anything happens to her. When I got back home I found a new psychiatrist; Id changed insurance earlier this year. However, he does not accept insurance and its $500 a session. I researched psychiatrists in my area and hes highly recommended and rated. And I like him. However, the costyeahalso not helpful for my stress and anxiety. We also changed my anti-depressantwhich now costs me 400 bucks a month. Again, cannot afford any of this. My weekly therapy is $130. I earn a good amount of money but I happen to live in one of the most expensive areas in the US, so my income does not go too far. So I have just been panicking. I am in a ton of debt. I have been trying to do everything right to help better myself. But every time I start to make progress it gets derailed. I have gained about 90 pounds in the last year. And I cannot seem to lose it or change my dietary habits because its so hard for me to care when I feel so exhausted. My job sucks, I am paid 60% of what I should be earning in my field as an entry-level position (though I have been doing this for 7 years). I have started looking for other jobs but its just exacerbating my anxiety. Like, to the point where its crippling.

8853,"TLDR: they got worse but at least plan c is gone Basically I made a post at one point saying I had three separate plans and a whole lotta bad thoughts, so check that first for context.Good news is: plan c is no longer a plan. I cannot interact with people well enough to get a date in the first placeBad news: mostly bad news. The thoughts are still there and boy oh boy are they growing. So during a few meltdowns I have done a real bad thing where I just walk out and go as far away as possible, remembering plan A in the process. Now they have been nagging me to do it more outside of meltdowns - mall, grocery store, park; hell, we got in a car crash a few weeks ago (dw everyone is ok) and I thought to just start walking and hope no one notices. Literally the only thing that stopped me was the cops sowing up to assess the damage. Speaking of plan a, that is also been nagging more. Not much to elaborate there.Another thoughts been growing, the one that I have had it too good. Been noticing my appetites going down cuz I feel like I do not deserve whatever I am eating. More commonly with meltdowns Ill try to get rid of clothes, jewelry, phone, etc thinking only good kids get to have it. I hardly even want to go anywhere anymore cuz all the fun places are good kid things and I should not have that. Even the bed I am laying in while typing feels wrong to sleep in.I have lorazepam in case they get too bad but I always refused and threatened to take the whole bottle, and now I am legit afraid to take it in case I decide to go through with it 2am update on the thoughts and plans",Suicidal
8857,"So, I have a teenage brother who does not act his age but he is not sped or anything. I am about to turn 20 and he still wants to sleep with me. I feel uncomfortable sleeping with him (we both have our own beds) and I am in my mom's room since I am babysitting and he wants to sleep with me. I told him, you are not a little boy, go sleep in your room. I was told my depression was quite high and I tend to overreact sometimes but I just cannot control how I feel. I started crying from being upset and he still would not budge. My grandma said why I am so against it and I told her ""He mocks my depression every single time. You think I will feel comfortable sleeping with someone who mocks my depression?"" that is when both my grandma and aunt said ""it is all in your head. Control your feelings. it is just a minor thing, no need to overreact""I KNOW I am OVERREACTING BUT ITS NOT SOMETHING I CAN CONTROL. THEM SAYING ""ITS ALL IN YOUR HEAD"" MAKES ME BELIEVE THAT they are DISMISSING MY DEPRESSION AS SOMETHING SMALL. I FEEL REALLY HURT. I KNOW I ACT CHILDISH BUT I JUST cannot CONTROL MY FEELINGS. IT TOOK A LOT OF COURAGE FOR ME TO COME OUT TO SAY ""I HAVE DEPRESSION"" but i regret I ever did. They do not take my depression well. I attempted an overdose but they do not change their behavior towards me. Why did I ever decide to trust them?? All I ever wanted from them was to say they love me and that they will support me and take my depression seriously. Why is it that I feel that my doctor cares more than my family?? I really needed to rant so thank you guys for reading ""it is all in your head""",Depression
8861,"that is it really. I am on my last legs here and I do not know what is dumb and what is not. I am trans and I know I will *never* be able to come out of the closet but when I think about it even if I could what would that change? I blocked a bunch of my friends recently and plan to go back but am worried that is ruined forever with some of them and am kind of resigned to it. I understand if they do not forgive me. I was upset by something one of them said, I was upset at myself. They just asked me kindly not to make a certain kind of comment and I had a meltdown. I wanted to hurt myself so bad but I just got out of a therapy session about not doing that and it stuck in my head. I did not but I am not proud of it. I do not feel any better or good about it at all. I felt like I still needed to do something rash hence the blocking. I was so happy before and in a split second, I have crumbled to this familiar bullshit. I got out of a cult recently that my family remains firmly in, hence the fear of them. I cannot cut ties with them though, I do not want to. they are not bad people. I know they will never stop loving me no matter what and a lot of them suffer from the same things as me, depression and suicidal tendencies, they have kept me alive this long. I do not want to die. God, I do not fucking care if I live or not. I just do not see any other options. I have been doing okay with just hurting myself and am trying to balance stopping that without falling into suicide attempts. I feel like I have got to reach a certain level of fucked up before anyone will or should bother to help me. I want to be as pathetic as possible because if I get better people will stop being so careful when I still need it as much as they can offer. My throat is incredibly swollen right now from an illness. My friends made me care. I did not want them to miss me, I love them. I do not care right now. I am angry at them because I cannot afford to be angry at myself anymore. I would not survive it. I can either be an unpleasant, maybe even *bad,* person or a dead man. I do not want to die, but I do not believe I have a solution and I really would not care if I dropped dead right now. I do not want to kill myself, I could never stab or poison my body, but if I just stepped in front of a train or off a cliff I think that would be nice. I need someone to tell me I should not kill or maim myself",Suicidal
8863,"As I type all this out, I am certain that the final chapter to my story is coming to a close. I am so lost. So empty. So bewildered. I do not even know what I am feeling right now, let alone who I even am. I can barely formulate words to describe to you how mentally fucked I am. that is why it is taken me over 7 draft's and 4 month's to type this post out. I want to apologize in advance if I am all over the place here.I really miss being a kid. I was a charming fellow who oozed optimism. Everywhere I went, I radiated positivity. Perhaps you could mistake this for innocence? Regardless though, everything was so different then. The only thing that mattered to me was catching the latest episode of Ed, Edd, and Eddy. Never in a million years would I have expected to grow up and be worth less than the ground beneath your feet. Here I am at 21 and I have become, nothing. I do not have a car, I just got a job (and I probably will not keep it for much longer), I have no one to love or appreciate me, the little amount of ""friend's"" I have are slowly pushing me out of their lives, my credit is fucked. The only thing I have is Music. But even still, it can only go so far. Drowning out my thoughts in tune is great and all but eventually, I will be brought back to reality and my little fantasy will vanish.It does not help that I still live with my emotionally abusive, narcissistic mother. what is worse is that, realistically, she is the only remaining person in my life and because of this, I am forced to love her. But loving her fucking hurts. It feel's as if I am walking on egg she will's when I am around her. She constantly gaslight's and manipulate the fuck out of me to the point where now she has complete control over my life and emotions. Not only is everything my fault but she convinces me that I have said thing's to her and I cannot recall me ever doing so. If I try to strike up a conversation, she pays little to no attention to what I am saying what so ever, and then scolds me for not talking to her. She always calls me inadequate and weak. Whenever I mention a promise she made to me, or something hurtful she is said to me in the past, she acts like she has no idea what I am referring to and say's, ""...that does not even sound like me. I would never say anything like that to you..."". Everything she says to me leaves me questioning my past and rationality. Maybe I am a weak, lesser-human ass pussy that overreacts and exaggerates? As fucked as it sounds, at times I wish she would just bawl her hands up into a fist and let out all her frustration and anger onto me. But she does not. So instead, I take a blade to my arm and ""brand"" words onto it.it is incredibly difficult for me to describe my emotion's. it is almost as if my brain is like the physical manifestation of White Noise. Most of the time I feel so dissociative, my entire being is on auto-pilot and I do not really ""snap out of it"" until I am in stressful situations. But by then, anxiety ensues and I start trembling. Like now for example.Suicide has been the hand tugging at my shirt for as long as I can remember, as far back as my youth. I even attempted twice this year, and unfortunately I am still here to tell the tale. I know a lot of people attempt because they want for their pain to end. For me, it is a bit different. My pain will not end. As long as my heart beat's, I will forever remain this way. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. These thought's will never stop. I will never not be depressed and miserable. it is been almost a decade since I have been this way, and it will never end. I have tried almost everything: therapy, meditation, religion, hotlines, support groups. Nothing. Next time, I want to ensure my method will work. I do not want to survive and end up in a vegetated state or losing half of my face or what have you. Last month, I watched as my childhood friend was buried 6 feet under. He shot himself. Well, I take that back. I did not attend the funeral. My mom guilt tripped me out of doing so. Imagine what kind of shit friend I am. Pathetic. No wonder everyone is pushing me away.I have no idea what to expect when I post all this but...it is really late. I am not making any sense right now. If you managed to read through this bible's worth of text and hear me rambling and being a bitch, thanks I guess. Maybe someone might give a fuck. I have a treat for you. it is the only gift I can give this world: half decent taste in music. Listen to ""A Different Age by Current Joys"", the whole album. it is been on repeat as I have typed out all this bullshit. If you are as low as me, maybe this album will speak to you as it is done to me. me rambling a bunch about my life being so cruel.",Suicidal

I am not a human with feelings to them. anytime I am not masking myself.. by acting polite and taking their bullshit with a smile across my face, I am being disrespectful. and all hell raises when I am not being perfectly kind and helpful. people yell and throw things, my parents cannot control themselves. i have very severe depression, severe anxiety, ADHD and DID. that contributes to not being so happy around others. my family does not know me. they do not want to know me. i just want to be someone to them, i want to be understood. I am just talked down on, I am forced to do everything i do not want to. my dad told me to kill myself. my mom does not care whether i live or die. its not like I am some nuisance you would see on the worlds strictest parents or whatever.. i do anything i can to stay away from my family. i barely talk. i overanalyze what i say and do, before and after i.. say or do anything. I am not just careless with what i say, i do not go out of my way to upset people. every day I am finding a reason to love and care for my family, but they do not love me. i do not know what i possibly could have done to be treated like this. did i not put the dishes up when i was told to? did i not clean up the living room before you got home? is that why you want me to kill myself? earlier today, i told my mom that i think about writing her a letter every day at this point, that i do not want to be here. i asked her what she would do if i died. all she did, was point out how disrespectful i am. how i do not pay bills, how I am inconsiderate. she does not care if i die. my whole search history is looking up lethal doses for whatever medication i have access to. i want to slit my throat at this point, nothing i have will because a quick death. but cutting my throat would be painful. i do not have a car, cannot take myself to a tall building. the stove will not put out enough carbon monoxide to kill me. i want someone to kill me. i mean, I am only 15, pretty young to have to feel like this. well, I am getting a car soon, ill be able to get out. but i do not have my license, I am stuck here for now. and that is too much. this is all pointless. i had therapy going, it was helping. until my mom decided she wanted weed and cut off my sessions. no one cares. no one fucking cares. my parents treat me like shit, i just want to die.",Suicidal
8877,"so, this might be a little long. sorry about that in advance anyway.like the title said I have no idea what I am doing with my life, not trying to feel sorry for myself by posting this or anything I just do not know what to do anymore. I had a very complicated childhood, my parents never let me get an education. (and by that I mean not at all, I never did any school work, or even went to school at all when I was a kid/teen.)my spelling is almost nonexistent and no matter how hard I try I cannot seem to improve it (using a mix of autocorrect/google translate to write this out) and my math is awful, but I did manage to teach myself to read quite well though.I was not allowed to talk to other kids growing up and so I had no friends growing up and was not allowed to leave the house at all, only sometimes to go shopping with my dad or mom. and I went out even less after my father killed himself when I was 8.the first time I talked to someone/went outside by myself was when I was 16 and it was to get milk and other stuff because my mom just got too lazy and she could not be bothered anymore I suppose. as you probably guessed I have extreme social anxiety and can barely talk to other people even till this day.this might sound awful and I feel awful for saying this, but covid is probably the best thing to ever happen to me I was able to move out with one of my sisters because of government benefits, because of this I was able to look inward and able to see how badly I was treated by my family and to see that I might have a lot of mental problems because of this.I do not know how I thought my home life was normal, but I had my mom calling me useless because I was unable to get a job and pay her rent, and most of my siblings treated me like dirt acting grossed out just from seeing me, and some of them even used to tell me that: I should kill myself because no one would miss me anyway"".the only people in my family I am close with are my two little sisters and my older brother though he cut everyone in our family off including me because his wife does not like any of us which hit me hard.my family has pretty much fallen apart a surprise to anyone reading this I am sure haha.so that brings us to today I am 23 years old have no education, do not have any friends, I cannot get a job, and I Might be homeless soon.I am seeing a psychologist soon. I do not think it will help me much honestly. I wake up every day scared of being homeless I cannot relax anymore, I do not enjoy anything in life anymore. for anyone who is worried I do not think I am suicidal, but I am honestly finding it hard to find a reason to live anymore.to anyone who made it to the end of this probably very badly spelled post, Thank you. I feel like I am floating through life, and I do not know what to do anymore.",Depression
8878,"So much shame inside my head. I was raised in a Christian household, I was raised with proper, well adjusted parents. No trauma, no abuse, no abandonment or lack. Up until high school I always had at least one best friend, literally I always had one person who would agree with me that I was their best friend. Wed play tag a recess or just walk around the playground and talk about random shit. I went to church every Sunday, went to the beach with family, got along great with my siblings, parents had no favorites and treated us all equally, I had a cat I adored though admittedly sometimes terrorized it, I had (have technically, still living in the same home) a huge backyard that I played in almost every day with my siblings, we had (again have technically) amazing neighborhood friends. I would wake up every day with legitimate joy and wonder, I was excited, even for school. I had the kind of childhood that probably makes most people on this sub seethe with envy. Those people would read my post with incredulity, how in the living fuck is this guy? Why does he belong here?? He could not possibly understand what we have been throughand I agree. I do not. I do not know what the fuck is wrong with me, yet somehow I am emotionally and psychologically stunted, I isolate myself from family, I lash out at others for the smallest things, I victimize myself quite a bit, I just have a genuine disdain for this life. I feel like I have so much to say and yet my brain is so foggy. Of course when I want to say something my brain locks up, but if I want to sleep and relax, suddenly World War III has erupted in my head. Not that anyone would pay attention anyway, I understand that I am just another faceless person on this sub, whining about the same shit over and over and over again, just like everybody else. I was never popular, never had much attention given to me outside of family (yeah I know I sound pretty spoiled, many people on this sub could not even get attention from their family). I guess my problem is that I am just soterribly average and normal in all kinds of ways, and very much not average in all the wrong ways, in very disgusting ways, if that makes any sense. I have all this disgusting and inhuman traits, and nothing good. I have nothing to offer, I just should not fucking be here. Why did the universe allow me to be conceptualized? Why did my biological parents, whoever they are (adopted), have to create me?? All I ever wanted to do was be a super empathetic, compassionate, loving, safe, kind, accepting, giving, and joyful person. I am none of those. I am quickly losing my ability to empathize with others because I hurt too much, I cannot extend compassionate or love because reality is too cold and harsh, I do not feel safe with myselfhow long until that happens with other people as well? I am not very kind, I am super grumpy and angry at life and everyone in it, I am becoming very unaccepting of others because I feel like the universe or god has rejected me, I am not joyful, that is just a big no, I cringe at happy and uppity people. The only silver lining here is that I am sort of giving, only because I hate myself so much that I want to serve others (albeit in small ways) and forget I exist, I want to be put last. At the same time though I hate that I am feeling so left outso I want to be heard and acknowledged, but I cannot get any acknowledgment or attention from who it matters most..I am a horrible person with sickening thoughts anyway, why should I get any sort of acknowledgment. I should not get to have friends, to have a girlfriend (have not had one ever lol), to have a family that cares about me, to have hopes or dreams, I am nothing, I am no one important or special. I am just a dirty rag, I am the one cracked egg, the defective product, I have no purpose or use other than to be thrown away and discarded. I am understanding this and accepting this more and moreHonestly I barely care at this point whether people care anymore. I do not carethats all that matters. I am trying to think of other things to say, but that is probably a sign that I should stop. I have said all I can say, I have said many things multiple times over. I am not unique, I am not special, I am not someone anyone wants to be friends with or someone to look up to, I have no special qualities, no good looks, no intelligence, no wit or ability to make others laugh, I do not make anyone feel special or noticed or important, I do not make anyone excited when I walk in the room, if anything I suck the life out of the room, everyone watches me from their peripheral view, analyzing me to see what I want or what I am going to do, eager to see me leave. I justdont get it. I serve zero purpose and have no function. When people on this sub or anywhere else try and give me to stay, what is the fucking reason? could not be because I will help humanity, could not be because I have some special to offer, could not be because I look good, or give people the giggles, or befriend others easily, or make people feel at ease and calm, important, heard, it could not be because of anything good is my damn point. What do you want me to just sit in the corner and merely exist for the sake of my family? What kind of fucking life is that? Clearly no one in this world needs me, so you cannot possibly imply that there is some greater goal for me to achieve, or people to meet, or grand adventure to go on. I cannot do fucking anything that this world needs me to do, I cannot be anything this worlds need me to be, so just let me fucking go. Unfortunately society will not help me in this endeavor, so I must undergo this task alone, via hanging of the self. It should be fun. I do not care about the pain or slow agony of suffocating anymore, if anything I look forward to it in a sick way. I know I do not matter and do not have any worth or use, so its for the best. I am a creepy weirdo anyway, so I am just imagining all the faces of the people who will feel at ease knowing there is one less potentially dangerous person in the world, and Ill be happy knowing I will not live long enough to be one of them. So thanks for everything I guess, reddit has been a huge life saveruntil it is not I guess lmao. But seriously you guys helped me get through a lot of shitty moments, helped me fall under the illusion that I was not alone and I actually had a tribe, like I had found my people. I know my people do not exist, or if they do they are incredibly fucked up and nasty, and I do not want any empathy or compassion from them, I do not want to be related to them in any way shape or form. So Ill choose to kill myself instead. I literally cannot wait. For those of you who are leaving with me, see you on the other side (if there actually is one). Hopefully its a much better place than this, and we can ride on the cloud tops laughing at all the suckers stuck down here thinking its worthwhile. that would be awesome haha. I am literally so excited",Suicidal
8889,"listen, i cannot forcefully stop you but i can explain my story.back when i was severely suicidal (on watch 24/7) you could not even TAKE UR EYES OFF OF ME. i was just so tempted to do it i just could not resist.i still have my battle scars to this day.before i was admitted to the mental facility, my brother told something to me that i will never forget to this day; ""i may sound like an idiot, but you do not want to go the easy way out, you got to go the hard way out."", life has its moments, that does not change ur value.we all go through tough time, my dudes, and we have all experienced the thoughts.but when you feel such, think about the people that love and care for you, without you, the world is hopeless, we all have no hope. what can we do without you? were nothing without you. you are the glue that is holding this failed 4th grade science project we call **life.****When we recognize that someone is having suicidal thoughts, and we reach out, we are instantly planting a seed of hope that they are not invisible, that they are not alone.** **-misty vaughan allen** advice for the suicidal or the thinkers",Suicidal
8894,"So, I tend to get depressive episodes on a fairly regular basis (when I am at optimal mental health I get mild to severe dips like a week before my cycle that then go away within a few days) but I have been having some longer than normal ones lately, and I have been stuck in that sinking black hole for about two full weeks now. Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends, and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend, who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others, so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family, but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety, I sometimes do not take jokes very well, especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members, they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or, in rare cases, until I start crying. A lot of times, their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of ""I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of."" and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love, as well as mental heath topics, when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental health-wise in like a year, and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger. Sorry for the long post. there is a lot going on in my head and my life that I need to parse through I guess. Been A Little Rough Lately",Depression
8895,"I have dealt with depression pretty much my whole life, I am 34 now. let us get some basics out of the way: single, manager at an office for a bank, short enough to be self conscious about it, and just getting sober from weed.I am trying to clean the house because mom is visiting soon, but damn, I can barely do anything because nothing at this moment seems worth it. that is a familiar feeling, but it is hitting hard. I know I will work tomorrow, but when I am done... maybe exercise (that is not a big deal to me, it is more of a habit now anyways), but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life, which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here, but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again, but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself (thank you green for helping, I admit that), but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before, and even then I was getting brain shocks from that, but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault, but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals. Now I am back to scratching that spot on my head, dreading tomorrow.it is not like I am stupid... in some sense. Got the degree (yup, psych), dropped out of grad school, got a real estate license and personal training cert basically on a whim (both expired because I hate the selling). So I start and give up rather easily. My dream is to become an author. I know, overdone, but I cannot help it, I enjoy making a world and spooky stories and that is what makes it a dream, to at least live off that. Whenever I get someone to read something, I feel like I am forcing them to give me compliments, so now I have not touched my laptop (except for paying bills) in almost a year. I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone, constantly beating myself up, and knowing that tomorrow, I will not be able to improve. I would appreciate some input, or something nice? Ha. I am sure if you are reading this, you have an idea of why I am writing this. But it is not healthy. I take 20mg fluoxetine, but I cannot feel it. When I went up 40mg I felt terrible, so that is was not good. Anyways, thank you for letting me get this out.

I do not like getting out anymore because I now spend my time looking at people and wondering why I do not come out as normal when I do the same as them and the paranoia of them looking at me makes me want to be angered to the point of a migraine. Have been treating people I do not know with hostel words and actions because I believe I am more physically capable to hurt them or that the consequences are not enough for me to care. Have acted in blatant predatory and manipulative behavior. we are I fallow people in public from inside stores to parks to their cars I do not even know why.

I then spent the next two hours going to his bothers car, Walmart to get a bat, and followed him home. I parked a block away and walked by the trees with the bat at hand. He then got out so walked after got close enough that I whistled and busted his knee and ankle and ran like hell. The only problem is that I like to much. Been so used to my mother and others telling me what to do that I struggle to get things done to the point where I keep making my personality up as I go to make myself normal since I was told by my teachers and parent. Always hated everyone else since I was a kid only having friends knowing that if I do not I would have either kind myself or someone else out of the hated I get, filling myself with distractions to avoid myself.

It was all worthless since the day that I came to this hell they call Earth. Nobody can save me because I am impossible to save. do not even bother saying that is its all going to get better. The void inside that I have does not get filled, but gets even bigger everyday that I wake up to this fucking pain. I went through so many suicide attempts and I think I do not regret every single one. I do not want to know about what is going happen next with my goddamn life. Every fucking voice in my head is always telling me to die a fast death. I think I have reached the point where there is nothing else to discover. I said I was going to kill myself pretty soon so I think this the way my life is going to end. Thanks for 18 miserable fucking years. I think I fucking had it with all the bullshit.

8903,"Fake it till you make it One thing I have heard so often growing up. So much so I have almost mastered it.I have realized however this is wrong. I am now unable to handle basic life shit. I cannot be real. I cannot be dedicated. I cannot be anything other than what others want and now cannot be what I need. I have lost those whom care. I am struggling to keep my job. Though doubt is more common than sense at this point. Idk why I have not been fired. Assume my personality is making an image of me that is false and fake. If you do not know me I am amazing it seems. Actually know me and I am the worst person to know. Anyone and everyone. I tried to self access my self, even when every port into psychology has been closed for me (so I am no expert) but it seems its either my fault or my raising of understanding. I guess both can be my fault at the end of the day. Idk. My mother has issues for life, meaning I have observed, dealt with, or noticed. Father absent.

8908,"I have never been depressed really, I have always lived my life carefree without much thought. But for the past year I have gotten thoughts of suicide. Mainly because my life is so fucking bland and boring. The most exiting thing that happens in my life is playing video games, my life is really dumb tbh. If I was not a minor I would have already killed myself, because I want to shoot myself rather then hanging or any other method (The quickest way.) Plus I do not have any thing to hang myself with. So I most likely will not kill myself until I can get a gun (Probably 18.) Has anyone else felt like there life does not mean munch like this? When I think about my future I know I will just work some crappy job because I cannot go to college. Thinking about what my future holds is what really makes me want to kill myself. This compared to the other stories on here might sound dumb but idk, if I had a gun I would already be dead tbh. there is more then this but it is pretty boring and I'mm kind of lazy so eh I just do not know anymore",Suicidal

And when talking about my interests no one cares and just talks about what they do and never ask what other things I like doing or if there is other things I do other than what I post on the internet. People around me do not even acknowledge me that much I til I mention I am upset. If they cared then they would not have to come in repair mode every fucking goddamn time. Instead I am stuck besides myself and my hobbies and I do not even really like the things I like anymore that much, so my mind wanders off to suicidal thoughts and wondering how life would be better without me at all in the picture. not even my boyfriend seems to acknowledge the pain I feel half of the time, and he knows I would drop anything I am doing and do anything for him. Like whatever I guess, I cannot talk about my pain without them adding it on with their own damn pain in the mix. Overall most of the time now I am a very nasty and overall more easily irritable now.

Its mainly just dishes not being put up from the dishwasher the laundry is not done the beds are not made up, etc.I used to be taking showers every day right now its almost every other day again or just days with my boyfriend and I hang out or he comes over here. I ran a full tub of water for a bath and I almost got in but at the last minute I decided to put clothes back on and just go in bed and drain the tub out and we have a huge tub because its in the master bedroom and it was a waste of water and it makes me feel bad.I have not really gone out and done anything recently. I went shopping a while ago with my boyfriend and then within these past few days we went to the gym one time but I only walked on the treadmill for about less than a mile and I did some weights it was a lot less than I used to do. Then later that night he picked me up again and we got gas in town and I did not even get to get dressed I just left with what I had on which ones just a shirt, Nike shorts, and slip on shoes not even a bra even though I always put them on.I have not really been eating when I normally should I would eat a long time after I woke up and then not again until around midnight. I have been sleeping a lot mostly in an accident and its to the point where my boyfriend has been saying are you sure you are not having narcolepsy but I know I do not its just tiredness.My boyfriend and I have plans to go out next Friday and I am having a hard time getting motivated for that even though it will seem like a fun time and we also have to move in together at the same day same time and were planning to stay the night and burn around the city for two days to get used to it and I am having a hard time getting motivated for her to even though it sounds like fun with him.I am going to college in less than a month and I already made a post about how I feel like I do not fit in and the comments are really kind and considerate really make me feel any different besides a tad bit I am glad other people feel the same as me somewhat.

For a little perspective on myself I am 24 years old and have been depressed since I was 13-14. My depression has gotten bad to the point where the things I use to love such as playing music, writing movie scripts, and reading books are no longer an enjoyment of mine but instead a nuisance/annoyance. Last year I was rejected from film school, all my friends are either engaged, have good jobs or both. The one women that I have loved, who I still consider a friend,is now engaged to her fianc who is significantly better looking and more charming than myself. I on the other hand am still sleeping on my dads couch watching Simpsons re-runs day in and day out. I live in a world where everyone around me is happy while I continue to be miserable. I see no better option to eventually kill myself at some point down the road. Id tried therapy but that has not worked, I search inside of myself to find a reason and always come up empty. I have a worthless degree, a job I hate and no one who would flinch if I died tomorrow. The only thing keeping me alive is my dad. that is it. Eventually I will die from a suicide.I have accomplished nothing in life. I am as close to 18 as I am to 30 and have nothing to show for it. I am alone.

I like art and music but I am painfully bad at both. I look forward to nothing. I am financially well off and feeling this way while being so privileged just makes me feel like such a waste of space. a waste of protons, brain waves, oxygen, food, water, money.

I have never wanted to marry someone and spend my life with someone before. and he hates me. he makes me hurt on purpose and yells at me to overwhelm me. he talks down to me and asks me why things are so hard for me to understand. but I am really starting to think its just my fault.

The only time that I started accepting myself was when I was in a relationship and had someone there to remind me that at least they thought I was attractive, and that was all that mattered. However, my insecurities eventually got the best of me and I became toxic and jealous, which led to the end of the relationship several months ago.I deserved that, and she deserved better. I know that I hurt her a lot, and I have trouble living with that. It also reduces my self image further, to where I have trouble living with myself in general. I think I was incredibly lucky to have been in a relationship with someone like that, and I do not think it will happen again. I do not want it to happen again, because I know it would end the same way. I have been in therapy and help groups since the break up trying to deal with myself and be a better person, but I have not noticed any improvement.I think at this point I am just a burden and holding the people around me back. I am always bringing up my issues and wanting to deal with them, but it is just at a point now where no one wants to see me anymore because of that.

You should be grateful for all the things you have.""My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own.

8940,"Hi, I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post, so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete, my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected, and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to, all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless, pathetic loser. I just want to die, but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it, so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up.

8942,"Hello. I have read alot of people on here(suicide and depression groups) who actually encourage suicide and that is never okay. I am not wanting people who can relate to these feelings but rather hoping someone who is online is an advocate or something who can give me hope. I am in a very bad/dark mindset and I am contemplating suicide. I have been for over a month but tonight I am truly having the mindset to go forth. I have a legit(to **ME**) reason as to why I am contemplating. I do not want to go into details on here as I got hate earlier for reaching out with my reasoning. I was told I was pathetic and ridiculous for wanting to end my life over said reason and was told to get over it and move on when I strictly asked for that not to do be mentioned.The suicide hotline is not cutting it... it makes me uncomfortable. I want to be able to talk about my issues but I cannot as I have no one. The one person I did have.... is gone and now I am like this... Alone and contemplating ending it all.(get help seek a doctor seek meds move on get over it quit relying on someone else for happiness time heals etc) are all things I do not need to hear. They make matters worse. they are cliche and there is a reason why therapists avoid using those.One, I am seeking help on here. Two, I reached out to a new therapist. Three, I do not like meds. Four, I cannot move on or get over my situation. Five, I do not rely on someone else for happiness they just so happened to be the only shred of happiness I had in life. Six, time does not heal. Sometimes time will because things to fade to a certain extent... but it is not that way for EVERYONE. If time healed and people got over everything(cliche) this group would not exist. Suicide would not exist. So to be as short as I can. I am going through the biggest/worst event of my life. I am alone. I am sad. I am heartbroken. I have no one and I mean that. Family told me to ""either kill yourself or shut the hell up I am tired of hearing crying and about you being sad."" I do not get out of my house much. I am an introvert with super bad IBS who is scared of everything... literally. So no I do not have any friends. I *had* one true person in life. Anyways, I have gone through death. Watched some of the closest people to me die awful death's. The worst being a death brought on by cancer. Watched her deteriorate after the diagnosis-radiation and chemo, and within a year of diagnosis she died in hospice. Last moments with her she was not there. She was so doped up on pain meds she could not talk and did not know who we were. And STILL this pain I am facing now as awful as that sounds.... does not even begin to amount to this pain I am feeling now. I am wanting to end my life. I can end my life so easily right now but a small piece of me wants to hang on or I would not be on here. Sure it is sad and pathetic I am on here for help but it is HERE FOR A REASON because some people still care about others in life even if it is strangers. Is there a safe video chat or some kind of chat(not suicide hotline-convos too short) that does not have a time limit? If not, I just need hope. I need to hear that there is always hope. I know you do not know what my situation is or why I am asking for hope, but if it is true, my situation does not matter. There IS hope. I need just a small amount. Just a tad so I can NOT go over the edge. I want to talk about why I am feeling this way SO BAD but I know I will get hate... even if it is one person out of 10 or so. Someone is going to give me hate and make me feel more like shit or they are going to say the one thing's I have said I cannot bare to hear anymore. Please... anyone? Hope. I am alone and broken...

8943,"So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty",Depression
8945,"It makes me laugh, in a half-shocked-half-depressed kind of way, that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved, it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful: work, relationships, nature, but above all, meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head, disturbed, mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then, is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so, how sick is it to try to change the mind itself, to try to convince it that no, pain is actually fine, there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way, that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day, collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside, into nature, to find friends and do real, meaningful activities with them, to get away from all the stress, anger, and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life, with meaningful work, meaningful goals, meaningful friendships, but above all, a way to find meaning in every action, to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better.

Recently I think I am just sick of being sad and low , I want to feel happy again .I have an appointment lined up with a psychologist in September .As i sit here , sleepless and restless like every other night for the past 6 years I cannot wait for that day . Finding an answer to my lifes burden will be the happiest day of my life . Having a diagnosis will also allow me to treat my symptoms too . I look forward to it . I cannot wait to be confident I cannot wait to be understood I cannot wait to be able to sleep I cannot wait to be happy I cannot wait to love againI cannot wait to be able to raise the bar of my moodIt is very late here so apologies for my rambling , I have always wanted to tell somebody how much I look forward to finally getting an official diagnosis and cure to this misery .

8956,"I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes and other errors i will probably make.Well the post title is just that, living is fun and all sometimes but i just cannot handle it anymore. No matter what i try, i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore, i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father, the occasional kick or punch i can deal with, but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house, Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it, eating it, or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am, how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why, but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah, she was a friend of my GF and me at the time, and when shit hit the fan she was there for me, i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me, i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a job""It would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself"" That still sticks with me today, i think about it every single time i get closer to someone, every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right, that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh, maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it, or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point, when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing, then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong, and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone, if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks, when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore, every single day seems to get worse and worse. And there is nothing i can do about it.I am sorry if you read this, you should not have but i just needed somewhere to write this downI just do not want all this fucking baggage Sometimes i just do not want to live anymore, or atleast not as myself.",Depression
8959,"I was given emergency surgery to repair testicular torsion back in 2017 and to this day I believe the surgery was botched in some way. I get frequent spells of extreme testicular pain that resonates throughout my lower abdomen. Not a minor annoyance either, pain so bad I sometimes have to go to the ER because I have reason to believe it is another torsion. Tonight makes the fifth trip to the ER with nothing wrong and no treatment given, along with several urologists throughout the years. Now, I am trans and am interested in an orchiectomy for both medical reasons and dysphoria. However, I still do not know *for sure* if my testicles are the issue. I have seen several hypotheses given through the years, ranging from bladder infections to just really, really bad cases of ""blue balls."" If my orchiectomy happens (my consultation is in early-August) and this mysterious chronic pain persists, I have no choice but to eat buckshot. I cannot take it anymore and this surgery is my last hope. These periods of intense pain have cost me a job, they have cost me social opportunities, and they have cost my family a fortune in American medical bills. Because of this, I feel horrifically guilty for constantly needing to go to the ER and having no diagnosis or treatment to show for it. While they are very understanding and thoroughly supportive, I cannot shake the intrusive thought that they are annoyed and think I am just being a hypochondriac.As I write this, I am stoned off my ass. I use cannabis to cope because I do not know what else to do. I am not enjoying this high right now either, because I am still in a fair amount of pain. The ER sometimes sends me home with prescriptions for opiates, but I have seen what those do to people and refuse to let myself use them, because I know I will become physically, and eventually psychologically, addicted to them. I do not use alcohol to cope either because it is also incredibly dangerous to rely on for chronic pain relief. I am 100% banking on this surgery. If this inexplicable pain returns post-recovery, I am not sure I will be able to take it any longer. If I were a cis man, I would have probably killed myself after three years of this. My orchiectomy is my last chance to live a pain-free life.",Suicidal
8960,"I was heavily considering killing myself in December 2019, and honestly, the idea was never completely out of my head prior to that either. I wish I did. I wish every single day that I did.Things were finally getting better and I had just received a handful of amazing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities the week before the pandemic officially started a you.S. lockdown. I had one week. Just one week that I did not think about dying every single morning and every single night.Everything has been hell. I lost my apartment and had to move home because the person I moved in with went absolutely insane and had a total breakdown and started aggressively forcing me to live by her conspiracy theory rules. (Covid is spread via the sidewalk, covid is spread via open windows in the air two stories up, the windows needed to be boarded up, never once leaving the apartment in a year, etc.)Covid is a completely different experience for those who have significant others and a stable living situation. I had neither. I tried so hard to go on dating sites so I would not be completely alone. But people would lovebomb me and then when I was invested they would start being abusive and degrading and cruel. I gave up.It feels like women genuinely do not care about anything other than their boyfriends no matter how progressive or new age they are. All of my female friends revolved their entire lives around their boyfriends since the pandemic started, and honestly before that too.I hate being home. I despise it. But I social distanced as much as possible. I was guilted or shamed by people for going out, and guilted and shamed by people for staying in. It felt like all my female friends would always justify that they constantly visited their boyfriends, or spent all their time with their boyfriends. But if I ever saw a friend once a month, it was frowned upon.Why? Why is it so taboo and wrong for me to be social just because it was not with someone who I was fucking.My friends all made me realize that it is impossible to ever get structure unless I somehow manage to find a significant other. But I have tried so hard to date and almost every time has been a traumatic experience.I am so jealous of them. I hate them. I do not want to hate my friends. But I feel so angry. I feel so misunderstood. Absolutely NONE of the people who judged me would ever go through what I went through.I moved back home with my parents from a huge city to a town with 800 people. My parents, I love very much but they are both abusive. I did not have a choice. I had to leave my apartment because my roommate had stopped working and paying rent. I would have had to pay the entire 2 bedroom rent if I stayed.I feel like a burden. I wish I had just died. there is no place for me in this world. I have not been happy in two years. I lost everything. I will never have a life that is rewarded in a pandemic. I am not meant to be happy &amp;#x200B;&amp;#x200B;I will only ever destroy my life and I do not deserve happiness I wish I killed myself before the pandemic",Suicidal

I have manic bipolar and I have come to know the signs of when I am going to become manic and this is always the fist step and I am scared. I know its hard to believe and you might not believe me and just think I am doing this for attention but I do not know who to go to. We see the same therapist and I cannot talk to her because I do not want her to think I am not a good dad. I do not have freinds because I have a full time job and I am a full time father.

8972,"I do not know anymore. I just cannot feel happy or anything good, I am always sad and I am constantly telling myself that I *should* be happy. I am doing the things that used to make me happy, but I just feel empty. And then this compared to some of the shit my friends go through, like my friend who is dad started another family whilst still being married to his mom, and he can persist, I, on the other hand, cannot persist after anything negative. And by anything negative it could literally be me listening to some of the music I like (a band I enjoy listening to has some very odd music and if I am feeling some way I can be sent into an episode of sort, ending in me either hurting myself or crying for hours on end, or having to lean on somebody, and that option has been completely scratched off so its only two ig). I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for quite some time, I just do not see the need to keep pointlessly wade through pain for a mediocre at best experience. I probably hurt myself maybe once or twice a month, usually just like cutting myself on the thigh. I honestly do not think Id be missed when/if I go. My parents want absolutely nothing to do with me, probably because I am a dead beat who cannot get shit done, and when it comes to graded I am like a B student. And then I have like two actual friends, one of which I can barely talk to because her parents strongly dislike me because I would always have to lean on her for support, and she was the only person who could help me while being willing to help me. But apparently I was putting too much pressure on her so I am only allowed to talk to her whenever her parents are around. And my other friend just does not understand what I go through. Anyways I am sorry for whoever read that and idk i do not think I am in direct threat to a suicide (I might like cut myself later though) and I am sorry for wasting your guys time. I just want help and I am sorry because Ill be no help to anyone trying to help me because I do not even know what is wrong, ig it comes back to probably my favorite lyric someone help me understand what is going on inside my mind.

8998,Every second of the day I am on the edge of having a panic attack (I had my first last year in November) it felt like I was going crazy and words did not make sense I felt this fear over come my body I felt as if I was seeing the world through a phone and I did not feel present if that makes sense. I suffer with really bad social anxiety but during my panic attack I wanted to run up to random people and ask this if everything was going to be okay and to make sure I was fine. I got lightheaded because of the terror in my body and my hands and legs were going cold and numb. I seriously wanted to die during it all it lasted about 20 minutes and then calmed down a bit to where I could at least keep myself fighting to want to live. I have not had a full blown panic attack like that again but ever since I know the feeling I have this fear of having it again and will get random waves of that anxiety I had before I had my panic attack which just makes me freak out more. I do not want to self diagnose so I am just going to say I have this intrusive thoughts that I am becoming schizophrenic 24/7 so the most random things will trigger me that never did before and I obsess over it 1000 times after that questioning why it did and come to the conclusion I am losing it. If I hear a song on the radio and the voice is kind of weird or the beat is somewhat scary I imagine scary things and my brain will start glitching out but I think it is because of the fear in my head and I am just fabricating my fears.

""I am like but you blastin music."" he is all ""You irritating more ppl than me, now I turned it down, now put yours out."" I am like ""No"" Then he snitches to bus driver and I call him a snicth. Then he is all the like ""your Mama's a snitch"" meanwhile I put it out and he turns back up the gangsta rap and starts rapping obnoxiously. Then bus driver starts threatening to kick me off and bout a fucking mask. So I put on a scarf. We eventually all get kicked off for me smoking and the gangsta rap. Moral is everyone want listen to gangsta rap but nobody can do gangsta shit. they talk the talk but cannot walk the walk. Nobody can handle the reality of it. Everytime somebody does she me gangsta shit someone winds up snitching, wining or going against it. Everyone claims to be from the hood, wears gangsta clothing: baggy pants,Jordans cortezes, white tee and gold teeth but nobody can handle the lifestyle.

9014,"So, I am a few months shy of 21, I have been struggling with depression since I was 14 and, right now, my life has gone through some drastic changes that have affected my mental health. I dropped out of college to pursue a career in medicine (I used to be a nursing student, now I am seeking medical school) and that, associated with quarantine, made me spend a lot of time home.Because of this, I have been dealing with constant homophobia by my family, especially my father and brother and more unrequested comments about everything I do. This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations.

9026,"Honestly, not even sure what I want to say. Kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. Not post-partum depression. I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead.

But now I think that was a mistake. We were really close before, her kids adore me and her husband got along with me. But over time, I have damaged a lot of that relationship because of my mental illnesses and I think she resents me, possibly hates me and the only reason she let me stay here was because her kids like me and she feels guilty because of how much I have helped them monetarily over the past couple of years, even though I have never asked for a dime back and do not care about the money. But everything since I began moving in last week, up through now says she does not want me here, and now I cannot afford to move anywhere else.

9044,"really wish i could talk to someone but my best friend is the reason I am so sad. i got my life fucked and flipped over 5 years ago and I have just been picking up pieces ever since. I am in therapy three times a week I am on drugs that are meant for war veterans and every meaningful person in my life i have effectively pushed them away. no good excuse besides being ruled by trauma and not being able to cope effectively. i see my last lifeline just kind of living and having a good time and being present and I am so jealous its hard to talk to her at all. I am so behind I am never going to make it to where everyone else is. I have attempted twice and idk why i have to be alive. why do i have to be here. i just try to make it through every day i do not have purpose. i can hardly feed myself. everyone else is making strides in their lives and moving to new cities and jobs and everything. I have been stagnant for 5 years. I am 23. my life got fucked at 18 and I am mentally still fucking there. because i cannot get away from my thoughts man. 6 mental diagnosis later and i just cannot do this shit anymore. I am tired of seeing people have all of the things i so desperately want. it comes to everyone else so fucking easily. i get how people say ""no do not die you have sm to live for you are so young"" ya ok that does not apply to me. i do not have so much to live for. i have no desire to continue because i am never going to fucking catch up. i do not want the life i live. i do not want the things that have happened in my life. i did not ask to fucking be here. i just take up resources that could be better used with people who have lives worth living or at least passion and drive. the only future i see for myself is in the fucking ground within the next few months. the life expectancy for my illnesses is 39-42 anyways. oh by suicide if you were curious.

They still talk about how much they hate me and how much happier they are without me on social media, and it hurts me so much. It hurts just as much as the day it happened, and I do not know who I am or what value I have without them.Every day is a struggle to get through, and I feel like I cannot keep living like this; always suicidal and thinking about how the only people who is opinions I cared about do not care if I live or die.I have nightmares regularly of them all in front of me telling me how horrible I am.

9060,"Just to clarify, **I have never told anyone that I have wanted to die because of them, and I will never do something that in my life.**But... What I have done, having realized that yesterday, is something **very** selfish...In the past years, I used to tell some of the closest friends I have ever had about my feelings of suicide, like I felt sad, empty or than I wanted to catch the bus, including a time I engaged into self-harm once or twice, **(but I never told them it was because of them or something similar).** I also told the same things to people I used to know from the internet...What I did... Is **unforgivable.**I put such a huge **burden on them**, I think I made them feel they were responsible for my happiness... Even if that was not my intention, even if I tried to reciprocate things to them as much as I could; the **damage** was done.Those things should only be told either to qualified mental health professionals with decades of study, or in anonymous forums with people who have similar problems, but either the anonymity or professional relationship have boundaries to ensure the person who listens will not end up feeling guilty or responsible.Maybe that is the main reason I ended up being mostly alone... Even if I was desperate for help, I asked for it in the most horrible way I could have ever done...They moved on because they deserved to be happy, they deserved to be surrounded with positive people who love them, they deserved all the good things in the world...Something that a useless, toxic and cowardly person like me would never be able to provide... Even if I was hurt a lot, even if society ended up betraying me, I should have never asked that kind of advice to them... Honestly... I do not think I have ever been a good person at all... Ever since I was a child I have had trouble connecting with people, my way of being (like how I speak, walk and express myself), pissed them off so much that they ended up bullying me as punishment, or they slowly ignored me until I got the message and moved away from their lives.Heh, and I thought I could be a hero... What kind of hero does that?What kind of **decent** human being does something like that?Like someone told me once, even if I never had bad intentions towards them, my **final actions** were the ones that mattered the most.Aristotle said that there are friendships based either on affinity, utility and true love...Aside from some exceptions, I think most of the friendships I have ever had in my life were about utility and affinity, with very few ones based on true love...And if deep inside my core I am not a good person, it explains why I have to suffer like this as punishment. I think I have been a manipulator...",Suicidal
9061,"Hi guys I am a 18F and I feel like I am falling back into a state of depression. I feel like part of it is because it is summer break so I feel like I have nothing productive to do. Throughout the day I am just in a constant state of sadness although idk if it would be considered depression. I sometimes find myself thinking about death even though I am not necessarily suicidal. I do not really have the motivation to do anything productive and just laze around all day until its night time when I usually play games with my friends. This gives me some joy but then after it is done I fall back into that sad state. I feel like I have no one to talk to because I feel like I do not deserve to be depressed or sad. I do not have any financial struggles and I have a pretty good relationship with family and friends.

9062,"Below me the oceans waves crashed into the rocks. The ocean stretched out as far as the eyes could see, the artwork of God that makes real life seem like a dream.It was almost 6pm, the sun was setting and it painted a beautiful shade of orange on the oceans surface. A sunset is one of the most beautiful sights you could ever witness. However, the sun setting above the ocean its beauty can barely be described. I was standing on a cliff above the ocean, about 10 feet from the edge. My mind and body was sending waves of warnings about the dangers that awaited if I went any closer. Danger ahead it whispered, your safer here. The human brain has an unprecedented instinct for survival. I took a few steps forward and the warnings multiplied. Stop fucking walking the voice screamed. I was three feet closer to the edge of the cliff now and I could truly see the whole ocean ahead of me. I took sometime to bask in its beauty. I was standing still so the voice dwindled but still conspicuously whispered go fucking back.I involuntarily began reminiscing on the tragedy that is my past. The pain and agony inflicted on me by the world, the hell I went through in the hands of others, the betrayals from those I trusted, my regrets, the ones I have lost, the embarrassments, and humiliations I endured and most especially the catastrophes I personally inflicted upon myself and those I love due to my slavery to my desires and greed.The rest, I could find ways to cope with because the malevolence of the world and the human-beings that run it is not obscure, except to the hopelessly naive (which I was a part of for the longest time). I found it most onerous however to handle the last one for one simple reason; its one thing to be going through rejection, torment and suffering and its another thing to go through these things with the irrefutable knowledge that you are responsible for majority, if not all of it. Agony that is your fault is a special type of pain.I took more steps forward and my brain fired into overdrive survival mode. It was shrieking at me at this point. Its words incoherent but its meaning crystal clear.Death is close.Shockwaves of fear and terror flowed through me from head to toe and all I could perceive was the 50 feet drop into a belligerent ocean that crashed steadfastly into a bunch of jagged rocks, its thunderous boom promised to pull me into the everlasting warmth of oblivion if I fell, where my body would probably never be found.I was at the edge of the cliff now and my whole life had flashed through my eyes. Then I heard those words. I am seeing someoneThe phrase that drove me over the deep edge. The phrase that represented the coalescence of all my ignorant, vacuous, naive, selfish, greedy and gullible decisions.I still remember exactly how those words made me feel.Standing on the edge of the cliff with every molecule of my body screaming for me to turn back, I realized an important, simple fact.The pain and tragedy of my past and present just has to feel more overwhelming than my fear of demise to make turning back to my reality feel more painful than taking one more step. Standing on the edge of this cliff I deeply understood this feeling. I am in so much pain, I feel so alone all the time even when I am around those who love me so dearly. I do not understand how to make things better. I do not know if things will ever get better. So far its gone from bad to worse to agonizing and I do not know how to bear these feelings anymore. Nothing indicates that things will get better. Signs keep pointing to things getting worse. I feel so tired of being me and it feels easier to just take one more step.I turned back and walked away, for my family, who have loved me far more than I have ever loved myself. I know a lot of us on here are struggling. I wrote a short prose, I hope it gives someone solace.",Suicidal
9063,"sorry I am really close to just giving up everything.. all of the abuse I have endured this far makes me constantly wonder if i deserved it. I have always been a caring person and I have always been as nice as i can be but the world just constantly throws it back in my face. growing up with r\*pe, sexual and emotional abuse for years from my stepfather (and physical abuse from his romantic interests) alongside the murder? suicide? of my mom, i do not even know anymore what happened to herand that is hurting too. I am tired. i do not know if ""things will get better"" is true at all. I am 22 now and nothing has gotten better. all of the family that might have cared for me are dead now or i just do not talk to them because they have all of their own problems, not like a lot of them had ever gone through the effort to talk or help me anyways. its always been me, until foster care stepped in. cannot even mention the shittiness of that. my only escape used to be the internet, but at this point its less of an escape and just too much for me now toothere are little things in life i love, like my pets and my fiance and my friends, but i do not think i can make it any further in life. i do not want to drag them down with me while I am running out of money and literally deterriorating in front of my fiance, though i know I have already impacted his health. does not matter how much i try my best to be the best for him, I am just not good. the only ways i can function even just slightly is if I am high on anything. I have tried hard not to get into alcohol or do anything that might harm my body but i already have it pretty bad there anyways so i do not even know if its worth tryign to preserve myself at all. all i ever got told growing up from people who cared is that I am strong for living through what i did but it is too hard to get over those things when they impede my daily living constantly. i cannot go outside or i have terrible anxiety attacks, cannot work for the same reason. i can hardly buy groceries without either being in too much pain or suffering from these anxiety issues. needless to say the ptsd and insomnia make sleep almost impssible to come by and not at all refreshing. even just writing this reminds me that i just have too many problems and not a single solution for them has worked and I am tired of trying to fix things, using energy i do not have to do these things and try to live i just want to sleep and never wake up or maybe ill go on a walk and get hit by a car and die or something with my luck.

As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression

Mom died young, after I graduated, and it messed me up, Dad developed Dementia and I was essentially forced to take care of him with little support until I finally broke down and he had to go to a nursing home. Pretty isolated from the rest of the family with few remaining friends.

What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia.

At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live. Either way, I am physically not in shape and have a particularly bad spine (the wonderful aftermath of a fractured vertebra that had to heal on its own...), yet most jobs about nature require to be in pretty good shape.I have seen young adults, usually friends, buy a farm and work together. It would be amazing for me to have this opportunity. But I know no one, I have no training in farm jobs and then again I am physically in not so great shape.This autumn will be my third attempt at completing the first year of Northern studies. I have been trying to complete it ever since 2018 and in 2020-2021 I did nothing of my life. I feel horrible. How am I supposed to get by in life as an adult if I cannot even complete a University year in a study field that I adore?I am such an inconvenience and a disappointment. I feel so sorry for my parents. My life seems doomed to failure.My apologies for the long rant. My life is doomed to failure.",Suicidal

9094,"So far I have a referral pending to an outpatient program where I can hopefully get my diagnosis reevaluated. I was originally diagnosed with depression two years ago but that is when I was in a major depressive episode I was depressed for around two years. Now I am realizing that all my life I have been having severe mood swings and sometimes that is what causes me to attempt. I am getting serious about the outpatient program this time and I am making sure to keep a log of all my mood swings and symptoms for an accurate diagnosis. But now, what can I do in the meantime for self care?**here is the story: \[ TRIGGER WARNING \]**Last Thursday I started drinking alcohol around midnight, then woke up in a dissociative state (completely sober) and attempted to hang myself. I tried once and failed, then I cleaned my room for hours before trying again. I called a crisis line and they called me an ambulance.Still in the dissociative state I walked out of the hospital in the gown and no shoes, I got about half way home before someone called the cops on me. I was so detached that I could not feel the pain in my feet. But when I got back to the hospital I realized that my feet were swollen to the size of a melon and I had blood blisters so large I could hardly walk.I have dissociated before but this time it was severe. It looked like in the movies when you see out of a characters eyes (or POV footage) and even now thinking back on it, it does not feel like it was me who walked out of the hospital.I lied and said that I was still drunk when I walked out, and the psychiatrist on duty gave me the option to be admitted or to go home. I chose to go home, and now I am feeling lost, ashamed and embarrassed about what happened. I survived an attempt and was picked up by the cops after walking out of the hospital where do I go from here?",Suicidal

I feel like I did not achieve anything great in my life except attending a good university and being part of an association but I am not brilliant in my studies neither in my relationships. I was a cool guy when I was like 15 but then I changed and I became more and more an introvert and I feel like my parents are the ones to blame although I love them but I have a thought that everyone in this world is the mirror of his parents.So mine are conservative especially my mom she yells a lot she is very stubborn she is the one who decides in everything and that makes me sick my father is the nicest person that I know but he is also so dumb and irresponsible he always says yes to my mom and I feel like he is not like the other fathers like dominant respected fathers he does not have to be tough but at least he got respected from his family and friends which btw he has none maybe few and tbh I feel sorry for him and I am afraid that one day I will become like him that is my biggest fear. I always needed my parents to advice me to support me when I was depressed but they never did and once I told my mom that I really need a therapist she refused to let me go and see one . And for the last years I really needed to see a therapist until now but she never allowed me to do such things she thinks that doctors are thiefs and they are not able to make someone feel better and by time you will be a better person but It just get worse and worse I know you are going to say that I am mean to my parents but that is how I feel about them.

9101,"I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go. It almost feels like all those things are happening and that I am being left behind to build my own new path brick by brick, and I am all out if bricks. My head feels like a dull, dense boring grey rock with nothing going in or out and nothing ever changing.

They only keep getting worse.As a little girl growing up, I thought I could be happy even if I was not pretty. I wanted to know that the TV shows and movies did not lie to me, and that I would have boyfriends, and go to parties, and get fucked at prom. I wanted to know I would get married one day, and have babies. I just wanted to be normal. But I learned very early, very quickly that I would never have those experiences. I got told my ears and eyes were too big. I was told ""dresses are for pretty girls, you can wear shorts."" l got told no one would ever want to date me, but at least I was skinny. I got told I should probably just kill herself because unattractive people do not end up happy. I was not even 10 yet, just that little girl. Then that little girl started to grow up. And everything they said was true. No one wanted to date me. No one wanted to talk to me. No one wanted to fuck me. I was ignored. Completely invisible. I did not get asked to dances. I did not get asked to prom. I had to go to war with a teacher who tried to fail me for no other reason accept the one he finally admitted to, ""I just do not like the way you look."" I am just not pretty. I know that. People made that very clear. Since I was not pretty, I had to become smart. I had no choice. The only problem with that was I was smart enough to realize how miserable I was. How much pain I was in with nowhere to put it. She was smart enough to go to college. Where everyone gets porked and finds their partner right? Wrong. That girl was told at the only party she was allowed into that she was too ugly to be raped. That girl was excluded from going to parties after that. People invited that girls' roommates to go out and do things RIGHT IN FRONT of her and excluded her. That girl was fired for being too ugly to work at the school. That girl was told she should just become a nun since she was never going to be able to find anyone to fuck her. That girl finally made her first attempt when she was 19. Which she failed, miserably. She tried again at 20. Again, another failure.That girl, now a woman, understands why men do not want her. she is understood her whole life and has been forced to just accept it. She understands that she will be alone for the rest of her life. She could shorten that life of course. She could make the pain stop. Would it be worth it? Just to make the memories stop? To not have to endure the future of more pain? What the hell...why not? New here and after reading some of your stories, I thought I would take a stab at telling a little bit of mine.

9115,"Never imagined posting something publicly on the internet. My depression started in my early childhood. In my family I was an unnecessary child. My twin sister always got the love from both of my parents. I swear my parents never even said ""I love you"" to me all I ever heard was ""why cannot you learn from your sister"". Even in their last day before they all died in a car crash while driving my sister to her dance lesson I remember my mothers last words were ""why do you keep wasting our time you will never achieve anything in your life"" when I accidently hit my sister with a ball while playing with our dog. After that I got adopted and my foster parents did not really care about me they just did that because they got paid for it. I was lucky to get to keep my dog because she was the only thing I had left. In school I never really had any friends I only had 1 sided friendships where I thought I had a friend but the other person did not think of me as his friend. I also got bullied in school for being adopted and being ugly. After 2 years of being adopted my dog started shaking weirdly and it was because of water in lungs some form of cancer or something I do not even know now but my foster parents took my dog away so she would not have to suffer from her incurable disease. I swear the day my dog died was the last time I had smiled in my life and it was 16 years ago. I work at a furniture factory because I was to depressed to keep studying. I worked hard everyday and then spent the rest of the day doing nothing. My apartment is always a mess because I never had a true friend that is why I never really worried about cleaning up. I always tried finding a friend during school years but I either got ignored or I became ""friends"" with people who just made me walk with them like a dog because they never talked to me and ignored my questions if I did not ask it like 10 times. People in work seem to avoid me as well but I am used to it since school years. I am now stuck in an endless cycle between work and home.The only thing I have ever wished in my life was to be loved atleast once by someone who understands me who would make me smile once more and would not ignore me like everyone else who think so fucking high of themselves.

You would put a coin in, and watch as it spirals down. It would go slowly at first, then pick up speed as the circumference becomes smaller and smaller, until an audible chink, and then silence. It reminds me of a black hole - a one way journey to the centre. Well I am somewhere on that spiral, maybe not at the bottom, but far from the top, and past the event horizon from where no matter returns. I guess in a sense we are all on that spiral, but I feel much further down than I should be at this point. As I sit at home on my computer, slowly deteriorating, having been to therapy twice and both times removed from the service for missing appointments, all that was interesting or exciting is blown away by the most gentle of winds, and all that remains is an empty she will of what once was. I am, by choice, disconnected from society, and I despise the human race and the brutal foundations it so delicately rests upon. I have problems with my stomach which mean I have such little energy that everything feels like a lot of effort, and I am in pain most days. The doctors cannot find anything wrong, and I have given up trying to find an answer or a cure. I loathe everything about myself, and by everything I really do mean e v e r y t h i n g! From the way I look, to the way I interact with people, to every nuance that defines who I am - an incomprehensible number of variables. As I do not like interacting with people anymore, and having largely withdrawn from society, I have also begun to neglect my hygiene and my health. Every day feels like groundhog day - waking up and maintaining myself for nothing, just to live another day in pain, a pointless expense of energy which I can no longer afford. Many days now I eat one meal per day, and struggle to find the energy or will to have a shower and take care of myself. I am beginning to be able to describe myself as Christian Bale from 'The Machinist', but less productive - at least Christian goes to work every day and forms some type of relationships. I eat when my stomach allows me to, I sleep when I pass out from tiredness, I wake when the birds become too loud to ignore, and I leave the house when absolutely necessary. I feel sorry for anyone that I befriend, as I know I will lose interest eventually, have an episode where I do not want to talk to anyone, and will inevitably just stop talking to them altogether, so I have stopped making new friends as it is not fair on them. I infrequently talk to the one or two I still have, and make excuses often for why ""I cannot talk today"". I struggle to make long term goals as I do not see myself being here long term. When I think into the future, I see a make-believe fantasy of what could never exist, nothing even remotely tangible given reality as it is precursor, and so I prolong my existence with video games and make-believe - a distraction, a way to delay the inevitable. But as soon as I exit the video game, the day dream, the false fantasy, and remove the veil of distraction, I am thrown back into and reminded of the world in which I am expected to be happy, in which I am expected to be grateful, a world that I am expected to enjoy, but do not.

Just nacho cheese sauce and oil. It was not bad, but it really made me feel incompetent. You know, I have been studying and studying on how to cook and season stuff properly and what seasons work well with others. Like for this, it was onion powder, chili powder, ground cumin and salt and pepper. could not taste any of it.For the refried beans, I also got some green chili sauce with lime, figuring it would really jazz up the flavors in the beef as you bit down. Topped with the rice, nacho cheese sauce, Colby cheese shredded, tomatoes and baby spinach on top to keep it away from the heat so it would not wilt and get that sort of really strong iron taste.I put a LOT of thought into this and it just ends up turning out meh.

In hindsight, I should have seen it coming from miles away but on the other hand, I wish it did not happen or atleast I would wish to be able to turn back time to prevent some things from happening. But we do not have such a thing, so my life is fucked either way.So, the first week of 2020 I gave up a deadbeat, no life job for something promising, something with a future. Raised out of a family where such a thing is an impossibility, I could have atleast try. Everything was fine, I loved the job, It was physical, it was a challenge, I felt... Happy. 3 months later, I find myself in hospital. I broke my ankle at my job. Again, in hindsight, my fucking mistake. I twisted my ankle at a location where it happened once shortly before, but a donkey does not hit the same rock twice in a row right? Right. I spend 2 months in a cast, longer than what was expected and another month out of the cast before I could even attempt going to work. That should have raised an alarm bell.

And such, I went to work; They gave me adjusted work, essentially I had to sit in an office like space, controling valves, pumps and monitors. But no matter what I did, how patient my boss was the pain endured. And weeks of adjusted work became months, months turned into a year. The pain stayed the same to the cost of several different treatments. Every step I take on that foot is the same as getting stabbed. Even when I did not stand on it for 4 hours, 10 minutes of walking made the pain come back, 50x worse than it was before. And as my inactivity began to extend, so did my weight. And in the meantime, gossip &amp; bullying started to become a regular occurence. To the point where the bullies claimed I did not deserve a lunch break, or that I am doing nothing but sit on my ass an entire day... I had multiple talks about it, every time the promise of betterment was made. But every time, the bullying became worse. My mental state began to decline. Up to the point where I left half an hour earlier because I could not take the abuse no more and told my boss how I felt. And so, I was brought up for a final conversation. I could not even defend myself this time. ""it is time to let you go"", and was ordered to give everything back, from keys to badge... &amp;#x200B;This job was all I had. it was my jumpstart to a better life, a one time opportunity that was wasted because of a fucking accident that dominated my entire career.

If I did not show anger and frustration all the time, I could have kept my job.If I was not honest about how I felt, I could have kept my job. At home, I have nothing, nobody. Because of Corona, all my friendships watered down to the point where they did not reply back. Work was all I had. And now I do not have anything. Nobody to talk to, nobody to vent to. Alone, at the age of 26. Sad fuck. For years I have felt miserable but it was do-able, manageable even. But now I feel worse than that.

9138,"Hi all, I relate deeply to a lot of the posts I see on this page and I would like to offer some encouragement.There was a long period of time where I was in complete isolation and the pandemic further isolated me. I turned to negative things to cope with the depression and loneliness like mind-numbing television, alcohol, and hanging out with people that were toxic for me due to the fear of being alone.After years of therapy and growth, I wanted to share some words of encouragement for all my lonely hearts out there &lt;3* Being afraid of being alone is totally normal.* The reason you may feel so alone is because you are not sharing with anyone your feelings. You are not being seen/heard in the way you need to be seen/heard. I hope this post helps you connect in some way to know that you are not alone and many others have gone through the same/similar thing.* Growing love and respect for someone else requires time spent with that person. Over time, you may fall in love or grow great respect for people that show you who they are, what they value, how they talk/act, etc. what is the difference between that and growing self-love &amp; self-respect? You must spend that time with yourself to grow that love and respect for yourself. Alone time can be seen as an opportunity if we look at it this way.* To feel less alone, meditating for 5 minutes a day, journaling, and shadow work exercises can help you. A shadow work exercise that really helped me (that I learned through my spiritual journey/therapy) is to look at yourself in a mirror and ask yourself questions - you will be surprised what comes out.* Start some hobbies, anything and everything that you can afford to do. If it ends up flopping, that is okay. You can move onto the next thing and remember, you have time.* Over time, you will hopefully realize that time alone gives you the opportunity to do what you want, recharge, and protect your energy from people.* We are quick to defend others when they are talking negatively about themselves e.g. your friend says ""I am so ugly"" or ""I am so fat"" or ""I am so worthless"" - we immediately tell them they are not and give them a plethora of compliments to negate it. But when we are doing negative self-talk, we just feed into that and feed into that. You must be kind to yourself, you must defend yourself. Tell yourself you are having a bad day and know that it will get better.These are just some things that have helped me along my journey of feeling very lonely. I hope some of these things help you &lt;3TLDR; I have a YouTube video regarding these topics that I go into further. In my video, first I tell you my story, then I go into the pros/benefits of spending time alone, and then I finish with some friendly suggestions on what you can do alone. You can find my video by searching ""kelly guidance how to stop feeling alone spiritual chat.""You are never alone. I am sending you all so much love and light. Remember to always be kind to yourself and others. One day at a time. Friendly suggestions for anyone who feels alone &lt;3",Depression

I grow up with my mom and dad til the divorce MY DAD: was an ex robber / drug dealer and abusive men he was always in the mood to fight somebody and break them something also he was abusive to my mother. My mother on the other side was and is an depressive alcoholic and drinks every night till she is at least tippsy of drunk.She screamed at me when I was a kid til I was 15 or 16, like every day since I was in school, but never was abussive in a physically way besides she throw something at me sometimes. When she yelled at me it was not that normal yell what a parent does when you did something stupid it was pure evil hatred anger in her voice and when I started crying as a result she often said oh you going to cry again or I have you do not stop crying i Drag you on the hairs to the school tomorrow one day she said why do I have to be the one with such a stupid son but she sad it in such a way That I felt just cold I do not even know how I should have respondet to that.Also I have a unprocessed trauma because After the divorce I had to stay by my father every second weekend.And after one time I had to picked up in the first night as my mother came she saw the whole desk was full of drugs and after that night I couldt sleep alone and cryied every night i did not want to eat and did not want to draw ( I really liked to draw before). Til this day I do not know what Happend this night. ( could be normal abuse because I know when he hit me did not happed often maybe one or two times) School was also awfull because I was bullied for over 4 years straight and never had the streight to fight back, because I know when I got home my mother would be angry at me to for no reason.

9144,"I do not know how to express my thoughts and feelings without feeling like an idiot, I have programmed myself to never feel externally as a means of survival, I have a solid exterior but inside I am torn to pieces.During my childhood, I constantly moved around, going to different schools, cities, I was never able to settle because my mother is a hardcore alcoholic, running from any responsibility.I used to come back from primary school and walk in on my mother passed out. I used to sit and entertain myself for hours in a silent, life less home.I used to worry about bills, electricity and food before I would even hit my teenage years. I had to walk my mother to the shop, whilst she leant her entire weight upon my shoulder, we would stagger there, day or night just so she could get her drink.When I went to school, I could not relate to the other kids, I could not laugh with them, I did not watch the same programs or like the same things, I did not have any siblings, a father, I had no guidance.During my teens, I used to jump into relationships with girls, but I was never stable enough to hold it down. I would go to school and fight the other kids, distract them in class. I was full of anger and resentment. I did not feel understood, my teachers called me names, made an example out of what not to be. I was the disruptive naughty kid. I was given detentions, put on report, constantly punished.I would come home to the same cycle, my mother passed out, or mentally checked out. Her pupils would change when she was drunk, I would know my mother was gone.Now I am 22 years old, still living with my mother, stuck in a shit hole city. I somehow managed to get a degree, determined to fight against the hand I would been dealt.I have been through waves of acceptance, anger, depression. It never truly goes away.My mother stopped drinking, supposedly found spirituality and detached from her ego. I thought she was healing, I was so proud of her and for once my home started to feel safe...I told her I think I aced a job interview today.. She started telling me all of the negatives. ""The areas not safe, people there will hurt you."" ""You will not like it it will be boring."" ""you are bad at maths, you will not be able to do it.""I have a solid exterior, I am a fully grown man now, I am tall, broad, the one thing my father gave me was good genes. I am capable, I am strong, intelligent. I have held down jobs in the past, I was a manager before I went to university.Tonight I ask her to not be so negative, I ask her why she cannot just be happy and support me for trying to better my life.. she tells me that she has done her 18 years of service to me. She says I am holding onto the energy of the past, that it is time to move on.. She tells me I should leave the house if I hate her so much.. She tells me I am selfish, a narc, that I hold her past I have her head out of spite..I am sitting here feeling pain, I feel alone, there is nobody in this world who truly has my back but me, there is nobody to pull me out of the gutter when I am in need.. There is nobody there who will truly help me..I feel so jealous of people who were raised in a loving environment. I watch people I went to school with living life, driving, living independently.. Here I am, barely able to make enough to pay off my debts, let alone save enough to leave.. The rent in my city is insane.I tried supported housing for 6 months, but living around a house full of people with hardcore drug issues made me feel like I was still at home.. People trying to come into my room.. Dirt and grime everywhere outside of my door.. Shit on the sink in the shared bathroom..Everything is so hard. I am struggling to keep fighting. I cannot tell anyone how I feel in real life, I am supposed to be this big, impenetrable guy who people can rely on..When I try to speak to people, nobody takes. It seriously.How much more can I take? When will life cut me a break? I just want to be happy, I just want to be independent, away from damaged, crazy people.. 22M - Narc alcoholic parent",Depression
9146,"Sorry about this being so long, I have a lot in mind that I feel is all relevant to each other.I have been trapped in my house for months since I have left my job. I left because I did not feel comfortable being there and every passing day felt like a drag. I was not happy with the thought of me working 66 manual labor hours with only a single day off to really do anything for what might be the rest of my life. In hindsight, I think most of the reason why I hated being there was because I was always drowsy. I would stay up really late (because I hated work) and would have to wake up early. The entire time spent here at the house since I have left work, I have done absolutely nothing to try to improve myself. I want to go back to work because I feel like a bum for being unemployed, but I just cannot right now. My biggest worries about going back to work are either that I am going to be fired immediately (because of my general low energy caused by my depression) or that I am going to be ridiculed endlessly by my future coworkers because of my awkwardness. I do not know how long Ill last working there with all the abuse I am undoubtedly going to get. I have thought about what exactly is it that makes me such an easy target of ridicule and I have come up with a few reasons. The number one reason is that I am boring. I have little to no interest in anything. This really sucks because I have plenty of ideas on what things I can get into to make me more interesting, yet I can never bring myself to do anything about it. I GENUINELY do not care about anything and it makes me sad knowing that so long I do not do anything to improve, Ill forever have this problem of being boring and being the constant butt of everyone is jokes everywhere. I honestly feel like I am undeserving of any human dignity with the way people talk to me. Like if I am not allowed to have any pride. I often question my intelligence for what I think are pretty good reasons. I graduated from High School with no intention of going to college because I was completely mentally burnt out by the end of it. To be fair, I think sleep deprivation had a lot to do with it (same reason as what I mentioned about work above). I literally told myself that I wish that I could turn off my brain and never have to think again. I do not know if its my sleep deprivation, stress, possible autism (undiagnosed), possible ADD (undiagnosed), or maybe even a learning disability, but I have a VERY difficult time learning anything. My brain literally HURTS when i think about anything and I just feel even worse emotionally for not understanding it. This depresses me for many reasons. One, being that I feel like a complete worthless idiot who will never amount to anything and who is a slave to manual labor work. Two, It makes learning any skill more difficult tenfold. Three, I just simply hate being stupid. I look up to the intellectual types. I value intelligence over any other human quality trait and it makes me sad that Ill never feel like I am good enough to have friends, to have a soulmate, to be a father one day, or to even play a respectable role in society. Ill forever be some dumb laborer in the eyes of the people around me. Despite all of these things mentioned that bother me, I just cannot bring myself to do anything about it. I cannot go back to work because of the mental state that I am in. I will not last. I cannot pick up new hobbies/interests because I honestly do not care about anything. The abuse will never end. I cannot learn any skills necessary to improve my financial future and overall social footing. My brain hurts trying. I feel completely stuck. It does not help that I do not know anyone personally who would honestly give a damn about me getting better besides my parents. I think its safe to say that my siblings, secondary family members, and friends (do not have any) would not care. I am on my own here. I cannot bring myself to commit suicide just yet, but I do not think Id be too bothered if I knew that tomorrow would be my last day alive. I do not have much to lose. I also feel like I am living a cycle that will keep repeating itself with no end in sight. Ill find a job that Ill hate but I muscle my way through it enough to be able to afford another break. Ill take said break but Ill feel like shit knowing that it was likely due to anxiety and Ill feel like a bum for being unemployed. But I cannot really learn anything useful to advance myself to a better future. So when the money that I saved up for the break is gone, its back to working my miserable job. The cycle repeats until the day that I die. Any advice or possible words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. If I do not get a single answer then that is fine, I am just happy to share this. I forgot to mention this earlier. I am 23, Male, and I have had depression and social anxiety since I was 13. I feel stuck.",Depression

Since I recovered from the hospital I have had a severe depression.

I actually try to actively change things in my life by being more active, and I want you to know that exercise and being more social does help. it is just a little difficult to undo 8 years of depression. It feels like it is a part of my personality now if I am honest, and I do not think I would recognise myself without it.it is overwhelming thinking about how much I need to work in the future. I feel empty all the time. I just want to stop thinking. I tried counselling. It got annoying after some time as I was hoping for more insight to help me, but most of the time she just asks what I want to do. it is always the same follow-up question. It gets repetitive and does not feel like I am getting much value from it all the time. Maybe I just had the wrong expectations? Has anyone found counselling helpful?I have had medications too. It stops me from feeling intense sadness which helped, but I did not feel happy, just a void numbness. I am just tired, to be honest. What helps me keep going is just taking this life as an experience and not too serious. it is easier said then done though as I still cannot help but consider how other people think. I come from an asian family, and I do not want to bring shame to them, but living in a western country, I cannot help but dream of the freedoms my peers have. The only thing that keeps me going is that I am going to die anyway",Suicidal
9182,"I just really want to get this out, and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long, I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK, which means mental health is always a taboo subject, and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity, given I have done a lot of reading on the subject, and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school, excellent university, had great grades, show great social skills as a front whenever I need to, had a good job, then took a two years out and moved to Japan, and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong, I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",Depression
9183,"I do not know exactly why I am the way that I am, at first I would say that I am not depressed I do not match all the symptoms. That was an excuse obviously, then it got worse. It is a mix of shitty days and just being in the same room as my parents. I try hard to tell myself its not my parents fault you are this way but yes they are a big reason and coming to that realization really is disappointing. I do not know whether to keep asking my parents for help or just wait until I am old enough, but I have been thinkingShould I tell my friends? I do not want to force anything on them, or trauma dump on them. I just want to be acknowledged, I just want someone else to tell me you are not okay and need help besides me. I will talk to the wall for an hour telling myself all the reasons why. I want someone to know besides me? They do not even need to help, I just want the knowledge that someone else knows.

It just made me feel so worthless and shit, so I drank way too much, picked a fight with a friend, then walked home and made a shitty weak suicide attempt.

I love her very much and I would do anything to see her happy or smile. There is an issue that has been persistent throughout our relationship though and that is her depression.She has tried many different medications and there are ups and downs. Unfortunately when it strikes she becomes extremely cold and cruel. She walks away from me mid conversation, locks herself in the bedroom, tells me to go away, not touch her, calls me names, says cruel things about me, creates fabrications and refuses to get out of bed and try to do anything to help her depression. She frequently tells me to leave her when in this state and that I would be better off without her.Once the spell is over she is back to her happy Loving self with cuddles and kisses and words of affirmation.Now I understand that these things are related to depression, but my concern is the outright toxic behavior. She says that it is because her depression makes her push people away, but I am starting to question if this is actually depression or just an excuse to be toxic.I understand I could have posted this on relationship advice and I might also do that, but the reason I am posting it here is to get insight from people that have and are sympathetic to depression.

It took me 6 years to get my bachelor's degree, while other people I know are getting their master's or getting accepted to medical school. I am currently trying to study for the MCAT but I cannot focus and end up crying all over my notes. It does not help that my parents always come to me whenever they need help with anything. I have an older brother but he does not do anything the the house, he treats the house like a hotel and my parents does not bat an eye. They do not discipline him at all and place all the pressure on me. My mom would also tell me that if anything happens to my parents that I need to take care of my brother, he is 26 years old. He does not have any mental disabilities. I am tired I want to move out but I do not have the money. What I hate most about my life is that I have no power whenever I try to tell my parents they need to try to solve problems by themselves or ask their other child they would get upset with me. They say I am the responsible one. I come from a traditional family, so as the oldest and the male should not he have more responsibility?

I have no one to talk to, who will truly understand.

He always takes it lightly and does not fucking change. When I try to sleep or even masturbate, this is what is on my fucking mind for some reason (stupid brain keeps replaying all the shitty sounds he makes). He also interrupts me a lot anyway, and while I know he loves me, I just cannot deal with this anymore. I have told my mom about this, and she keeps saying all the ""stay positive"" bullshit; do not go on social media, and all that. she is probably right about the latter, but it is gotten to a point where I cannot change. She makes fun of me for crying and feeling low all the time, I guess it would make sense since I am in my early 20s and I should move past being so damn sensitive. I have friends that say they are there for me, but I feel like they will choose their family over me anyway. I am starting to hate being an only child (even though growing up I never had an issue with it. I was a happy, live-in-the-moment kind of girl). I have told them about my feelings regarding this, but no matter how much reassurance I get, I cannot help but feel this based on what I have seen in reddit.

I have a full-time software engineering job, I am in good physical health, and I have plans to go to grad school. Through college, I thought that if I work hard, I can enjoy later. I never went to parties, drank, smoked through my four years. But none of that matters. When my mom or dad bring up something even vaguely sad or ""deep"", my eyes already start to tear up. I hate myself for being like this. I was not like this before the quarantine, but oh well, guess the damage is permanent. I do not see myself recovering from this situation.I can already see my life ahead of me--perhaps getting married at 25 and popping out babies by the time I am 30. I feel so..useless.

I am just not sure what to do or if I can even cope like I have thoughts all the times of just letting go again or disappearing or even ending myself because I just do not think I can do it ? Like even on meds from my doctor and I am still thinking like this . I am closed off like I cannot talk even if I wanted too and I desperately want to get out of this fear but I cannot and I am too scared of everyone around me even the people who love me to try and talk about it . Anyway I am rambling but I guess my point is , if this is when its meant to be good ? And its just painful and scary to me even tho its the best I have ever had . Will I ever find peace ? Or will I just have to just keep pretending and struggling through it ? Its just whatever anything happens my mind always goes to the idea of jumping and being free . Fixing my life has left me more scared to be alive than ever before and I do not know if I can do it ?

I will graduate from college next year and I feel like a failure for not having a job too. I am really proud of them, truly, but I am also dead jealous of them. This feeling is rotting in me, making me feel like I do not have any perspective, feel like my dreams are more distant than they were before and I am too tired to run after them.

Sad because I feel like I am useless and everytime I try to talk about it, all I get is empty words.I do not know what to do, this feeling is taking away the best of me.

9236,"Before I explain why I am about to end my life, I want to clarify that I am not advocating for suicide and if I could help it, I would ensure that no one has suicidal feelings. But I am not in control. That said, I just want to get this post out there as one final affirmation of my existence. Now, as for why I am going to commit suicide, there are two reasons: My social ineptitude and my fear of human depravity. I will first talk about my social ineptitude and then I will delve deeper in the depravity of human kind and why it has fed my depression.I have been an outsider my whole life. While I did have a close friend group, I never felt like I ""clicked"" with any of them on a personal level. Regardless of how much I tried, I always felt different from other people, and not in a good way. If others were to describe me, they would probably say that I was ""weird"" or ""odd"" but not in any particular way. I am not sure how to explain it, but I have felt like there is some part of me that is fundamentally different from the rest of humanity. In some ways I feel subhuman, and that prevents me from actually forming meaningful connections with others. Speaking of meaningful connections, despite being in my mid-twenties, I have been single for my whole life. I have not even held hands with a girl before. Yeah, I know you are probably laughing at me right now, but it is true. I have been rejected more times than I can count and honestly, I try to tell myself that I have gotten used to it, but really, it is weighed down on me for so damn long. The only people who have been there for me are my family members, but as fucked up as it sounds, not even they are enough to keep me from feeling unbelievably lonely. I feel like if I cannot interact properly with others, I cannot function as an adult in society, and if I cannot function in society, then I might as well clock out. Additionally, I have been incredibly insecure about my mental and physical abilities, both of which I feel like I sorely lack. This has also created a social impediment between myself and others as it feeds my inferiority complex. As for the second reason why I am going to kill myself, most people are depraved. Plain and simple. I have been a true crime junkie for a while and hell, has it taken its toll on my mental health. I cannot go outside without worrying that someone is going to shoot, stab, or kidnap me. You might be thinking that mass murderers and violent criminals make up a small percentage of the overall population, and while true, I believe that most humans are inherently violent. Humans are just as willing to excuse violence as we are willing to condemn it. do not believe me? Look at any video on Youtube with the title ""Home-owner shoots robbers in home invasion"" or something like that, then go to the comments. I will guarantee you that most of the people in the comments section will rejoice and applaud the home owner for either gravely injuring or killing the criminals. Now I understand the appeal for self-defense, do not get me wrong. I do believe that in certain scenarios self-defense is necessary, but I do not believe that the injury or loss of a human life should be celebrated, regardless of the person. The fact that this opinion is unpopular terrifies me. It seems to me that people inherently have a violent side. This violent side is also brought out when you add personal property into the equation. I remember a few years ago I read a news article detailing an incident where a store owner killed some guy who tried to steal a pack of candy from a convenience store. The website allowed for people to comment below the article, and surprise surprise, people applauded the store owner and praised him for killing some person who tried to steal a bag of gummies or some shit. I am still baffled that people think that ending a living soul for some candy was a fair transaction. This has further pushed me away from human interaction as I feel like I cannot trust anyone anymore. Which raises the question, why am I writing this suicide note on a forum for the purpose of being read by others? Well, I do not distrust all of humanity, and I believe that this subreddit may have like-minded and kind people who will just let me say my piece before I die. In short, I am going to kill myself because I have experienced extreme social isolation and I have developed a general mistrust of human kind. I believe if humanity works on its ability to empathize with others and to feel compassion, then we will all be better off. Even though I do not know you, I wish you a good day and a good life. do not live your life in constant isolation or in fear of others. do not live life like me. If you do, you will regret it.

9239,"mods, I am sorry if this goes against the guidelines. I have failed in all aspects. i could not even kms properly. there is literally no reason to live. there is no reason to even be posting this, actually. my parents do not care about me, my siblings do not care about me, i have no irl friends, and I am pretty sure my online friends do not care about me either. why would they? there is literally nothing good about me. i do not even want a reason to live anymore. i do not want to get better. i want to die. my therapist is great. i appreciate him loads, but getting better is so hard and it just does not feel worth it. and anyway, what is the worst that can happen? i survive? with severe brain damage? i will not even be fucking aware. ill write dnr on the wall or something so they cannot do anything. i wish id done it ages ago. i cannot believe i actually thought things might improve. considering posting on /r/roastme so ill feel even worse and it will make me want to do it even more, except i do not want to show my face, because I am fucking ugly. either that or I am taking to twitter rand say something mildly controversial like spiders are not that bad. i know ill get attacked, because last time i was on twitter (over a year ago) i said one thing (what?) and got death threats. i wish someone would just kill me. i hope i get hit by a car, or fall onto train tracks, or get pushed off a high bridge, or get stabbed, or get caught in a fire. its so unfair. and i do not want to hear bUt liFe is not fAiR. i know. everyone does. and its not helpful. its so unfair that some people do not want to die and yet die.

9240,"I started therapy about two months ago. I have had two sessions since then. If you are wondering why I have had so few sessions, its because I am broke, also my therapist sometimes answers my mails too late so by the time she replies she is fully booked.I was able to schedule an appointment from the website where I found her in the first place, then she gave me her mail address so that is what I used to book my previous appointment. But she always answered too late, and one time she did not answer at all. And, you know, whatever, sometimes people forget things or make mistakes. She is not responsible for answering all the mails from her clients during the day they were sent.And then she did not show up. The way this website works, I do not really know if she knows its me, and the website is complete shit so I do not think I will be able to get my money back.I need help. I really need help, I am going to go insane. I have been trying to get help, and I am going to explode from all the thoughts going through my head and my goddamn IBS and all the other bad stuff that is happening that I cannot handle. I have nobody to talk to face to face. I have a friend I made here and we do talk to each other about our struggles but I cannot use her as a therapist, because she is a friend and not a therapist, and she cannot help me in a way a therapist can.So now I lost the money I saved. It will take at least a couple of weeks before I save enough money to see someone again. I have made a document where I talked about my past and all the dark and heavy stuff that happened to me and people I love, and now I have to start over again. I lost progress and I desperately needed progress.Now I will have to save money, find someone else, book an appointment, open up to them about all the dark and heavy stuff again somehow, have another session about all that stuff and what I expect from therapy and how this stuff is going to work, then I will be where I am right now with this therapist.Goddamn I needed progress. I needed the tools they would teach me, I needed their guidance, now I will have to start all over again. And I am running out of time. Fuck. Damn it. I got stood up by my therapist.",Depression

9248,"I think am going through depression.All i want to do is cry whilst all my day is filled with me meeting other people and pretending to be mentally okay.I would give everything for someone who loves me to hold me and say I am okay,and not crazy.I cannot tell any of my friends cuz i will sound annoying and they will say i am overreacting so i must suffer through this alone.Tomorrow i am meeting my nephew\second cousin who is 3.I do not have an option but to act as if i am perfectly fine,as i should be.I mean i have amazing grades,going in a prestigious school,i have the perfect family and friends.I think it all started 3 weeks ago.For about 5 days i was in a very bad state.Then a friend of mine,let us call him G,texted me and i helped him deal with relationship difficulties.Somehow that made me feel good about myself and i was happy for 2 weeks.Now they got back together and I am even happier,but the feeling of darkness returned.When i do not have anyone to care or worry for i feel useless.I am a very antisocial person so i do not have many friends,although at school everyone likes me.But for those friends i would give everything.You see G was the person i texted the most with.He stayed honest and very truthful to me which I am grateful for.He said how he felt which warmed my heart.The only think killing me from the inside is that i could not tell him the depths of my feelings.We talked about lots of things,i even shared childhood drama so he feels better.Yes i sometimes joked that i was going through something,expecting something more of a reaction.Silly me.Now that the little bird has flown out the nest I am back to crying.He is my closest person and i cannot tell him how i really feel,scared of his reaction and the thought that he might want to stop contacting me.Something i am experiencing once again.What the hell is wrong with me what is wrong with me?",Depression
9249,"Okay, I do not normally post my problems on the internet... but I am desperate for help at this point. I will keep it really cut and dry (this is years and years of shit, condensed) But I really want to know if I am being too ridiculous or not, because my family seems to think so...&amp;#x200B;If a family friend who lived in your house, with your family, raped you (virgin with a chronic pain disorder), would you ""expect"" your family to defend you? &amp;#x200B;Mine gaslit me and refused to believe me until it was found out years later he gave me vaginal scarring and HPV warts inside of my vaginal canal. I had to show them the proof from the doctor. He works at our family business, and lives on our property still. I have since moved out of town. But I cannot be anywhere near my family or even talk on the phone with them without hearing his name or his voice or the like. &amp;#x200B;I let my father (who runs the business) know that I was working on my case with a detective, so find a replacement truck driver because once he gets interrogated he is getting kicked off the property and fired. That was almost 8 months ago. Two months ago, he was given a polygraph and completely and utterly failed it. he is telling everyone at work that I am a liar and he passed the polygraph with flying colors. My brother is STILL best friends with him and plays video games with him 4+ hours a night almost daily. He works with him. My father refuses to evict him or fire him until he finds a replacement, which has not been working out very well. &amp;#x200B;I have been gaslit my whole life by my family, and have really bad C-PTSD that adds to my chronic pain. My rapist knows/sees this stuff daily, and I guess he decided to join in because he knew my family would not believe me or defend me... but now I am getting REALLY fucked up because I never thought it would go this far. I never thought they would spend years defending my rapist, I never thought that even after PROVING what he did, my family al would allow him to slander me at our family property and business. The PTSD and despair is so intense lately that I cannot pull myself out of it. I get an hour of therapy per week but it is not enough. I have been really screwed up the last several years, but after seeing my family treat me this way... after seeing my own sibling side with my rapist... after he gets to just keep going on like nothing happened.... after he gets to lie and tell everyone he passed his polygraph... after he gets to keep being apart of the family... after my family tries to make me feel guilty for having needs or feelings... I cannot take it anymore. I just cannot. &amp;#x200B;Is it ridiculous of me to expect him to be given a 30-day notice of eviction from our property? Is it evil of me to ask that he be fired so I do not have to hear his name or voice over the phone anymore? Is it fucked of me to feel extremely betrayed that my brother sides with my rapist? (my brother already treated me like shit but I never expected him to do something quite this screwed up. he is been shown proof that I was raped, so it is not just him believing my rapist, he CHOOSES to ignore the proof)... Is it wrong to expect a ""family friend"" that is ""basically a 2nd son"" to my father, to get removed from our family? Is 7+ months long enough time to ""prepare"" to replace him? Am I asking too much? I feel I literally CANNOT move on or continue breathing if I have to have him involved in my life in any way, shape, or form. My only choice has been to stop speaking to my family members. But that does not stop me from suffocating in the toxicity from afar while my family just sits idly by letting him slander me to everyone around them. It does not help me move on. It does not fix anything. I am just secluding myself more and more. I have never asked for anything this selfish in my life, so I feel INSANELY guilty for even asking for it... but I would rather DIE than to keep enduring this, and having this make my chronic pain even worse. I just need him out. I need him gone. &amp;#x200B;I will not even go into even more fucked up details, but he also stalks women around town, and is still a sexual predator, and might possibly have an attraction to children as well given his odd behavior. Unfortunately I cannot go after him for my rape because I did not get a rape kit done (because I knew my family would refuse to drive me at the time, cannot drive myself with my condition. I was terrified and knew the gaslighting would trigger me to kill myself in a heartbeat with how fragile I was). But here I am, years later, still stuck in this crossroads. And now it is even worse. I just want the pain to fucking end. This is way too hard to endure alone as a handi-cap person.&amp;#x200B; Do my feelings seem justified, or am I being ridiculous? I have to ask because my entire life I have been convinced my feelings are always wrong, and I do not think ""normally"" as other people do. So I would like to ask the Reddit community---What do you think a ""normal"" reaction to this situation would be? If something like this was happening to you, what would you do?

The guy suddenly turned around and swung his fist right into my face. It all happened in a flash. I fell down on the floor and the man just kept hitting me over and over again until two customers and restrained him. The employees called an ambulance and the police to arrest the guy. All the while the man kept screaming and telling me how much of a piece of shit I was and that Latinos like me should go back to their own country. I was taken to the hospital: got a broken nose and a black eye. I was discharged that same day and returned home feeling like complete crap and hungry. Before falling asleep I kept blaming myself for calling out that guy and how I should have just minded my own damn business. I felt guilt, powerless and sad at the whole turn of events.

9298,"this is my first reddit post ever. I am wondering is this suicidal ideation the normal one I have always had, just with some of the emotion and anxiety lifted because of the meds? or is it additional from the meds? before the meds I have thought a lot about it and known already that it would be more preferable to not live in this horrid world than it would be. I am 36 so have had time to think and learn about the state of things. I am not the type to do the typical life with kids house all that stuff. I am really philosophical and get caught up in existential crisis all the time, the fact alone that people eat animals sends me into a dark spiral of not wanting to exist anymore. and then I think about things like people force feeding street drugs to babies,..and obviously everything else that happens. and that people do not give a SHIT. about. anything. the earth, animals,other humans,anything. its sickening amd i just cannot handle it anymore.anyway, I do not think there is anything wrong with not wanting to live in a world like this, after all we were never given a choice. in fact I think it is normal *not* to want to, but that is just hushed in our society.so before starting the SSRI (generic lexapro) I already knew and felt this, but was SO overwhelmed with these thoughts and extreme extreme emotion and panic from it, along w the disarray of late diagnosed and unmanaged adult ADHD life, i felt like i was exploding more every day. i could not even think about existence because it is just too unfathomable and awful that this is how things are. i was at my wits end and its what eventually made me decide to take the SSRI (in addition to already taking a very low dose stim for adhd ), which I was resisting for a long time. always been anti-meds but LITERALLY could not STAND carrying on this way, so was desperate to try anything. i did not even care about my ""natural healing"" beliefs anymore. now, almost 1.5 month into the SSRI, it is like the emotion amd anxiety about this has lifted, but the knowledge is still there. I am very clear and calm about it now. I am working on paying down my debt, which was another source of my woes, and finally in a financial position to be able to do it. and regularly think about once I get all of my debt paid down and all of my shit squared off, I can then consider planning an exit, if my attempts at happiness or even just contentment do not work. I am close with my sisters and family but they just started having kids, have their lives, and do all of that now, I am so far removed from wanting or relating to any of that, and while I love them deeply and they and my cats are the main reason I *would not* voluntarily leave this earth... each of us can only suffer for so long right? am I supposed to exist in hatred and stress forever because I do not want them to be sad about me leaving? i know it would be terrible for them amd selfish of me but in the end, they have their lives and their families and their kids and they would be able to move on with each other. the more they start developing their own families, the more detached I become and drawn towards this plan. and I am not irrational, it is not like I would just leave all my hoarded crap for them to deal with. i would tie up all my loose ends first and make sure my cats had someone to care for them. plus honestly, its almost like its motivation for me to get my shit together, to fix my financial life. and it is almost like I am planning a vacation or a trip, I feel the same way, that same eagerness or like I have this thing in the distance that I can look forward to. I have always needed things like that, probably the adhd, to know there is something coming up. its just that this something happens to be the end of everything. which is relief!SO... is this alarming? i do not feel like it is, i cannot emphasize how surprisingly calm i feel about it. and like i have a secret too. but because I have never felt calm about it before, just want to reach out and see opinions. does anyone else feel this way and do you agree that its kindof more alarming to WANT to exist in this kind of world? at least if you are paying attention. and do not have kids to exist for.and i know I can talk to my or a therapist but I also do not want them freaking out and making a big deal out of it, that is why i would never tell family or the few friends i have. i think we are entitled to have these ideas. mostly just wondering if the SSRI is strengthening them or just lifting the emotion out of it. sorry so long. any thoughts appreciated suicidal ideation, recent SSRI, should I be alarmed?",Depression
9303,"For over a decade I suffer from insane emotional pain among other things. I have tried everything. Electroshocks (only effect was loosing memory for 3 months), multiple hospitals, various combinations of different pills, therapy, solving issues from my past, selfgrowth, practicing positive thinking (what a joke) and many other things. Guess what! Nothing worked. So I was like okay I really need to try everything before I finally go away from this sick world. So noone can say I did not try. I moved to another country (I am in Europe), I got amazing job (IT field), friends... I have everything. I should be happy right? I even went on vacation for 10 days (small sailing boat in Greece) and returned on start of this month. Everyone is telling me that I will never forget such vacation and that it must have been amazing but... seriously I felt nothing. They say ""wow such an amazing view!"" and I just cannot see it. My illness took everything from me. I cannot feel joy, happiness... only everyday pain. If you wonder what is my diagnosis then officially its schizophrenia. It was explained to me that its only because they can prescribe most existing pills with this as official diagnosis. Other diagnosis are restricted - you cannot get any pill you want/need. So trust me that I tried everything and even brand new pills called Reagila which should have been breakthrough in treating these issues. But during those years every hospital told me something else. I was officially diagnosed with so many things that its really just one big joke. No one wants to admit that they have no idea what is going on and that they just cannot treat this. Maybe in next century right? Well I am not going to wait for that. I mean they allow euthanasia for people who are in pain and their condition is not treatable. So what is the difference bettween those people and me?! I consider myself as rational person but I really do not see what else could I try. I think this is it. I give up. Now I am just able to function with Xanax (basically sedative pill) which is helping a little bit (pain is still there just little less intensive) but that is also not a solution since its addictive and makes you walking zombie. That little lie... I mean hope which I told myself everyday - that everything will pass and I will be able to be happy... its just not real. I am damaged beyond repair. Like old people cannot fix their legs, blood pressure and other things - I cannot fix my brain. Its time to face reality. I am in peace with what was, is and will be.

I have no joy anymore or any will to engage in my passions/hobbies. My most exciting outing the pst few months was getting a tooth pulled.

It was a dinner party and there were about 12 people there most were female friends of his girlfriend and like 3 guys, the whole night I felt so zoned out, I felt horrible that I was not being friendly or talking to the others but I felt so faded, the alcohol made it even worse. One of the guys remarked how I barely talked to anyone the whole night, I felt crushed, I gave the usual a xcuse of I am tired but it was difficult not to leave right away. I was the first to leave it felt like I was giving up officially, I came home and cried.. yeah a 22yr old dude cried after a party, I feel like I am just a loser and no matter how much I force myself I will always be a loser, I give up even trying anymore I am tired of it.

9326,"First time poster so excuse my grammar and format...I met my wife about 3 years ago, fast I know but I was so happy. I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her. But I want it to end deep down...I keep thinking I should have died in that motorcycle accident years before we met. If I did not have my daughter, I probably would have put a bullet in my head already.For all the mistakes I made...I am so sorry...I wish I could take it all back. I wish I could start over again. I was so happy for the first time in years...and now its all gone. I am such a fool.

I am college educated in what I am struggling with but that has not helped. I have been dealing with delusions and hallucinations for years. Lack of sleep, follows, of course, and while I am not medicated for these happenings I am well versed on how to.. handle them. At least I thought I was. It all started at work, right? Last Monday, a week from today. I was asked to speak with my supervisor right before she was to leave. She and her boss had written me up. Fine, fine. that is fine. I was fine with it until I realized they were lying about it. I had the proof. Proof somewhere, proof everywhere. Everyone Id told said it was ridiculous. I said it was fine.Until I looked at the proof. That spiraled into getting a binder to hold the proof. A notebook to write down times, a box of paper clips to hold proof together, a box of sticky notes to annotate my work lists and proof. I called off yesterday. I stayed up all night; the tv yelling at me, bugs crawling on me, my husbands itching disturbing me. It was rough, and it happened again last night, I did not get to sleep until 5ish am. But I got up dreading life at around 8am. The people at work are staring at me, my bosses plotting against me, my coworkers talking about me. I cannot handle this.

It really does seem like the best path forward.This past year has been the worst in my life, continuing a constant downtrend and I might be done. Of course it was not all bad. There were definitely some years, even consecutively sometimes, that made me believe that it would turn around, but I now have conclusive proof it will not. About a year ago, I wound up getting diagnosed with something new every couple of months and it looks like I can expect to be in constant pain until I croak. If I let it happen naturally, it will be decades. I still get to live a full length life if I want, but I do not think I want to. there is nothing so good in my life that makes me think sticking around worthwhile.I have good friends, a good job, a healthy social life, but I just do not want to anymore.

It feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. I am doing CBT and seeing a therapist every week, but I hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made.

However, yesterday I smoke some weed with some friends (who I actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values, toxic men, etc.) and then all of a sudden I am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl I met. I am a man by the way and I find toxic masculinity to be something I really do not want to be a part of but I feel I am surrounded by men like that in my life. I am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring, and I objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me, but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence, it takes one day to have it crash down.

I want to be a good mother one day, but this makes me question myself. I am my father, before his 10+ years of sobriety.I do not know how long I will live, or if I will die by my own hand. The perfect wife and mother would never off herself. Even dying under mysterious circumstances could bring suspicion. Not only that, but I have made a promise to care for my parents in their old age. Sometimes I wonder if having children would give me something to live for. Another strike against my qualification to be a good mother.I go through the motions, giving my all at work, in my private consulting, in my writing, hopeful that I will one day do something deserving of recognition and praise. I strive to be the best. One day, this drive may exhaust and overpower my body. Truly, only time will tell. I am suffocating trying to fit my idea of ""perfect""",Depression
9393,"I have dealt with some degree of depression all my life. I had a really shitty upbringing and ongoing depression passed along from my parents who are miserable people. I have tried multiple diff ssri s years ago during my therapy (Prozac, vybriid, Zoloft, etc) but did not like how they made me feel. Plus I got sexual dysfunction which in itself was depressing.I am at a stage of my life where I feel like I am better off, compared to before. But I still just get super sad sometimes, without a direct explanation. I was also diagnosed with ocd, because I become very obsessive when in relationships. I have avoided sexual and romantic relationships until I can learn to feel whole single. I have been in multiple abusive relationships before, and always used relationships to fill some sort of void within myself.Now, I am focusing on personal hobbies and career progression. I have a lot of things that bring me joy, things to live for. But those feelings of depression always come back up suddenly. I just feel really sad and empty sometimes. Since my past exp with disliking the meds I took, I have hoped to learn to overcome my depression on my own. But idk. Perhaps there is a chemical imbalance in my brain, like my dad told me. I wonder if Ill ever be able to be happy on my own. My therapist recommend I get treated medically. I have avoided taking meds for this. Thoughts?",Depression
9395,"Reaching out was tough, I needed a year of ""I can handle it on my own"" &amp; ""it is not bad enough"" to admit that I cannot handle it. So I went to my doc, got a prescription for therapy, even adjusted (in accordance with my endocrinologist) my HRT dosage. I had counselling interviews with a two therapists (which could not take me as their patient though) and I got an ""assumed diagnose"" for an anxiety and depressive disorder, as well as an adjustment disorder. After asking many therapists and being denied as a patient, I give up now. I still got a couple of suitable therapists from one of the counselling interviews, but I got no strenght or motivation to check them out; partly because I do not think my situation will ever improve; even though I wish I had answers.I am just too tired of facing this existance of suffering and loneliness, where it does not seem to get better. Of course, people always tell you that it gets better etc etc, but I do not believe the phrases anymore. I got no hope left and wish this suffering would just end. I just hate myself, other people and this never ending loneliness. Heck, I am that much of a failure, that I do not even manage to SH, while wanting to (yes, everyone would say that is a good thing, but it just makes me feel foolish).Meanwhile I am forced to endure this existence (IF I HAVE TO STAY, I WANT TO LIVE AND NOT SENSELESSLY EXIST!!) I toture myself with checking out social media and making me feel even worse or remind me of my suffering, while not being able to stop with this bad habit. *exhales*Just release me from this suffering please ...

9406,"hey. I have (F19) been suffering from depression since I was around 16. Over the years, I have been to a therapist (two sessions, she did not help and I cannot afford more lol), did a workshop with a psychologist and been to a psychiatrist (a few months ago, told me I do not need meds but we can revisit it in a few months). I just did a session with another psychologist, and I have just been crying from frustration. It feels like most of my time is spent getting these people to take me seriously. When I tell them about my problems, how I feel so tired of life and fatigued, they just tell me that I am young and I need to not take things seriously, because life is going to get tougher. I am just so sick of the lack of support. I spent most of these sessions telling them more about my symptoms, getting into progressively serious ones, and they just dismiss them. They tell me 'not to think about it', or 'be grateful for what I have'. do not get me wrong, I am grateful, and I already avoid thinking about 'it' to prevent crying, but Id still like to know how to get out of bed in the morning and not want to die. I am at the end of my rope, and done with therapists etc but my mom wants me to see one more. Does anyone else have advice on how to get these professionals to see that you have a serious debilitating problem that is affecting your day to day life, that I am not just going through 'being young', and how to stop them from giving you tough love and give genuine coping strategies? They do not believe me when I say I have actually tried everything (working out somewhat regularly, clean diet, cutting out toxic people and even fucking breathing exercises). Honestly, Id rather take antidepressants and finally take my life off of hold- do not have the time or money for therapy. But I am scared of going to another psychiatrist, trauma dumping and still being told that I should just struggle with this (when I am obv not coping and it is just getting worse) instead of 'taking the easy way out'.

9408,"So I started dating someone earlier this year. We hit it off almost immediately after I got out of a mentally abusive relationship (my ex continuously cheated on me and manipulated me anytime Id suspect it). I was not ready to be in a relationship at the time I met my current partner, but they changed my way of thinking by saying love does not have a timeline. Our situation started off rocky as hell, they still talked to their exes on daily bases, which is a boundary I created for myself. They had hearts next to their exs name, and flaked on me when they hung out with them. Had their clothes and belongings still in their home, and anytime Id react and try to leave they would offer to call their ex in front of me, or tell me I could go through their phone. I was not okay with doing so, and I still tried breaking up with them, but they always told me I was self-sabotaging by doing so. Being in a bunch of manipulative and abusive relationships I could not tell if what they were saying was true, or if I was just putting myself through the same cycle. Anyways, we continued dating and our depression does not make anything better. I know that even on my worst days I make effort to talk to them, but it gets tiring knowing that they still make effort to communicate and hangout with their ex while it feels like they are doing the bare minimum for me. We go from hanging out often to barely seeing each-other/talking in week intervals, although I understand the concept of space. It gets confusing knowing the state of our relationship. We work on communication more than anything, but no matter how many times they have said its okay to communicate anything that bothers me to them, it seems like it always goes up in flames and that my perspective is always false. With their depression active the past month, I just asked them for a little initiative when talking to me, its hard feeling like I am the only one who reaches out and knowing their daily routine of waking up, checking their phone, texting people and going on Twitter I feel like I am asking for the bare minimum when I tell them just a simple good morning text would make me feel a little more cared about, but instead they got upset with me saying I do not understand that their depression makes it hard to even get up in the morning . what is frustrating is that I know exactly how they feel because I experience it also. I just want to feel the same amount of effort I am putting out, but maybe I am lacking compassion in this instance? I am sorry for my rant, I am just feeling quite low in this situation.

So my brother who is 24 broke up with his girlfriend about 4 months ago ever since he has been down hill just about 3 weeks ago he opened up to me. He is a alcoholic drinks every day he is so depressed about his break up and I think that the root of this. He has cut him self multiple times. He drinks hard liquor now just to hide the pain. He tells me he wishes this would just go away. He said ever since he open about his depression and alcoholism to the family he feels more depressed. Today he has a appointment with a psychiatrist also I am trying to get him to go to AA meetings. But idk if I am to late because he is drinking at his job and he is drinking when he gets home. I am afraid he might kill someone and himself. Yesterday he told me that whatever happens happens and that he is not afraid to die. The big problem I see here is that when he is alone at his job a feel he looses the mental battle and seeks alcohol. I am afraid I am to late to help my little brother. Also I feel like my parents just tell him to man up and now I am responsible for him and if something happens to him its on me. I do not want to live with that burden. Idk what to do I could not sleep last night all I thought about was him. I have talked to him multiple times and every time he just breaks down and cries he is willing to seek help but I kind of since he is also suicidal.

9433,"I have entered what I would probably characterize as the darkest period of my life so far. I am in a job I despise, and I recently started therapy, which has overall been a net positive, but it is also forced me to take a long and hard look at many personal traits of my own that need a A LOT of work. I am realizing I do not have a strong sense of personal identity and that I have a much lengthier and more problematic track record of behaving in toxic and manipulative ways. All-in-all: my opinion of myself is quickly rocketing into the dirt and I am in the midst of the most intense identity crisis I have ever experienced.All of this and a slew of other unpleasant factors have left me feeling like I am heading right for a potentially explosive breakdown. Like, I am about to get married and I love my fiance very much, but making a lifelong commitment like that to another human being when I myself feel like I have no clue who I am, what my values and passions are, or where I am heading in life scares the shit out of me. I have also recently began indulging some self-harm impulses (which are relatively minor and not life-threatening or scarring) for the first time in over a decade which feels like such an enormous step backwards for me. I feel like a rubber band stretched to the brink of snapping and some unknown combination of time and/or additional tension will inevitably make me snap. I do not know what to do about it, because the more I think about the state I am in, the more I feel like I am spiraling out of control. But I also feel like I cannot NOT think about it because ignoring and repressing my problems and my mistakes is how I ended up here in the first place. The worst part is that, even though I can feel the meltdown coming, I feel powerless to stop it.

I get up every morning and go to work and then after work I just collapse and ball up and just sit there for hours not doing anything . I get up the next morning and do the same thing , so at least I have a routine . I want advice on how to feel for things , motivating myself to do things for me , not relying on others to make me feel okay. I work 6 days a week so its hard to find a therapist with my schedule is there any advice that I can get to help me get on the right track to feeling again? I appreciate everyone is input Am I ( M22) depressed or just empty?",Depression
9453,"Some background info first:Our relationship has been going on for about 3 months now. Although that is not a long time, we have already managed to build a really strong bond and our relationship has progressed pretty fast.I just recently graduated and am now looking forward to studying at an university.My boyfriend has everything going for him as well. He just recently got his own amazing apartment, he has a well paid and stable job and a supportive family. I live within a short distance away from him with my mom.Everything was going really well at first and within the first month of us dating, he told me about his struggle with severe depression and suicidal thoughts. In 2020, a lot went wrong and he was really close to ending his life. He names his mother as the only reason he did not do it - he did not want her to go through the pain of losing her only child. He already went through therapy twice that year (which did not help). Taking any kind of pills is not an option for him. When we met, he was having a ""good phase"", but during the past few weeks things have been getting worse and worse. Some days are really good, others really really bad. I have struggled with mental health issues myself, so I can relate to the feelings he is having to some degree. But his depression is unlike anything I have ever witnessed.When he is having a bad day and I am with him, we barely talk and there is a lot of tension. He tries not to let it out on me, which works most of the time.But it still hurts me to see him in so much pain.To listen to the person you love talking about suicide, is a feeling unlike any other. I feel like I am not able to do anything about it.We often talk about the things that are bothering him. he is just convinced that there is no meaning to life and everything is already going downhill for humanity because of climate change and never-ending waves of corona.(These are just a few of his reasons)I know I cannot ""fix"" his depression or really do anything about the issues that are bothering him, but I still feel so useless and hopeless.I truly love him and want to be a supportive girlfriend. it is not an option for me to leave him, even tho this whole thing is really testing my beliefs and draining my own mental health. I am incredibly scared of him making a wrong decision and I honestly think he is very close to that.Has anyone had similar experiences with loved ones that are struggling with depression?Is there any way I can help more effectively (besides just being supportive, listening, being there for him,...)If anyone has read this far, thank you and I hope that there are people that are able to give me some good advice(English is not my first language- so please excuse any mistakes or weird phrasing) I (W/18) am scared of my boyfriend (M/20) committing su*cide",Depression
9457,"first post here so hello, ill just get straight to the point, I am completely dysfunctional now. i do not have any motivation to do anything, school work, clean my room, take a shower, and just generally take care of myself. i feel so gross but i do not care that i feel gross, the only thing i want to do is play video games because it makes me feel like I am important. no one in this house is noticing either, i want to feel important to them. but it feels like I am just not to them anymore. i want them to say they love me and care about mei was so cautious about how clean my room is, i was growing up in a dirty house. but now its just a mess, bed is all dirty, floor is covered in my clothes, and I am completely unmotivated to put anything away. i need to do it but i just cannot do it. how the hell do i get out of this? I am so lost. i was fine before i moved here but everything just got worse. i kept my room clean, was able to do school work, and take care of myself. wtf happened to me I am completely dysfunctional and i need help",Depression
9460,"that is the worst. I tried to tell them about my huge mental struggle. At first, they were a bit supportive, but after a while they told me to stop complaining and get my shit together. I remember the day when I tried to tell my mum how deeply unsatisfied I am and she stopped me with ,,Enough complaining! Just do sthg about it.'' Well, after that, their impression is that things got better. I moved back to the dorm, so they do not see me often. They sincerely think I solved my problems. However, the reality could't be more different. I am totally losing it and planning my suicide. In one moment I am researching for suicide methods and in the other my mom calls and I respond with the lies I have prepared - how university is better, how my job is better, how I feel okay. And this is the worst feeling. Lying to my parents all the time. On the other hand, I cannot tell them the truth - they are fed up with it and have no means to help me. They would't understand. The worst feeling is lying to my parents that everything is OK",Suicidal
9461,"Honestly I thought I had my shit together. I was diagnosed in 2018, so I decided to take a break from uni. Got a whole lot better, like I stopped having panic attacks, no longer hated to see my reflection in the mirror, no longer sleep excessively. It was a good year of rest, and then I decided it was time for to continue uni, and I needed to do an internship because it was one of the graduation requirements. Never would I thought that this internship was going to be the reason I relapsed. Basically it was the only position that was available for me, the other places rejected me. I am only required to do a 3 months internship but they requested it to be 5 months and I accepted because beggars cannot be choosers. Little did I know that this place was a shithole. Communication was 100% online yet they will not let join any group chat regarding any project whatsoever because I am an ""outsider"" and ""temporary"", yet they also throw their responsibilities to me without warning, I am not given any mentoring whatsoever. I am a graphic design student, and I feel like i have lost all sense of good design because my department head keeps requesting outdated design and honestly they do not make sense. I have been pestered by a coworker about the project that she dumped on me without warning. I have been humiliated in weekly meetings. I am losing sleep and losing my patience, and most of all I lost my self esteem.I only have like 5 days left till my internship is over but every waking hour is like hell. I cry in the shower, before I sleep, and before I start work. Lately I can barely get up from my bed, make so little progress for work, and now I panic whenever I hear my phone notifications go off because I am afraid of what my coworkers would say bout my work. Plus I also only get paid 1/10 of our minimum wage, and i use that money to pay for my internet plan so I can work online, so its basically unpaid internship. If any of you are beaten down so bad by your surroundings to the point of depression, I understand. I have supportive friends and I can barely go through this shit. If I faced this alone, I am pretty sure I would have disappeared to a neighbouring town and change my identity, and made sure no one will ever hear from me again. I swear I am this close to giving up Depression relapse",Depression

9485,"Hey, everyone. First off, I will start by saying that this is my first post here, so do please let me know if I have broken any rules with it.Secondly, to give some context (and to also let off some steam), I am pretty sure I have been depressed one way or another for a very long time now. I have never been diagnosed by-the-book, but every therapist I have seen so far has pretty much let me know that it is there. From what I have read and discussed with them, my best guess is that I have something related to dysthymia, although I would say I am generally pretty functional - it is like having an autopilot which allows me to go through the daily routine while being miserable and hopeless (there is no official diagnosis because the therapists I have seen do not like applying labels and have not considered it severe enough to recommend a psychiatric evaluation).I occasionally get an episode which is worse than the norm. I mostly always feel a sense of generalised hopelessness and sadness, but the episodes feel like I am thrown down a bottomless pit of despair. I am currently going through one of these episodes as a result of recently having done a sum-up of my life during the past few years.My problem right now, and the reason why I post this here, is that I feel that my support group, my few close friends to whom I have only relatively recently started opening up about this, have started trying to persuade me that my depression's incorrect, somehow. I have been thinking pretty much all day that maybe I am just too sensitive at this particular point in time and maybe I am reading too much into it, but I keep feeling minimised and invalidated when talking to them (stuff like ""you have an incorrect view of yourself,"" ""you are being overly-dramatic,"" ""I am sure things are not as bad as you see them,"" ""maybe you have some form of dissociative disorder"" - this last one came straight out of left field, since all of the therapists I have seen so far have, at one point or another, remarked my fervent insistence on keeping facts and reality as straight as I possibly could). All of these just... hurt, especially knowing my history of deep-diving into my thoughts and realising that most points which because me my unrest are conclusions drawn according to objectively negative and damaging experiences from throughout my life.do not get me wrong, I know depression does not really allow for objective perspectives, even less so during an intense episode, but everything they say just makes me feel like they are not even trying to take it seriously, even for a second.they are currently insisting that I join them for a group call to discuss ""magical realism"" (an attempt at a joke, I assume), but I really do not feel like that kind of invalidation and minimisation's what I need right now. My question, thus, is how do I deal with this? Am I taking things too personally, is this entire thing just another element of my episode? If not, how could I politely explain this to them without them having a knee-jerk reaction? I am honestly reticent to broach the subject because I expect they will lean even harder onto that ""incorrect perception"" of mine and I really do not want to upset them more than I clearly am doing with my episode. Hard enough to open up about it in the first place... Thank you for taking the time to read through all of that, and thank you in advance for any advice you could offer.

9504,"Hello everyone,I rarely post on Reddit but.....I have nowhere else to go. I have talked to my selected friends but all your inputs are important. I would like to warn everyone this may have religious talks and depression....yeah....like that.....I have a bestfriend of 20 years. This year she will be getting married to the love of her life. I am genuinely happy for her. I really am. Here is the story: My bestfriend got engaged last January 1. She is currently living in United Kingdom, have a wonderful job and loving Fiance. After the engagement, she told us and her closest friends and family that they will wed next year July of 2022. So I was really ecstatic of hearing such wonderful news, at last she will settle down and create a family of her own. She told me that she wants me and our other bestfriend to be there at her wedding, we are three. we have been bestfriends since High School. I got fired up to save a lot of money for plane ticket and pocket money to be with her on her special day. Since I live in Asia, and the cost when you go to UK will cost a lot since our salary here is like x10 lower than what people earn in the western countries.&amp;#x200B;Til one time, she suddenly asked me if I could ask my Uncle who is a priest if Cohabitation is a sin. I asked her like why? She told me she and her Fiance wants to live together, because living in separate houses traveling back and forth every weekend is very tiring for the both of them. I told her if they want to live together without tying the knot yet is not a big deal. If that will help save them gas and transportation allowance, then go. But she told me she is looking for answers and admitted they are in abstinence from sex for how many months now. She felt guilt doing pre-marital sex, and she always seeks answers from God. Asking for signs and that. There is nothing wrong with that, I am a religious person myself but I do what I do. I know my limits. We have this saying in our country: ""God have mercy on us, man has their doing."" When I talked to my Uncle who is a priest and asked him about Cohabitation, he just straightly answered that: Cohabitation is a sin. And I told my bestfriend about it and she contemplated about it. And I know she is been asking a lot of people and even religious leaders in her country. And most of them told her there is nothing wrong if they want to live together. She is still reluctant. And fighting her Anxieties over the matter. To the point that we raised our voice at each other during a video call, because she told me that my life become shitty because of karma, because I lived with my boyfriend for 1.5 years. It was a really big stab in my heart, and I cried but I dismiss what I felt and I still prioritize her because I know she is more vulnerable than I am. Fast forward.......I do not remember if when she did announce that they decided to wed this year. I was surprised and partly disappointed because the first thing that I thought was that I will never see her walking down the aisle in person, and partly I know the reason for the sudden shift. But it was only a short span of time because I understand that she wants to live in peace with the blessing of God. I just express how surprised I am, and I told her I am happy for her at last she will be settling with the man of her dreams.They will have a small wedding this year, and a big wedding next year which in the same month of July 2022.But as the months go on, she always asks me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look dissapointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy?* I always answer her: *People will be surprised of course, because you told them that your wedding is next year and there is a sudden change but that does not mean that they are not happy. do not ever think that.* I know it is her Anxiety talking. I deeply understand, because I also have one I have had depression and Anxiety for how many years. I always put myself in her shoes. Ever our other bestfriend she always asks about it, and she just answers: *It is you and your Fiance who will be getting married, not us, not other people. Only the two of you will create your own Happiness.*I also answer the same thing everytime she asked about it. Until I do not know what to say anymore, I asked my therapist and friends who got married about it. And they say: *Tell her that it is only her that will create her own happiness, not everyone else. But we know Anxiety is a big enemy.*My bestfriend become so anxious as months passed by and at some point became bitchy. Her patience shortened and at one point she is very angry? because the Bishop is not responding through her email, and she even told me if within 2 weeks he does not reply that is it. She will find another one. I told her that she is not the only person who will get married, there is also plenty of couples who wants to wed. And because of pandemic the rules and schedules have changed, she has to understand it. And she was like: *Is this what God wants?*So after a few more weeks, she decided to transfer to another Parish, and to her surprise there are schedules for weddings, the Parish Priest told her that he is available in 2 weeks time they could wed if they want to soon. And she was shocked at how fast it is. And I told her: *There ya go, no worries in finding a Priest and you have a schedule.* And she answered me: *It is too fast and too much.*The priest asked them if they have a venue already? Catering services? Photographer? And others? and they plainly answer: *No, we do not have anything yet.*The official Schedule of her wedding is by September 18 this year. She became more anxious. I understand what they called wedding Jitters. And she still ask me the same thing: *Why do people have the same reaction, whenever I told them that we decided to marry this year. Why cannot they be happy, they look disappointed? Why cannot they be happy for me? do not I deserve to be happy? Why is it like that?*Last Friday we had that conversation again, and I told her do you want to know the Truth? I can give you answers but you have to be ready. So, I told her that the possibility is that people see it as desperation, lack of security, insecurity, something like that. And I remind her that one time when one of her co-workers commented that is she afraid to lose her Fiance something like that. And then the word **Desperation** struck her. And she asked me is that also what you think of me and \[our other bestfriends name\], is that it? And I plainly answered her: *No.* And there is another question. Were you disappointed when we announced that we are getting married this year? Tell me the Truth. I do not know what I was thinking that time but I told her the Truth that I was a bit disappointed like 50% but it was for a short time. And I am passed by it. It was a very long time ago for me, and all I am focused on is I want her to walk down the aisle. And even volunteered to process her needed papers here in our country.She told me that she was very disappointed in me because she was not expecting that of me. So all this time I was not genuinely happy for her like all of it is fake. I told her it was not, I actually felt guilty that time, that is why I want to make it up to her by helping her with what I could give. She even asked me if our other bestfriend felt the same way and I told her it is not in my position to answer on her behalf. She told me on chat that her friend in UK was so genuinely happy when she asked her if she could be her bridesmaid. And she told me it is better for me to take care of things alone knowing that people are genuinely happy rather than people helping me(which she is pertaining to me) not genuinely happy. I want to justify myself more, but she just answered **WHATEVER.** So I did not push any further, I decided that I just have to let her cooldown, I know she is very stressed out.&amp;#x200B;I contacted our other bestfriend and she called me and we talked a lot via messenger and during that time she is talking to our bestfriend in UK. She is a Teacher here in our country and her patience is kind of running out, but we have to remind ourselves that it is her Anxiety talking right now and we know she will not listen even to us. But my bestfriend kind of admitted to her that what I said about desperation kind of struck her, and somehow she thinks it is true. Perhaps?I decided to mute all my chats in Messenger because I need some time alone. And just played online games, talking to different people to shift my impending Anxiety again of what has happened. I feel like I am terrible bestfriend for that. I am also dealing with a lot of Shit in my life. But for me I have to prioritize her wellbeing. She needs me, and my other bestfriend more than ever. When I talked to my former boss turned male bestfriend I told him what happened, and what I like about his advice is that I am correct at some point but I should have told my bestfriend a **WHITE LIE. Even if she forced me to tell the truth about how I feel.** She seeks positivity and assurance. And I am the only person and my other bestfriend who can give her assurance for that. I learned for that matter more.I am just worried about her, because she is snapping a lot. Not just about the wedding but at her work as well. We told her to breathe. Last time she got extremely mad at her Fiance, because of a simple comment about the flowers. And she was like: *Who will walk down the aisle? Who is the bride? And our wedding is this year! Not next year!* And her Fiance was so afraid whenever she gets mad. That he waited outside her apartment for them to be okay. But my bestfriend just ignored her. But they made up, do not worry. Her Fiance just wants to know, what is their plan? And she admitted that we really do not have one. I told her you two to have to sit down and talk. Listen to what he says. You easily snap.At least they are okay now. And she found a beautiful wedding gown. Which is really really beautiful. But I still do not read her last message because I am thinking I might have to justify myself. Even my other bestfriend is also stressed out and worried that she always burst, she always explodes. She never cools down. I shared our predicament with my married friends and they told me wedding stress is normal, but not that much. Because they balanced things out and talk about it as a couple. I understand my bestfriend wants acceptance. She wants a wedding where everyone is happy around her not just her. She wants to be like that.....Even we told her plenty of times that other people's opinion does not matter. What is important is that they love each other.....but.....she will still ask the same question.....&amp;#x200B;I really do not know what to say. I feel like a bad person telling her how I felt before. I am sorry if this is kind of rollercoaster and long........I am just really worried. It is very hard to talk to someone with a closed-mind right now. Thank you for reading everyone. I feel like a bad person",Depression

9520,"Really struggling. I do not know where to begin..I have always had challenges. I have now been diagnosed with Bpd, which come with a bunch of friends; depression, ocd, attention deficit. Up until two years ago I was bumping through life, but then I lost my job, lost my house and was abandoned again! I have been trying to rebuild ever since. I tried to start training for an alternative career, then the pandemic hit. Back in June 2019 I was the closest I have ever been to taking my life. I made a promise to myself that I would wait at least one year to see if things improve. They are now worse than ever, two years on. I wished I had ended it then at least I would not have had to have lived through the suffering of the last 2 years. I am paralyzed by fear. But... I kept going, because that all I know. I re-trained into a different area, but am petrified to take the next step. I graduated with As. I have always had the security of being employed before - not doing it on my own. I would be dead already if I was not riddled with the guilt which it will leave on others. I just want to sleep forever, I cannot handle being in my own skin. I have tied to get help but have had very little, success. My last relationship has not been a good, I have just not wanted to leave because then I will have nothing. I just do not know where to turn. Professionals do not help. I have stopped talking to friends through fear of being blackmailed by my partner, who has threatened to call my parents in another country and send emails to my friends divulging very personal information.I live in constant fear and misery. For three weeks I have filled out diary cards. I have had one day, where I felt joy briefly 1 out of 10. This is no way for a human to live. every night I prey I will not wake up the next day.. everyday I wake up with a massive gasp of anxiety and affliction - as I once again reform the miserable predicaments, which are my life and know I cannot change it because I am flawed.

When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy.

Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",Depression
9524,"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home.It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation.Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist. There are days when it just feels like everything is shit, but I just push through. ***\[MODS: I am hoping that this is within the rules. I just needed to get this posted to keep being able to talk about that moment. Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit, and if there is one that would be more appropriate. Thank you.\]*** It took 32 years for me to open up about this...",Suicidal
9525,"My parents expect nothing less than a perfect ubermensch of a son out of me. They want me to make straight A's, ace college, graduate with a prestigious degree, and then get some high-paying job to make big bucks. Part of it is because they never did quite reach those levels of wealth. But the rest is just them having vastly overblown expectations.I cannot handle it anymore. I do not have any marketable skills. I am an asocial introvert with *one* friend who does not go to college. I have pretty much given up. I do not have any drive, motivation, or *anything* now. I cannot even enjoy the things I used to love like anime-watching/reading/gaming/whatever. Anything that requires more effort than browsing the internet in a mindless haze is excruciatingly draining on my mind. The only time I ever experience what can even be *slightly* described as happiness is when I masturbate, something I do 3-5 times a day because...what the fuck else can I do?It does not hurt. I *wish* it hurt. Pain is a *feeling*. You can focus on *pain*. What I feel is a dull ache, like part of myself is *missing*.I have realized that I will never live up to my parent's expectations. But they refuse to see it. I wish they would just accept that I am a failure. Instead they just push me and push me even though it is useless.Fuck everything.

9526,"I was diagnosed with MDD about 2 years ago. Since then I have been working with my psychiatrist to find a medication that works for me. This past semester, I hit a different kind of low. This rock bottom state made me miss a lot of classes. I am an engineering student and even missing one class can put anyone very behind. I explained my situation to my professor and she suggested I medically withdraw from the semester. After talking with my psychiatrist and new found psychologist I decided that withdrawal was the best choice for me. The process to medically withdraw is long and difficult because mental illness can be seen as a chronic illness. The board approved my request to withdraw. This is good news. Now, I am in the process of filling out a tuition refund appeal. I have to write a personal statement about my situation. This refund is worth $9,000. Also, I can only submit this repeal once, so I want to get things right. I am having a hard time putting words together to accurately depict my dip (to put it lightly) in depression. Has anyone else medically withdraw from school and been through tuition refund appeal? I had to medically withdraw from school because of my dip in depression.",Depression
9527,"I used to be okay. That is until I got hooked to anti-anxiety medication. Benzodiazepine withdrawal has changed the course of my life.Nowadays I see the world differently. I used to feel part of it. I used to feel like I had a place here. Lately I have felt like an outsider. Like I do not belong. I see people with their morning routines and just think I wish I had some structure like them. I do not have structure. I feel like an alien. Every single person I know has some sort of structure. I do not. I went from feeling like water inside a cup, to water being thrown out onto the street. My life was okay on Benzos. I could function without much anxiety. But I saw the writing on the wall. I was addicted to them. I could not do much without them, but when I was on them I was carefree, risk-taking and relatively happy. A lot of good happened in my life. I got married, was doing well at work and finally felt free from my anxiety. Something Id dealt with since I was young. From ages 24-28, I was under the influence of Xanax or Klonopin. Little did I know, with every dose, I was screwing my brain up. With ever-increasing dosages, my doctor eventually stopped prescribing them - after 3 1/2 years. I was at a high dose of 4mg Klonopin. Early this year is when my life was turned upside down when my prescription was cut off. I did not think much of it. Until a few days later when my body started shaking and I got violently sick. I did not know what was happening, neither did my wife. I started googling benzo withdrawal and found this subreddit and concluded that it was in fact the klonopin. 6 months later, I am at a lower dose (.5mg). I should feel accomplished. I should feel like I am making progress, but in fact I feel defeated. I am so tired. I am so worn out. I barely sleep and I am anxious all day. I am terrified of the real world. I have zero confidence in myself. I feel like a total loser. I could cry ever single day. I do not know what is wrong with me. If I had known that Id suffer this way due to Klonopin, I would have told the doctor to shove it down his own throat. This has taken my dignity, my will to continue and my confidence for the future. I do not know what to think anymore. So very confused",Depression
9555,"When I was younger I knew my mother was unstable. I do not blame her because she married my father knowing that he is an alcoholic who smokes weed constantly and never helps out around the household. They treated my brother normally since he is the first born but still he is low contact because of the instability of the household. For example, screaming matches and me stepping between them and me being the ""peacemaker"" and praising me for it. Not being able to use the bathroom at night, which led to some serious issues. But now I have horrible depression. Everone treats me normally now since I am an adult, and even everyone is normal and happy in a way. But it is just the trauma from my childhood still lingers and it makes me so depressed. I even developed my father's alcoholic tendencies, and my mother's ability to not handle any kind of stress without breaking down. I am failing most of my classes, but cannot tell them because last time I told them I failed one class they almost drove me to the point of driving me to the brink with mental abuse and other horrific languages. I just do not know what to do about it anymore since I am at the point where I am in between and cannot tell anyone. Called all the hotlines, talked to groups where I lived. Just depressed. Treated horribly as a child but better now? Still have serious depression.",Depression
9556,"I have struggled long and hard with depression and anxiety since I was 17. I spent years in therapy learning to work with it and my battle hit its peak in Mar 2019. I have an extensive list of mental illness diagnoses (Depression, Panic Disorder, OCD, Eating Disorder, Complex Trauma) and I have tried almost every form of treatment out there.At my lowest point, I started having multiple panic attacks everyday. I started not being able to commute to work or focus during meetings and I was highly encouraged by my medical team to quit my job after a couple of months into my first position as a fresh graduate. I was the only university graduate of my family and my wide-ranging experiences from juggling work and study placed me in a position where I was the highest earning member of my household. My family struggled with finances while I was growing up because my mother was the sole bread winner after my parents divorced and I always had to make the most practical decisions, even when we had to move from house to house because we could not afford to pay for utilities. One of my close family members was also facing trial for a legal implication at that point and we knew our finances were tight. So even the idea of having to leave my job made no sense at all and it seemed like such an out-of-character move for me. I cried and cried, and negotiated and compromised (because I still had student loans to pay off) but I could not avoid the growing emotional debt that I owed myself. Leaving felt like the biggest failure of all and I dealt with a lot of arguments and apprehension, but I did it. I re-scaled my budget, reviewed my expenses, modified my lifestyle and I made it work. Fast forward a couple of months into intensive treatment, I received my childhood trauma diagnosis and the battle of inner conflict ensued. It took me a really, really long time to process all the violence, sexual assault, emotional abuse, manipulation and blackmail from the past 2 decades of my lifetime. And because I dealt with so much pain and struggle, I was hospitalised for an attempted suicide in Dec 2020. I felt like I just did not want to be a part of this life anymore and I just really wanted a way out (I still cry when I think about this). I survived and it felt like such a burden back then and I did not know how to process all of it, but I started learning how to set boundaries and I let people go. I gave myself time, and I told myself that if I was going to live, it would be on my terms. I gradually started working from home for one of my previous bosses after I rested and once my finances were strong enough, I moved out of my familys house (which spurred another round of conflict and guilt-tripping) with my sister and our cat, and I swear that was the best decision I have ever made.Fast forward to today, I finally spoke to my boss (who has been extremely patient and understanding about my mental health situation) and we have agreed that I can gradually start moving back to working full-time with the adjusted pay and benefits to suit. I do not share the full details of my story because there is still a lot of guilt and sensitivity about it. But at my lowest, when I was posting on forums about leaving my job and about my mental illnesses, someone commented on my post saying that he/ she was in the same position once and chose to keep working, but ended up not being able to work permanently because of his/her conditions and encouraged me to take better care of myself. I probably would not have been alive if it was not for that comment. So if anyone needs a sign today, this is it. Leave your job if that is what you need. Take care of yourself and just give life one more try. Its not easy, and if I am being honest there are still days that I wished I did not survive, but not today. Today, I am grateful If you need a sign to put yourself first, this is it. (TW: Suicide)",Depression
9565,"It all started when covid (march 2020) hit and i got ill and a family member being admitted to the hospital all while i was about to finish high school with a bunch of late assignments. Its been very stressful but since i finished school I have been super depressed because of the fact that I am always tired and wasting time. The things i wanted to do and the passions i had for all of my hobbies dissapeared.Due to this I have been seeing myself as worthless and a failure of a human being. I cannot count how many times I have been crying during the night when my family is sleeping, thinking about how I am not doing the things i want to do let alone being productive in my life.All that I am doing is mindlessly stare at my computer screen for hours and go on very long periods of maladaptive daydreams where I am acknowledged for my imaginary accomplishments and competence. Everytime i watch anime or a movie where the main character does something cool or whatever and gets praised, i often start daydreaming and putting myself in that scenario as that character and endulge myself in the imaginary praise, recognition and approval from others. As if something is lacking in my life that leads me into maladaptive daydreaming.As soon as i realize that I am not the person I am daydreaming about i start contemplating about my life which ultimately ends me in a depressive state.I hate being tired all the time i hate being depressed and i hate this anxiety that is killing me from the inside out. I hate being with people knowing my life are not worth shit and i hate trying to explain to other people that i literally cannot do anything because of this fatigue while being a slave to my own mind. All the problems i have with my body has been going rampant since i do not have the energy and the care to even book an appointment with my doctor. I even have no sense of care writing this with empty emotions. I hate having these suicide thoughts thinking about how I am finally going to get that day of recognition from others when I am dead. But at same time not feeling suicidal at all and want to live a fulfilling life. My life is a mess and everyone else thinks that my life is going well. I have always been good at acting happy, smiling and laughing with friends and family but as soon as I am alone i start living in reality and seeing my life for what it is.I really want to help myself since i still have my hopes and dreams but with this fatigue i cannot help but wonder if I am just going to waste my life away in my own mind, dreaming about being the man i want to be.This post is just me venting the frustration I am stuck and there is no end in sight",Depression
9569,"Went on a long walk after work. Lockdown has been going on for months. My evening walks keep me sane. The air smells terrible though.The job promotion feels more like a humiliation. Seems like I am only worth peanuts. I need to get out, but it is not like I am going to get a better job. At least my current work environment is nice. Every day, I oscillate between gratitude for the things I have during a pandemic, and anger at the futility of it all. I can barely afford to buy a place - will have to work another 20-30 years to pay off the mortgage for a shoebox in the air. Even starting a family is tough. I think I am going childfree. Money, money, money. I am working 2 jobs now, not because I am short of money, but having some extra cash, no matter how little, gives me more security. I am trying not to spiral. Maybe I need more sleep. And I need something else to focus on, a passion that could turn into a career. I did some research on grad programs and basically gave up because I am not ready to spend that money. My savings will be wiped out just to fund one degree. Even if I want to, the programs are too competitive, and does not guarantee employment or decent pay after graduation.

I am falling apart and its my fault like it always is, and I do not know if I can step foot in our favorite ramen place ever again. I am sorry I continue to fail and I can never succeed in being normal.For context, me and my girlfriend of almost 19 months are very close and happy with one another, but one of her best friends constantly makes me feel uncomfortable due to events in the past and how she would be dry with me but not as dry with him in our group chat (that I have been gone from since that day) It was her birthday, and she asked if I could go along with said friend, who I am uncomfortable with. I told her its your birthday, of course you can and she asked her friend to come. And she was worried before, and she asked me if I would be uncomfortable, and I told her no. And I failed her. I was so uncomfortable, the whole day I was falling apart, and she trusted that Id be fine. She trusted me and I disappointed her. For most of the day, I wanted to push myself to talk to her but as she was mostly with said friend, I could not do it, and was trying to give myself as much space as I could. I know I am such a pussy. I was falling apart and I was breaking down. I just stuck with her dad while the two of them walked around. When we went to said ramen store with all four of us I left at some point to sit outside and try to calm myself down. And later on when the day was finished we talked about the day and we talked about how badly I hurt her and how badly I made her feel, that she could not even talk to me on her day. I am so fucking sick of myself, I try to be the best I can yet I somehow fail. Its been a week since that day and were both trying to forget about the pain it still haunts me so much even though she is forgiven me for it.

Also, failing and being in prolonged pain or ending up with some sort of brain damage / in some vegetable state is quite worrying.

Hated every day of it but I persevered. so many times I wanted to drop out or end my life, might have even done so if I did not get a decent grade. but I got through it, the loneliness, the boredom, the racial abuse. I left with a master's degree. Now I am stuck in a job where I do not get to use any of those skills. Graduated 5 years ago so I cannot even get a job in my field of study. Seeing drop outs and convicts still serving half their prison sentence in the community making more than me working manual labour. while I am here getting fat making pennies working in front a computer. cannot even move jobs because I would just have to work in the same field but somewhere else.

Before lockdown I made so much progress in the gym even kept it up during lockdown until I had to start thinking about moving up in my career.

I have no privacy because I am always bombarded with responsibility to watch a child even when the mother is available, I have basically become his mother and have raised him and potty trained him because his mother is too lazy to do it herself and instead she gets stoned with her boyfriend. i ask for money to do basic things like laundry and it always ends up being someone else's laundry money, have not had clean clothes in months. at first she spoiled me and buttered me up telling me to be comfortable and that it is my house too but now she treats me like a squatter even though I am responsible for the house being bearable to be in and not a fucking pigsty. i literally put my life on hold to helpher and now she kicks me out and calls me ungrateful for being upset and asking why I am ""sad"" . I AM CLINICALLY DEPRESSED AND HAVE GONE UNDIAGNOSED WITH ADHD FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS OF MY LIFE madam!!!!! I HAVE NO FRIENDS OR OUTSIDE CONTACT AND EVERY DAY IS THE SAME MONOTONY AND DISREGARD FOR MY EFFORTS. I am NOT FUCKING ASKING FOR MUCH. have literally gone crazy being financially codependent on her. just like my first step father did to her. the cycle is fucking repeating. i do not know what to do except kill myself or continue living this miserable existence. i do not know what to do anymore I think it is over give me your opinion",Suicidal
9625,"I figure this could be common with a handful of people. I always have thoughts before I fall asleep. Mostly dark and it gets to be very very hard for me to sleep. I take melatonin to make me sleep, But with it I have nightmares and all in all seem to not get a break. My sleep schedule has been extremely messed up but in my own sense its peaceful. I stay awake on my phone or computer till around 7 am let us say? And only then can I fall asleep on my own because my body is so exhausted. This ends up having me sleep till 5 pm at night so I end up not sleeping during the night and sleeping to much into the day. As much as this helped me sleep better I know It is not healthy and it really does not do well for my depression because to me it is, oh it is dark outside might as well stay in and waste my life away more. But if I put my phone down at a normal time my mind runs wild. And it is a very very scary place. This part is why I have came to this group to share. Whenever I over think late at night or let my brain carry on with it is thoughts it seems as if all my consequences go out the window. Like I am numb and nothing matters. there is been so many times all the reasons I am still here did not mean anything to me. And I tell myself just to do it, that the thought of holding a knife to my throat is overpowering my pets, my mom and my hope. If anyone has any advice to share to help me from thinking more positive or even not at all before sleep I am open to hear. I would like to tell more but I am afarid I have already typed out to much lol. Thank you for reading &lt;3 -&gt;I hope what I have said is okay, this is my first time posting anything like this into a group of supporters so If what I have said bothered anyone please let me know. And I am not trying to tell anyone to take melatonin but only that it is my personal way to sleep. If the mention of drugs or medicine is not allowed please let me know as well and I will edit this better. I have dark thoughts before I fall asleep.",Suicidal
9629,"So in my own (subjective) case, I would say it is a fight in and of itself just to recognise that you happen to be feeling the way you are feeling/thinking along the lines you are thinking because you are in a low swing and your entire perception of reality, let alone your judgement, is impaired.My brain has a habit of convincing me that something else is responsible; which usually ends up with me doing something radical like moving house, or even country, or just generally running from a problem I have assigned some imaginary responsibility to for what is, ultimately, probably just a chemical imbalance in my head.*Anyway* what I wanted to ask you guys is, when you get over that first hurdle and manage to sit down and concede ""I am experiencing a depressive mood swing."" How do you deal with it? It does not seem like something you can fight or attempt to deny, yet wallowing is counter-productive.Winston Churchill called it a ""Black Dog"" and I have read that it is useful to think of depression that way - some animal we have to cow or master, but I guess I am wondering more about techniques/your own experiences here?I can say that writing this was certainly helpful, so perhaps it does just come down to being able to articulate the problem? But that is not going to be a catch-all for everyone. What do you guys do when you are aware you are in a low swing? How do you deal with it?",Depression
9630,"do not know whether this is the right place to ask but hear me out.So one of my friend(let us name him J), he been through quite a lot - mainly anxiety, depression, and insecurities. My other friend (let us name him P) reach out to our friend group and said J has been ghosting us. Which is true, J has been rarely responding us even tho we reach out him. He said hes been overthinking a lot, his anxiety has been rising, and he needs time alone. Cut off from social media and everything. I understand and comply with his wish.However, there is something that is been bothering me with what P said. P suggests we should distance him, and show disappointment and negative emotions towards him. P believes that if we comply with him, it will only make him take granted for what we are doing and become selfish. Basically what P wants is that he wants J to know his behavior are cowardly and disrespectful to people around him, and that he should not ghost, rather confront us.I do not know what to do. Should we just leave him alone and let him figure it out. Or we make him learn that he should not ghost, but by harsh approach. Taking initiative and confronting him is also possible, but I do not know the right timing. If you have any other approaches, Ill gratefully listen to it. Thanks in advanceOn a side note, Ps intentions are for Js benefit. But its just not clicking with me. I may be bias by I try my best not to antagonize P.

9633,"I have this one asshole who i have to call my ""older brother"", and I am absolutely fucking sick of him. He is a self-centered, insensitive, narcissistic, disrespectful and irresponsible piece of shit. He can make all cruel jokes on others, makes faulty actions and just be so denial ,brush it off and laugh about it whereas if anyone makes a small mistake ( especially when you mistakenly touch his stuff ) , he would yell and shout aggressively, putting his rage on people, his ego is out of control and does not take any fucking blame. He is also a man child, 21 year olds but zero motivation and ambition, lazy as fuck and being overweight. He skipped classes at university, got failed in subjects, went home sobbed at first and then quit studying then blame my parents for his own crap.... All of this shit and he refuses to grow up ,he has no fucking regard for people's well-being .I am the one taking his shit the most because I am his younger brother, so he thinks he has the permisson to yell at my face whenever he is angry, even for no good reason. And he takes pleasure in , like i said before, making cruel jokes, demeaning and belittling others, once again I suffer from this the most. And i can say he is one of the biggest blame for my mental issues like low self-esteem and confidence, which makes me fucking depressed right now. I am quite a sensitive person who absorbs people energy and being really frustrated with hurtful words. it is a long term problem that I was being unawared of for a long time, only now i realize that it is mental abuse. Things are going bad for me.So i got into a brawl with him hours earlier today. He had the same attitude , being completely denial for his action, and when i mistakenly spilled some broth and he shouted at me. I have been tolerating too long.it is like an outburst of mine. My parents going to come home later, he is going to act like the victim. I hope my words can describe how much of a cunt he is for them. Sick of narcissistic sibling",Suicidal
9636,"I have been increasingly suicidal over the past few months. As I understand it, it started when I watched a video talking about suicidal thoughts. They said: &gt;A lot of people have visions or fantasies of what would fix the problems in their lives. &gt; &gt;I do not have that. I really connected with that, and I honestly feel the same way.I had a really severe crush ""break-up"" two and a half years ago, and I have not found anyone since. I have only had one friend in my entire life, and we do not talk anymore.I have never been on a date before. I have not even had anyone approach me or give me any indication that they are interested.I am 26 years old. I have been in pain for SO long that I do not think a relationship would even fix it.If everything changes overnight, and I have an amazing love life and I make friends to support me, and I get married a couple of years from now, I do not care.I have been through two and a half years of hell, and NOW people start to notice me? Why now?Where were these people when I needed them?**Getting ONE date, let alone being in a relationship would defy all odds for me.****In reality, though, it is nothing special. Like, at all. People talk about dating like it is buying a new pair of shoes.** it is over.I set a date. Unless something miraculous happens, I will at least attempt suicide on October 14.

9642,"I went on vacation this week for a wedding. I was the best man. I did it out of obligation to my best friend of 18 years. I have had active suicidal ideation and rumination over negative thoughts almost daily for over a year, following the end of my own engagement.The day before the wedding, I went into a canyon trail in the Rockies some 2000 miles away from my very flat homeland. I had multiple reasons: clearing my head for the best man speech I had not finished, exercise, and I was passively searching for a good spot to jump if the desire was there.I started at the bottom of the trail as miserable as usual. It was hot and dry. Hot sand was getting in my sandals.When you get about a third through, you run into greenery and you start to hear the promise of a river. Following the trail a bit more takes you to a small stream where you can appreciate the sounds and the drop in heat. The snowmelt will be almost ice cold on a scorching day even this far down.Up the trail, it gets a little redundant again, but just as you start to resent the effort, you see another formation of rock and water or a large ancient tree. As you get to the penultimate portions, you have steep rock paths that you can no longer simply tread without using your hands, but at this point, every sight you are seeing is more beautiful than the one that came before it, so there is only joy in the effort.At last, when you get to the waterfall, the payoff seems better than anything you anticipated. The pool at the base is knee-deep. The water is refreshingly cold and clear. And the sounds are more rewarding than any music you had on your earbuds on the way there.It was like a religious experience. It was fundamentally mood altering. The day or so after was the first time in over a year where I had zero rumination over negative thoughts, not to mention no ideation. And I killed the speech according to about 20 people. I was able to actually enjoy my best friend being happy. I was enjoying the new connections I made, and I really felt like my best days were not behind me.TL;DR: It sounds cliche, but try hiking, especially if you have something requiring the right amount of payoff for your effort. it is like a microcosm of flow (the psychological concept).

9648,"A part of me feels like absolute shit that I have come to the point of ranting on reddit because despite the amount of friends and other family members I have, it always feels like no one wants to listen to me anymore. And even if they did, it always felt like they are doing such a bothersome chore. Every word is just a copy and paste.Everyone only pays attention or 'gives a shit' because they do not want to look bad if I do end up killing myself. I absolutely hate it when people tell me that they will always be there for me and when I do come and ask for help or someone to hear me out, they are quick to go off and play games with some fuckwit of a person or just simply ghost. Even worse, proceed to say that they do not know how to handle it after leading me on that they are someone I could count on to listen to and whatever. Only then to have them one day come back and show how proud they were for helping some random person online who was suicidal while I got the treatment of ""I do not know what to say :("" despite them writing billions of words and poetry to someone else. Life sucks. People suck. My mum is shit. I just want to die. But at the same time, it is not death that I want?? it is just, I want to die so I can be reborn and restart somewhere else, where I do not know these current people in my life or be in the same family as my mum anymore.

9649,"When I was like 14 I was going through a hard time and getting suicidal thoughts like crazy, so I told my dad about it. His response was the classic ""suicide is selfish"" and then he proceeds to tell me I would get a straight ticket to hell if I killed myself because suicide is ""the ultimate sin"" so having learned all this, I decided to bear with life a bit longer hoping that life would ""get better"". Since then my dad became an alcoholic and my mom took off, leaving me and my autistic brother with him. I began struggling with my sexuality and started experiencing gender dysphoria, and over this past year I started cutting myself. I have never wanted to die more than ever. 3 times now, I have held a gun to my head but I was too chicken shit to pull the trigger because I do not want to experience an eternity of torment. I am not even sure if I belive that shit anymore. I am scared of death but at the same time I just want to escape. I feel trapped here, how am I supposed to cope with this world? there is nothing here for me. Only reason I have not killed myself is because of religion",Suicidal
9662,"I am such a retarded fuck up, you know what I am tired of hearing? I am tired of hearing my school counsellor or my soccer coach telling me shit like 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Surely, one would think, if they were capable of basic human tasks, i.e. Not fucking up everything you do, the most basic of tasks in a sport, or talking to people, or giving people eye contact for god's sake, you would not **need** to **artificially** boost yourself esteem. Because you **are** capable of those things, you are capable of functioning as a social-able human. You know how fucked my self-esteem is? Sometimes, well actually, most of the time, I hate having a fucking shower because I hate seeing my disgusting retarded fucking body in the mirror. Despite being told by some that I am too skinny, or that I am normal, etc etc. I still feel and I still am a fat fucking retarded loser. I do pretty decent at school, I got an estimated ATAR of \~84 for Year 12. I wanted to be a pilot in the RAAF, but how the fuck am I ever going to achieve that if I am just an autistic bumbling piece of shit retard who cannot have a conversation with their mates one on one. I can do speeches to a class, or hell, even the school fine; but when it comes to talking to someone or having a conversation, I just cannot. I literally want to kill myself as an escape. I remember early 2019 (I think), I was plus-oned (since I never get invited to parties, not even my own friends') to a girl's party who I somewhat had a crush on (if you would even call it that, I do not think I had ever spoken to her, even to this day). Being the socially inept fuckwit that I am, I practically held on for mercy to my friend group as it slowly deteriorated as they spoke to other guys, and women who they did or did not know at the party. Eventually I was all alone, kind of just awkwardly sitting on my phone in the corner while everyone was having fun in the pool. You want to know what I was thinking while everyone was exploring their teenage lives with girls or having fun with their mates? I thought about I could smash my skull on the edge of the pool hard enough so that I would knock myself out and drown, or how I wish, how I begged that I had a gun and could just shoot myself in the fucking head. I eventually had the nerve to walk out on the party while some of my mates asked where I was going, or that they did not want me to leave. Staying at that party would have done far more harm then good I estimate, in fact I **know** it would have made me more depressed on the walk home then I already was going to be as I walked home. Why cannot I just be normal like everyone else, is it because I am an only child who spent 90% of his childhood staring at the wall or watching TV on his own because no one was ever home? Is it because I was a fat little fucker throughout the entirety of primary school, and how being picked on for being a fat cunt has subconsciously impacted by self-esteem? Or was it that time in 2019 when I got completely dacked doing a pullup on the oval infront of the entire fucking school? (I was already a social anxiety-having fucking retard back then.) Holy shit typing this just feels good man, wow. Do I have asperges? I do not fucking know. Do I have social anxiety? I do not know. Am I just shy? I do not know. Do I have depression? I do not know. I hope I do not but I kind of hope I do at the same time so I have a reason to be so mentally fucking defective. All I know is that I have fantasized about killing myself since I was a 10 year old, and NoFap has merely granted me more time to think about how badly I just want to kill myself. How bad I just want to buy a gun, or join the army and just shoot myself in the fucking skull and just obliterate my existence from this Earth. On that note, I am not like most people who say they have ""Given up on humanity"" and how they are ""turning their back on humanity"". Because I am not angry at society or humanity, I know I am the issue, I am the defect. I am so lonely and I love this solace, this hole that I am in, this melancholy. It feels warm, cozy, it feels like I belong here and it feels like I am here to stay. I do not give a fuck anymore, I just want to die. Maybe I will regret it when I do kill myself one day. I am just so tired of being an autistic little fuckup loser. Sometimes when I get mad at myself or I feel stress, I just like to rant in my head how I am so much a fucking fat little cunt f\*ggot fucking loser, it feels good. Sometimes I like to pretend I am holding a gun to my head (or in my mouth) with my hand and just pretend I am pulling the trigger and that I will not be here anymore. I remember when I was a little younger, I used to go sleep, making a prayer (Eastern Orthodox) and just pray that god will kill me or end my life. I am just listing my thoughts here so if this feels a little disjointed, I apologise. I just wish I could be normal, I wish I did not hate the very existence of my being, my body, my stupid ugly fucking face. I wish I could look people in the eye while I talk to them. I wish I could talk to people. I wish I could talk to girls, I wish I could feel **not** lonely. I have done research on how to do those things, and it just brings me back to where I started. 'it is in your head', 'Get out of your own head' and the most useless of all 'Combat/Challenge those negative thoughts'. Just read that, kind of liked how I brought it full circle. I know other stuff about helping my social anxiety and stuff, people say just talk to people or talk to strangers, even just shallow talk etc. and it will get easier. Sure maybe it might, but I do not want to have to try man, I am so fucking sick of having to strive to be average instead of just 'being average'. I do not want to try, I just want to kill myself and not have to bother, just give up. Some of you reading that message above might be a bit smug and say, 'then do it, nothing is stopping you, just do it, you are just going to be another statistic.' Do you really think I care about being another statistic? If I had a gun, I would have already killed myself lmao. I would probably be dead in the pool or on the couch, I do not fucking know. I am listening to some Radiohead and just writing these things while putting on a good album of their just feels right. I will wrap it up here, how the fuck are people cocky? How are people arrogant or become overconfident? I want that shit man, surely it is better than every thought you have in your brain is either a plea for suicide or a neutral thought which manifests itself into a negative one. Anyways, that is all I can think of for now in my smug retarded essay. Comment what you guys think or something so I know my block of text did not go unnoticed. Or even advice, I dunno, I have not **totally** given up yet. Thanks guys. Self Esteem - Kind of just listing things to get off my chest",Depression

9670,"After years and years of people's bullshit, I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying, constantly being ignored or belittled, constantly being seen as not important, stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet. Usually people say I am grumpy, or I have anger issues. They usually say I need to be a happier person and be nice to others. Well to them, MASSIVE FUCK YOU . I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong, it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat, my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow, everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes. But I am too much of a pussy to do that. Instead I just reside to my own thoughts and being my own parent and comfort myself that others failed to show. that is why I hate being happy and that is why I refuse to give happiness to others when over the years all I got was hate and bullshit and disloyalty. I hate being happy and I despise giving happiness to others",Depression
9671,"HeyI think this is going to be sort of long but I need someone who does not know me personally to read my thoughts and give me advice on a few things.The first is that I think my views on society and even myself are getting changed by my friend. I am not going to get into detail as to what type of views, its not important, but I think because I have such a big need to get along with everyone and not upset anyone that I sort of just go along with whatever. The second, possibly bigger problem, is that the person I am dating, once straight and heterosexual, recently told me they are non binary. While that itself is not a problem, I am straight and I feel like its not fair to either of us to stay, but they make me feel like I have to. They always feel suicidal and I do not know what they would do if I left them. It makes me feel like a shitty person and I do not know what to do.Another problem is I am religious, I believe in God, but some of my closer friends and the person I am dating does not. It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes and I do not like what the talk about sometimes. Of course, I keep my mouth shut but it makes me feel worse in the end.Yet another thing I am having problems with is figuring out who I am, Id there is any purpose of my existence in this Earth. I do not know what I want to do, I do not know what I am going to do. I just graduated high school and I am going to college.

It turned kind of out of control and we decided to have a 2 week break. I do not trust her as awful as it sounds.

9685,"I wake up everyday thinking the only choice I have to end this numbing emotional and mental pain is to kill myself, but I have a child so I do not want to kill myself so I have resulted in hoping and wishing that if I accidentally get hit by a car or whatever and I die, it will not hurt those around me as much as it would if I committed suicide.A bit of a background: I had my child at 13, have my GCSEs, Alevels and a Degree. I have my own home and a job and such a great kid, like I am baffled at how amazing she has become.But I am tired, in every way, in every level and in every depth possible. I have a job that kills me mentally and emotionally and my daughters dad (who I am not with) makes my life difficult.The place where I work makes me cry on the way to my shift, during my shift when I am alone upstairs for lunch and I reached breaking point and cried during my shift to my deputy manager because I felt they was on my case all day. But I did not admit that working there makes me suicidal... I mean how can I? I decreased my hours at work 7 months ago as I was struggling so much with juggling the shifts and childcare, and I went on depression meds. I thought it would get better, but it has not. No change of hours has changed the fact that make me miserable. I tried and failed.My daughters dad, well can be a good dad, but picks and chooses when he wants to be. I have to travel up to 4 buses a day every two weeks to get my kid to her dads (as I do not drive) and back and the same again on the Sunday. At times I have to call other family members to do it for me as sometimes I am too exhausted to do it (especially after a fulls day work) and on the odd occasion he brings her back for me on Sunday or picks her up from a family members house but never actually from her school because he works and all that crap as if I do not. And when he does have her, he does not even take care of her, his mum does. he is in his room on xbox, at work or at football or seeing his girlfriend. Because he has a life and I do not as you can see.There is a lot more about why work and my daughters dad makes me miserable but its both long stories.The tipping point is work asking me to come in or to find other people to look after my kid if my child is off school isolating. I am a single parent and my work place keep asking me to palm my kid off to other members of my family or whoever while she is supposed to be isolating so I can work. They know all my family members work, they know my mum has COPD, they know one of my brothers kids (my nephew) has an autoimmune disease, and they now know that my daughters nannie ( dads mum) looks after 2 disabled kids. Does my manager and deputy manager still ask for me to find other people to look after my kid so I can work? Yes.I have finally rang my doctors to get an appointment for a sick note and I will hopefully find the courage to write up a resignation to give to my workplace too.Will I find another job? I am not sure because my workplace has made me so stressed, feel so worthless and feel as if I am too stupid. I feel like I cannot do anything anymore. I do not even feel like myself anymore; I feel so lost.I am lost. I have tried my best but I just feel that this is all there will be.",Depression
9688,"This is what they call a scapegoat personality. My father was one too. He was murdered and his whole estate was claimed by the government as ""proceeds of crime"" (innaccurate) - he was a multiple legitimate business owner/workaholic in the 2000s. It was by corrupt police that did not want him bringing information forward about them at his appeal. His confiscated assets were in the millions and years later I was told he was tortured to death in the desert two States over(right before his appeal date). He died before being able to show his innocence/expose the corrupt cops trying to extort him and regain his work and assets. He essentially worked his whole life from 4am until sometimes 12am (so all day/night and then some)at two different busy and lucrative legit businesses and provided employment to others not just for nothing, but to be spat back at in the face by all of them. As well as miss out on his own and his kids lives.I have been physically, emotionally and psychologically abused by my other parent as a child and every partner I have ever had (it never happened until they had me in a place where I could not go back or escape or when there were not witnesses). I tried to buy a house with my current partner just for him to use me as a stepping stone ""use"" being the keyword and everyone else has shut me out. I have not been in contact with my old friends or remaining family AT ALL for the past two years. My siblings are messed up by our parents but are Unhealthily codependent on our mom and scapegoat me in an unnecessarily psycho way as a display of ""standing up for mom"" or you could say rage denying that she was abusive af as long as it was not being directed at them... Cool.My partner since I was 21uses me to run around for his drug habit and would force me to do the deals while abusing me out of jealousy for the people I had to speak to to get him his drugs but he will not sort it out himself or help me. And he also then threatens to turn me in to the cops as blackmail for doing his drug deals when he feels like sneering down at me or is being abusive. he is also scary af and unpredictable (or should I say predictably abusive) when he does not get his drugs. He takes my house keys off me and kicks me out (I am part owners of the house not even sure if that is legal i told people this and no one cares he just says I am a drug dealer and they think he has a legit reason lol) and I have no one and no where to go. I just did a job trial and an educational course for the last two weeks which was government funded (same government that took my dads whole life away) the teachers were hella old and out of touch but ready to jump down your throat as if we are all feminist militant vegans ready to complain about anything and so this course went 14 days we did fuck all real learning and played games like hangman and they gave us ALL the answers to the assessments. all of them. It was a waste of time and a joke and probably a total of 15 minutes practical experience on a forklift which was the main reason most of us signed up to the course. They cut the course short and have not even booked an instructor/assessor so fuck knows if we are even getting qualified after that bs. My job trial on the last day the boss made some weird comment about my CV saying ""everyone lies on here"" (I think that is what I heard?) Nothing on my resume is a lie and even if it was there is no way they could or should know that they just did not trust me and had something weird in their head about me from the start. Not sure if they know my last name as same industry my dad was cleaning up in 15 years ago and they love shitting all over someone they were once jealous of. He was dyslexic and left school at 14 but just charging every day.I got ghosted by them but idc that much if I did. I almost prefer that to someone scapegoating me for something I have not done to make money, again. Forgot to mention I was really anxious bc I was told I could not take the day off the Forklift course the day of my job trial and I nearly cried multiple times sitting in class while they played hangman no joke and a legit crackhead on meth got to come back from the last class of students to take up our teachers attention the whole day while she sat at his desk and he essentially did her assessments for her. She was not trying man she probably did not even come to class during her course and she got special treatment to come back and pass. At one point teacher made an example of me in front of the class for giggling politely at the person next to me joke about might as well go home instead of play hangman... As if I needed to be taught a lesson in front of the class and this methhead chick while he ignored our class all day to help her cheat. I really want to complain to my employment agency who set me up with this course as we left at least two hours early each day and I am pretty sure they were funding this. If I did not waste my time going the last day I might have been better prepared and successful with my job trial if I had not been stuck there having anxiety and playing hangman while we watched the teacher pass a bad attitude chick on meth the whole day. I find when you are a scapegoat personality what you do does not actually matter. They will bend over backwards to block and cheapshot you while they help people who do not challenge them, their position, or their intellect in any way. ""The identified patient""",Suicidal
9691,"I wish I could just sigh and release everything but to be honest, all I really want in this life is to just be loved. To have someone who can actually touch me, most times I associate that with romance. &amp;#x200B;But it has been so long since the last time someone even touched my skin. The last time was 3 months ago and that was a mere millisecond of contact during a routine checkup. The nurse accidentally touched my arm for a brief moment when putting the blood pressure cuff on. How sad is it that I remember that after 3 months?!&amp;#x200B;That was the only physical contact I have had in nearly 3 YEARS and you wonder why I am constantly thinking about suicide? Is it not obvious?&amp;#x200B;I just want to know what it is like to receive affection on a regular basis. But it is too much to ask and I know it is. I cannot do ""slow"". Not only have I been cut off from physical contact, I have also been cut off from social interaction with pretty much anyone. &amp;#x200B;I do not know anyone where I live, I only have my brother and our relationship is more akin to roommates than anything. Seeing as how I am just a caretaker for him really, since he refuses to do anything for himself. &amp;#x200B;I frequently think about just getting out of here, away from him because I am not his fucking housewife nor his maid. But if I do not cook, then we do not eat. If I do not clean, we get infested with gnats and flies. &amp;#x200B;Seems every day is just the same. Wake up, try to figure out how to make my own mind a bit better, sit around, cook dinner and clean up and that is about all I can muster. &amp;#x200B;This life has taken so much from me and all I have ever asked for was love. I have never cared for possessions nor money nor anything else, just love.&amp;#x200B;It was a nice ideal while it lasted, I suppose. Because in this world, love has to be the last thing you want. You got to want the money and the job and the possessions first. cannot really function in society without those things.&amp;#x200B;And yet, even as I have grown older, I still do not want much of anything from your world. 99.999999% of it is completely and entirely useless. &amp;#x200B;Just basic stuff, you know? Like a phone, an internet connection, a cooler, a place to call home, a TV, some form of entertainment like video games or whatever, a bed, really simple things. You could toss in some gadgets if you like baking and stuff and throw in a musical instrument or whatever but you get the point. it is a very minimalist type of lifestyle. &amp;#x200B;How ironic, I suppose. I try to live with the least amount possible and by doing so, I have the least amount of people in my life as well. Who would have thought?&amp;#x200B;I try to change, I try to convince myself that I can change. But I am still stuck here, in this reality and I cannot lie to myself. I cannot redirect my thoughts nor shift them, it is all the same as lying. &amp;#x200B;In honesty, I just do not want anything anymore. I want to want, but I do not want. The motivation is not strong enough to get me out of my head. I doubt much of anything ever could be.&amp;#x200B;I have tried EVERY SINGLE THING I could find. Breathing techniques, bridging negative thoughts, cognitive behavioral therapy, I am even currently in therapy, I am taking medication every day and I suppose that is a +1 for me. I am starting to kind of build a morning routine and I am starting to take better care of myself but none of it is making any difference!&amp;#x200B;I am still alone!! I am still useless!! I still have not been touched in an ungodly amount of time!! I get the slightest hint of attention and I am like a fucking lost puppy! I will follow you off a fucking cliff!! &amp;#x200B;None of this is factually making anything about my life better. I am still miserable, I am still addicted to video games and YouTube and now Reddit has fallen in along the lines so I guess you all are just going to need to ban me. So I can do ""more constructive things"" with my life.&amp;#x200B;As if I want to be cleaning up this fucking apartment that my brother has no problem in trashing but will barely lift a finger to actually help!! And it is just EVERYTHING!!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to do all of this and be this person that I am not and I have to do it all alone because I am so fucking worthless and I have made some real shit decisions in my life!&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to have hope when someone comes into my life for a brief moment and then leaves after I pour out the darkest parts of me. &amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to believe that things can get better when I am not seeing any real results from anything I am doing. My teeth are getting a bit whiter, so I guess that is the only real plus there.&amp;#x200B;I do not know how I am supposed to integrate back into society when the smallest amount of attention makes me feel like I am going to explode and if that gets cut off... You can kiss all this progress goodbye. &amp;#x200B;I have been starved for most of my life. In one way or another, or multiple ways. But I cannot ask people to understand that. I have to be the one to change and I cannot make that change without experience to back up the habits and since I am so damn sensitive to attention because I am so fucking starved, people do not want to connect with me. it is a fucking self fulfilling loop of neverending negative feedback and experience but I am supposed to just be ok with it. &amp;#x200B;Yeah, it is ok. it is ok.

Despite my academic achievements growing up, staying out of trouble, being the second person to graduate college in my family, among other things, I have never gotten recognition from them. My brother serves as the intermediary, and he relays a lot to me from them because he cares about me but he is also the one in the family they are proud of. he is so much more successful, he is got a wife, he is in good shape, and he is just got shit figured out. And it just feels like I am just fucking sailing with no direction, holes in the hull, and no flag to be recognized. I am really trying but this so damn difficult. I am so tired of feeling this way, like a failure, like I will never achieve what my brother or parents have done, and I am so tired...

This is no exaggeration. And you may not know me.. I was a full time college student till covid 19 forced me to drop out due to my learning disability preventing me from taking online courses, the school had switched to all online learning and I have fallen behind due to fear of affecting my grades and learning opportunities.. also not having a car was not going to work.. I was going to school for medicine, sociology and criminology. I want to be a surgeon or a drug rehab specialist with a psychology major.. I also act and model and make music for my dreams.. I want to change the world and bring my creations to millions to enjoy but also learn from and be strong from.

I am sick and disgusting every day. My GI issues are annoying and make me feel like scum..I cannot even go days without vomiting or getting sick from stomach acid and weak.. My mom is basically killing herself slowly. She drinks 2 pints a day and chain smokes and is currently suffering from some sort of internal bleeding while skipping a surgery she needed last year and is counting on death. I am left to clean up the messy house when she does not and the bills have fallen behind to an absolute bomb.. I am 23 and I am the head of house hold.. I cannot do this anymore. Her old abusive narcissistic habits come out when she is drunk and she snaps at me or shuts me down. And my whole body shuts down I feel stupid and like I am not myself when she triggers those old things..

And now he is keeping my brothers away from my mom and me. We have not seen them except maybe 4 times this year when the court order says they have to be here a % of the week. My boyfriend is ignoring me every day now.. after I spent nights with him holding his head up scared of him O.Ding.. he pops in and out and now will not listen to me when i complain about what needs to be fixed.. he will not visit me when his father said he would be fine witv taking him to my house while he is at work so he could spend a few hours over here every other day.. but has never once taken the offer.. he did not show up for my birthday.. or our anniversary and I am falling apart. As I write this I feel suicidal and he is not here for me.. our date was tonight but I have not spoke to him in 15 hours.. he did not even tell me we were not doing to today and now I am just hurt because i did not even get an update. And he was not even going to be actually seeing me he said it would be a virtual date. But we live in the same state and he is treating me like a long distance Xbox girlfriend... My friends left the state and I have been canceling projects.. I have been laying in bed sad and barely eating.. even the weed is not helping. I hate myself. I cannot even remember what I look like on a good day and looking in the mirror is unbearable, covered in scars and cannot even finish school. I cannot even keep a car or keep my partner interested in me. I am a whiney fuckinf bitch.

Like I cannot even speak to him because he does not even look at me when I tell him he is not being very attentive to me or the relationship.. sometimes he does not kiss me when I ask or pulls away from me.. we have not had sex in almost 10 months it was one reason and now it is another.. but he is asked a girl in the past for inappropriate photos.. if he was excited to see some random photo why cannot he be excited for me what is wrong with me.. he does not even touch me like he used to.. I cannot even call him he does not ever pick up for my phone calls when i call him.. he even tells me he lost his phone some times... he does not work he does not go to school he plays Xbox and never leaves his mom.home and plays with online friends?

My health is deteriorating for a while now for no reason (I am not going into detail about that so please take my word for it) and I have never really gotten anything I wanted in terms of making progress towards the dreams and passion I used to have.Life sucks.

I mean, sure, when I was a kid and still enjoy video games I laughed and giggled, but that was not happiness.And ya know what, I do not even care about happiness. I cannot remember the last time I was truly *content.* To be content is to be able to sit on a bench, without any stimulation from an external source, and to be able to say ""woah. Life is pretty cool, I guess.""Yeah. Never felt that way and probably never will.Some will call me lazy or a loser, but from my perspective, life is not worth the effort.

Not my parents, family members, past friends, etc. They always get so mad but I do not have it within me to fucking say that shit. it is so far beyond my functioning that I feel fake as fuck saying it.But then other times, I question if I really do not love my parents. And for the most part... Well that is where I am going to end this.I am not happy. Life gets worse and I am not counting on the grass being greener on the other side.

Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i break, especially since he has been so emotionless since he started meds.Last time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions?

9727,"For the record, I am not suicidal and I never have been. But I am going to tell you something, a true story, that might make you think another way.For background, My mom's friend, who I will call ""Susan"" speaks Russian and English, so she works in translation at hospitals in the you.S.Susan had a client, who I will call ""Sandra"" was living in Russia. Sandra's son, living in America told her to come live with him there. She at first declined, saying Russia was were her friends and job were. But after a while, she agreed. But when Sandra lived here, she fell in a deep depression. She did not fit in, she did not like her job. She would spend a lot of time just watching TV. Sandra starts feeling suicidal, not caring about life. Always saying she wants to die. She becomes isolated, smoking and occupying her time with herself. Smoking a lot. After a while, she visits her friends in Russia. They tell Sandra they are worried about her cough. Sandra brushes it off as a little side-effect of smoking. Returning to the you.S., Sandra's son expresses the same concern. She says the same thing, but they decide to take her to a doctor. Inoperable, Incurable Stage 4 Lung Cancer.Instantly, her whole attitude changes.The amount of time she spent hating life, not caring, she regrets it. She realizes how important it is, and what she has. She has a few months left to live. And she appreciates it so much more.My point to you is this: I do not know what you are going through. I do not know how you feel. But I know that if you push past pain and try, and maybe you will have to try hard; to try hard to appreciate life, you will enjoy life. You will not regret hating life and feeling like you do not matter, like Sandra did. Because like her, you will come to regret it.I hope this reaches out to you, and guides you to a better place.

I do not even know how the fuck I have gotten as far as I have in life. And I am barely scraping by. I often have fantasies of the train tracks near my house. Its only a 10-15 minute walk to get there. I think about putting my head onto the tracks, listening to music, and closing my eyes. The only reason I have not done it yet is because I am scared.The only reason is instinctual self preservation. And I hate it. I do not have the balls to just up and leave in the middle of the night because I feel like my roommate would figure it out. Or maybe not, idfk. Maybe if I just pretend everything is fine for a little longer I can leave without a trace, and no one will notice until its too late. Hopefully it would be successful so that I would not have to deal with hospital fees. Tbh I do not think there is any coming back from a train crushing your head in anyways. No one would notice if I disappeared one day. I am going to go nowhere in my life. I will not transition, I will not be successful, I will not have anything good going for me.",Suicidal
9733,"No, really? Why have we have a species survived this long? I do not get how people can just live like this without killing themselves. I feel like my family, therapist, etc. think I am crazy every time I bring it up.I do not want to have a job and I do not see why everyone collectively agreed that wasting your entire week doing mind numbing bullshit that you hate was any way to live. I ended up quitting my last job after a few days. Just walked out on my lunch and never came back because I could not stop myself from crying. I get exhausted so easily, and cannot really do much for more than a few hours without feeling like I am going to pass out, and it is so frustrating. I was taking caffeine pills to keep me awake at work but they did not do shit. Maybe it is a medical thing, or because I am autistic, or maybe I am just fucking lazy. I dunno, but whatever it is, it made me sleep for 16 hours straight after returning from my first shift. I tried to kill myself the night after my second one. I kind of wish I actually wanted to die. I used to, when I was younger, but I did not really have any means of doing it. Eventually, I taught myself to find things worth sticking around for, no matter how small they are. But it backfired, because I feel like I have no choice but to kill myself, because I was born into a world I am not cut out for. Now the things that previously were keeping me here are just things I have no choice but to leave behind, and it hurts more than if there was just nothing. Does that make sense? No? let us move on,I am stuck relying on my parents for the time being which I hate because I know they just see me as a leech. They try to sugarcoat it but it is obvious that my dad resents me and I am just waiting for the point where he cuts me off financially because I know it is inevitable (especially due to the fact that I am trans and closeted and they are both far-right wackjobs who are a few Facebook links away from thinking the Earth is flat.)So having any long term goals or aspirations seems really pointless, knowing everything can all get sucked out from underneath me the instant they find out.Ok I am tired of typing now. going to go pass out. what is the point?",Depression

Full stop. I cannot find meaning, I have been trying so fucking hard but I just cannot. I have everything I could want In life but I find joy in none of it. I used to love gaming, and travelling. As of the past couple years I have not felt excited for either in any capacity. I have not felt anger, happiness or sadness in what feels like a lifetime. All I am experiencing is boredom and apathy. I am not even sure if what I am experiencing ***is*** depression, but from what I can tell, its at least a form of it. I have been to therapists and psychologists, I have tried CBT. None of it has worked. I am trying to avoid anti-depressants but I hate the sound of the side effects, especially the ones related to sex. Sex is one of the last things that distracts me from what I am experiencing, although I am afraid I am developing an addiction to it. I am not even suicidal. I just feel so jaded and tired of living. But I do not see a way out. Being dead seems worse but I do not know where to go from here.

I am at least not as severely depressed, but there really is not a day that goes by where I do not think about killing myself. I just think not many people in my circle, perhaps anyone, is really ready to have that conversation, even those who know of my feelings and thoughts. Of course, people are dealing with their own issues, especially during this pandemic, I just cannot help but feel like I have been going through these episodes of depression for the last five years. Five whole years of contemplating suicide. I am not alone in how I feel, but it never ceases to seem so isolating and that I am truly alone. Even getting a full time job did not make anything better; it dawned on me that this will be the rest of my life--wake up, work, eat, sleep. And everyday what I want to achieve and pursue seems that much farther away. Life cannot just be this, or else what is the point?

9751,Do I have a symptom/am I crazy?Okay so I (14F) have a sister(16F). And were pretty close like really really close. Our mother passed away when we was younger(she was murder) . 7 and 5 years old. So its really just us to against the world. My sister is really quiet and does not talk to no one. While I on the other hand is completely the opposite. But ig after my mother passing and other shit happening. I have this feeling to protect my sister from everyone and everything. Like I never been away from her for more then 3 days. And if she does not go then I will not go and vis-versa ( sorry for bad spelling) but yea I am usually the one to do everything(which I have no problem with) and I always keep track of my sister to protect her from anything and anyone because I do not want to lose her. ( our dad is not in our life) but whenever my sister goes to work we share locations so I check it every 5 minutes. Because every negative possibility fills my head that something is happening to her like she is getting murdered or something. She understands how I feel when it comes to her for the most part. But then a lot of times at night I go into her room and just cry because I cannot stop myself from thinking someone is going to kill her while she is sleep and take her from me. And I just watch by the door with something sharp. Waiting for someone to try to take her from me. And she is knows and she tells me nothing is going to happen but I cannot help it. Like she is mine(my sister) I cannot let anything happen to her. I have no memory of our mom. But all I know is once I saw her in the casket. I vowed to let nothing happen to my sister. But I think there something wrong with me because sometimes when I am by myself I just talk out of nowhere forming a plan to kill anyone that try to hurts my sister. And it feels like someone is talking back to me . But I do not even care I just want to keep my sister safe. So is there something wrong with me? Please help me.,Suicidal

I going to make it the best year that I can so that on my next birthday my choice will be clear. Maybe this is my last year that I will be here. Maybe this is the start to something amazing.

I want a family with the person that I fall in love with. I want a house and a yard so I can watch my kids (whether they are ours or adopted) grow up and hopefully be the father I wish I had when I was little. I want to go on adventures with someone and be able to have those stupid little moments where you know you have each others back 100% or you look in that person's eyes and you know they love you.

I do not want to die alone but I think I might have to and it is better to do it earlier rather than waiting around till I am 35 or 40. it will give people time to forget about me. This is all stupid as fuck. It all comes down to being alone and my brain not being able to handle it.

Stressful events always send me into a dissociated state it just depends how hard. Recently, on top of this, I was physically assaulted by a drunk guy. did not even know it was coming, I think that was the most jarring part about it. He was another resident of the house I am currently living at and pretty much harrassed me passive aggressively from the moment I moved in. My weight has dropped so low because my appetite is gone from stress. I am approaching under a hundred, its very bad but I just cannot make myself eat. I have such an intense sense of dread that it makes me feel like I am going to die soon. Not even suicidal, just that I am at the end of my life if that makes sense.

Then when It became slightly bearable, I started programming again (I used to be good at it but my depression took the fun out it). I admit this was a hard road since I was out of practice and when I was unable to code. I used to think how I wasted so many years being depressed and thus subconsciously slipping into it again.Again I had to pull myself together.This feels like never ending process since I have been depressed half of my life (I am 23M :p) but atleast I was not that sad anymore.So six months down the line.I am brushing up my maths (important for programming)Working out few times a week.Learning guitar (bought it years back but you know depression)I have still social anxiety and I am social awkward but that is another days problem.

He wanted me to be his lover.We were similar in personality and hit it off, he could fully understand me, even my slight sadness. I have never met such a person in real life before. We got along very well and talked about everything. I trusted him, he liked me. He was like another soul of mine. He also said that I reminded him of his past self. He was always gentle and considerate, just like a band-aid, covering my pain.However, from the beginning to the end, we only knew each other for about half a month. My days are numbered, so I said goodbye to him ten days ago. He did not respond to my message. But I am not disappointed, because this is his behavior style.Strangely, since then, I have never dared to review our chat records. As if suddenly, they became deserted ruins, overgrown with weeds, which seemed to be unreal.I cannot even think about how happy we used to be, and occasionally I shudder at the thought. Those memories have sunk into the darkness, and Michael seems to have completely disappeared.Yesterday, I went to talk to him again. I know, no one will respond to me. But, I am dying, I just want to find a place to talk to myself. However, when I wrote the first message, I suddenly collapsed. I felt like I have returned to an abandoned home, with old furniture still in place, but people were gone.I sat on the empty bed, trembling, waiting for his appearance. I felt like I was writing to a ghost. I expected him to hug me, kiss me, comfort me, and stretch out a pale hand and touch me in the dark.How unreal online relationships are. Are all the stories of your lovers true? Does your voice, my name written on your hand really belong to a man named Michael? Why are you so hesitant when I want a picture of you without a beard?I am weak and have a headache. it is raining outside. Today, I am going to commit suicide.

If we had broken up in some big fight or something, it would have been way easier to move on, because then at least I would have something to be angry at her for, something I could remember to remind myself that it was bad. But it was not bad at all. Every day with her was amazing. The last night I saw her, we even said ""I love you"" to each other. We truly loved each other, we did not want it to end. I still text with her pretty often. I know it would be better to stop so I can move on, but I just cannot. I cannot imagine my life without her in it.

I cannot stop thinking about her, and it is only gotten worse over time. Nothing distracts me anymore, movies, video games, exercise, nothing works. I can only think of her. I have done nothing but lay in bed staring for the last 3 weeks. I can hardly even fall asleep, and when I do it is only for a few hours before I wake up again filled with anxiety and panic. My brain cannot help but picture her with other guys, and even though I know she is not that kind of girl, it still kills me. I cannot handle knowing if another man gets to be with her, it would finally kill me.The worst part is, I think she is moved on. she is going on and living her life, and I am a miserable piece of shit who cannot get out of bed. I used to think it was just as hard for her, now I am not so sure. I could not help but tell her how I feel, it was eating me alive. She said that she still cares about me and that she does still love me, but she said I should try to move on. I asked her if she moved back if she would go out with me again, and she said maybe. But since she is not moving back, and she has her own life somewhere else now, it really cannot happen, at least for a few more years until either of us could move ourselves. But even then, I do not think she would wait.I kind of rambled on here, but basically I do not know how to move on. I am still insanely in love with her. Even though I KNOW it cannot happen, and I keep telling myself that, but it does not matter. I need her. I do not just need anyone, I had a few solid chances to get new girlfriends since she left. I turned all of them down because I could not stop thinking about her. This is just killing me slowly and painfully. I seriously do not know how I can go on without her.TL;DR - I still love my ex so badly it is killing me. I cannot move on no matter what I do. I cannot move on from my ex and it is killing me inside",Suicidal

I graduated on time by making up a bs half a credit and rather than any form of congratulations it was all surprise that I even made it. I did not work for a full year because my social anxiety was so severe after the years of isolation. I finally got a job that pays absolute shit but it is a job and I am slowly becoming comfortable. That was not enough, I need a ""real job"". My job is all manual labor and very real I just accepted shit pay bc I am terrified to speak up for myself. If I were to go to college I would be a burden to them and if I do not I am a waste of potential. Absolutely nothing I do matters to them. I have also missed out on so many experiences and only have myself to blame, no school dances, I could not even mamage to attend a fucking zoom graduation ceremony, did not have a graduation party bc of the panorama. I lost my mom when I was young and having her miss all these ""milestones"" is just salt in the wound. I am trying my best buy my mental health is absolute rock bottom.

9802,"This is this first time I have ever made a post here on reddit, so I apologize in advance for this not being very well written. I have had clinical depression and generalized anxiety disorder since I was 13 years old, I am now 18. This summer I have reached an ATL, or an all time low. I was hospitalized in January of this year and did not think my situation could get worse from there. I was wrong. I have driven away all of my friends with my erratic behavior and selfish choices, including my best friend from high school who I considered to be a platonic soul mate. I miss them and think about them every day, but they want nothing to do with me. I have never felt more alone than I have this summer. Luckily, my boyfriend of 2 years has stuck around, but today I found out that I am pregnant with his child. I am going to college in the fall and I am not ready to be a parent. The only logical option I have is to get an abortion, I have scheduled one for the end of this week. I am terrified about paying for it, I am a dependent on my parent's insurance, but they are catholic and cannot know about what is going on. I already feel an immense amount of guilt about screwing up and getting pregnant in the first place, I do not need or want my parents to think of me as a murderer on top of that. I feel incredibly hopeless and guilty and like the world's biggest fuck up. I am scared and I feel like no one around me can help. All time low somehow just got lower",Depression

Even normal household tasks make me sick. So I am stuck here always in the same spot. it is wearing at my sanity. I tried therapy, antidepressants, but it only made my issues worse.

9813,"how do you all, seeking here, not sure what for... (27yoM)I have been having difficulties with my mental health for some time now, but I feel it is reaching new depths - I am now more happy to spend multiple days in bed, comfortable and bored, than out of bed; attempting to progress, in any sense. I suppose it is far more comfortable to be low than it is to be perpetually anxious.I feel like I have read so much of the self-help literature out there, so it is obvious to me what must be done to pull myself out of this slump, ie; take responsibility and be accountable for yourself and your movements; recognise that suffering is a part of life and can be a useful tool; be aware of the things you are feeding yourself, both physically and spiritually; maybe create some sort of goals in a written format that you can regularly go over to keep you motivated and help you manifest; learn to love exercise, stretching and breathing; possibly explore some creative endeavours; be kind to yourself etc. (the list goes on). Over the past 6 years, I have sporadically tried to form healthy habits based off of the latter values and techniques, thus attempting to take responsibility for my own happiness, however, with each consequential failure, the more hopeless I am becoming - it has gotten to the point where I am doing the bare minimum, just to pay for rent, leaving me financially exhausted with little room and/or energy for healthy activity.I have also sought help for GP's and got in touch with a couple of psychologists - GP's have given me medicinal options, which have either proven to be unsuccessful for me in the past, or risk the danger of becoming heavily addicted, for example, to benzo's (I have a very addictive personality and have had ongoing issues with substance abuse, namely alcohol and marijuana). I have found therapy, so far, firstly to be difficult to attain, and secondly more homeworky (mood journals, document sharing, technique applications etc.) than is useful for me - this is my own fault for not properly following their advice, but it just has not been resonating with me.I feel like I have a lot to offer, but am having difficulties finding where I may apply myself. I do not care for money, to the point where it is reckless, but I would like to find a vocation where I am fulfilled. Because I have no certifications or qualifications, the roles that I am able to work are generally hospitality based, physical labour, or just general shit kicking - this does not cut it for me, and I find the little work I am performing, I am performing utterly miserably, spending most of the time in my head, cursing myself. I cannot sustain a lifestyle like this - I am in desperate need of money, but more desperate need of fulfilment. I am so lazy, but I am exhausted. I suppose I am looking for any thoughts out there, even may they be alternative and outside of the box. I am aware that this is not an isolated issue, so I suppose it is important for me to find insight in community.Be this a very broad explanation, it is the best I can surmise of my emotional state, for now. Whether my problems lays in being unable to accept my mediocrity, pure laziness or something deeper.. I am asking for your insight please, oh kind people of reddit. Alternative options?",Depression

I am also highly self-conscious as I am big, fat and ugly, therefore hate myself however I have recently been trying to work out with little success.At school I act fine, and make friends laugh yet I am in pain, I need to talk to someone and I have been giving hints to one of my friends yet I am not sure he quite gets what I am hinting at. it is just good because school takes my mind off of some things but it also creates more stress through homework and exams.I also think about how I barely see my dad and when I do I just here spiteful comments yet I got to love him, he is my dad after all. This really takes a toll on me because I wish I could have a stronger connection with my dad and makes me think about how lucky some people are for having their parents together.I always think about ending it all but then that thought gets me emotional because I do not want my sister or mum to go through the pain of me being gone because I love them both with all my heart. I am only 15 and I do not want to be alive, but I do not want to be dead either. I wish I grew up in another generation, my generation is fucked and all this technology messes with us.

I am convinced, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that 99% of humanity is sinister in nature, and wicked in their actions. I hate you, very genuinely. My entire being is consumed by an unquenchable hatred for my fellow human being. I was not always like this, though. I was a nice kid with a big, loving heart, even though my parents were meth head trailer trash. My innocence was systematically stolen from me over the course of my early years. I learned to hate, and I eventually lost my ability to trust other humans on any level. I literally cannot maintain any relationships, and I live in complete isolation, waiting to die. I had early childhood issues with abandonment that made me feel like everyone was going to suddenly leave me. I was not wrong. People are shit, and they will stick around as long as you have something that they want. You, the person reading this, are like this. No matter what you think about yourself, you are not loyal to anyone but yourself, and you probably do not even know it. Only broken people can truly understand the ramifications their actions can have on others, because they were once victimized by another's selfishness - their willingness to use you to attain a need or desire of some kind. In order to *truly* understand that, you have to have experienced trauma. Real trauma. Not ""I got a spanking when I was 10."" The kind that actually fucks you up forever. *trigger warning for people who cannot validate my experience, while simultaneously expecting their own experiences to be validated* You, at the grocery store, staring at my ragged clothes and greasy hair, please go fuck yourself. Leave me alone. Mind your own goddamned business. You, in the car trying to run me off the fucking road while you text on your cell phone, I hope you crash and your car bursts into flames. You, neighbor, slamming your fucking fist on the wall whenever I walk across my house - whenever you do this, I have a panic attack. I imagine gruesome things about you, and all that separates us is a paper thin wall that I could crush through with my bare hands. Fuck you. If you knew my thoughts, you would move. You, the guy who stole my car a couple months back. I hope terrible things happen to you in prison. You, the employer who stole thousands of dollars from me and my employees while I managed your company and literally kept it afloat through 2020, I hope your fucking business goes under and your family goes hungry. Fuck you. I hope your mansion burns down. I could go on forever. I despise you all with all my soul. I just had to say some of this. Keep in mind that I do not care about your feelings, and I do not seek validation. I feel nothing but hatred and sadness.",Depression
9877,"This is my final attempt at life, I cannot go on no longer. I can feel it, I only have a few days before I take my life. I am not Gods strongest warrior. I cannot bear the tests He is giving me. I tried so hard to be the person she wanted me to be. But its so hard for me to change and I drove her away. I know it may not seem like much but 8 months and a day after we were done she said she is ready to move on. Did she even love me. I drove around in a frantic craze trying to find an open therapy spot but its Sunday and nothing is open. Its currently 10:29 PM today and I can feel my life-force draining slowly. I am at my wits end. Someone please save me. The only reason I have not taken my own life is because according to the bible, people who take their own life go to hell. But i do not want to go to hell. I just want the pain to stop. I have been hurt so much by my stupid actions and I put the last of my energy into this relationship. She promised that she would not leave, and would stay by my side to try and better myself. Did she love me. The voices are getting louder and I cannot control it. It seems to spiral at nighttime when I am alone. I do not like sleeping alone all I could remember is cuddling with her.

9880,"I suffer from severe depression, anxiety and mild OCD (alongside symptoms of PMDD but it is hard to get a diagnosis; my psychiatrists are male). The purpose of this post is not to ask what treatment would necessarily work in my case, rather to ask if there is still hope to find an anti-depressant that will remove my paralysing symptoms (low mood, constant fatigue, executive dysfunction, etc). My overarching issue is that I find it increasingly difficult to study for my upcoming GCSEs and I understand that my grades are not worth my mental wellbeing but I live in an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household with parents that might just marry me off if I am unable to escape by studying abroad; I need to study if I want to be emotionally stable and independent in the future. Though it seems the drugs I have been on (Paxil and Lexapro) never seem to help enough, they might make me able to get out of bed and have the energy to socialise on mediocre to good days but I cannot put myself to work and critically think (I also need constant distractions or my obsessions/intrusive thoughts get the best of me) as to study. Has anyone had a similar experience where the use of another antidepressant has helped them to work long enough to fulfil their responsibility as an employee/student? Should I stop searching for help in antidepressants- is this a dead-end?TL;DR: If neither Paxil nor Lexapro work for me, a 15-year-old, is it worth it continuing to search for antidepressants that do? I am 15(F) and neither Paxil(25mg) nor Lexapro(15mg) have been working",Depression
9886,"I feel like such a failure in life. I hate where I am in life right now. I feel like such a burden to my family and friends. I have no one to talk to about anything. no one cares about me. No one loves me. People only talk to me when they need something from me. Everything I do is not good enough for anyone. I work hard, I save money, i got into a program at uni, but nothing is good enough for anyone. I am always lacking. I try so hard to be happy and to be a good successful person but what is the point? Everything I do does not matter. No one looks for me or misses me. No one cares about me and asks me if I am doing okay. I am no one's favourite. If I end my life, everything will be okay. They can live without me. My mom can finally have someone else to emotionally abuse. I am one less burden they will have. No one will miss me when I am gone. Everyone will just be sad for one day and then move on like nothing happened. If I kill myself, it will be my fault and everyone will call me selfish. If I decide to live, nothing will change. I will be stuck like this forever. I am tired. Honestly, the only reason why I am still around is because of my dog lol... I am tired.",Suicidal
9888,"I promised myself that id stay out of this sub when i made this account. Not going too well so far haha.... I have not slept in 24 hours, maybe more. I have lost count. I am tired but i do not want to wake up only to be faced with disappointment. The right side of my teeth hurts from clenching so hard for a prolonged period of tiem without noticing it. I had a mini depressive episode earlier and i think i might be going mad sometimes. I want die so bad, its all that clutters my mind lately. I am not going to do it, not yet atleast but the thought sits there and taunts me. It makes me feel like i should do it sooner. I look around me and its all worth doing. I could end things, not suffer a day more. I am exhausted of the acts i have to pull, the sacrifices i have to make. When in the end, I am still a miserable wad of shit. I want to rest. Eternally. Sure I am a bit stepped aback from what is beyond that but frankly, i care more about ending this daily fight than what comes next, i could worry about it when the time comes. I wish someone could blow my brains out. I am pretty dumb haha",Suicidal
9891,"Like my other reddit posts, people just do not seem to care about my problems. Today I got into a fight at work because I was told that my performance was low and was later blamed for starting a fight that clearly was not my fault (the other person was a coworker of mine who I absolutely dislike for being a snob and having a high and mighty attitude with everyone). I was treated like complete crap by my superior who promptly decided to fire me on the spot. I lost my job and reputation with my coworkers that day. Now, unemployed, I sink deeper into my depression and have started to develop nightmares and insomnia as a result of the incident. I cannot trust nobody, you are worthless are some of the thoughts that creep into my head during these moments. I honestly do not know what to do anymore. I have considered suicide but Id leave behind my family who live overseas and would hate to make them sad by my death. I feel trapped in an endless cycle of depression and abuse from others, that every form of emotion left in me has completely disappeared. I feel like, no matter what I do or say, no one gives a fuck about what me.",Depression
9892,"First off, I was in there with a guy who stayed 3 extra days because the psych forgot to give him his heart meds and switched him to Seroquel to see if his dizziness would go away. The dizziness was from her accidentally forgetting to give him his meds. That should be enough to tell you how neglectful these places are.When I was 18, I called the hotline. I said I did not want to hurt myself but needed hell. A cop knocked on my door while I was in the bathroom and took me to an ambulance ($250 fee) and then to the hospital (got a bill that hopefully was covered by insurance) and spent 24 hours on a gurney before they decided I was not a danger to myself or others and let me go. The day after my 22nd (July 2nd) I was on a multi-day alcohol bender and attempted (pills). Cops showed up and I was not compliant (kept telling them to leave me alone) and they kept questioning me and standing there. Apparently they were afraid of me ODing but did not bring in an EMT. Eventually they put me in handcuffs without even saying ""you have to come with us or we will put you in handcuffs"". They also came in through the side door and unlocked front garage door which I am pretty sure is illegal. Outside I remained compliant but kept asking why I was in handcuffs. The guy cop then frisked me and touched my penis twice and after he did that I said ""you just touched my dick again"" and then he put his finger up my ass. I am serious. He degraded me in front of my entire neighborhood in broad daylight. 0 reason to. Then they put me in the backseat of a squad car and I kept asking why I was in a car in handcuffs and kept repeating I am not going to harm anyone and they said ""because you told us to fuck off like 20 times"" and ""we are doing what is your best interest"". Riiight, not rushing me to the hospital...? I think I might have been illegally detained because I did not commit a crime or make any threatening gestures and the sodomization was 100% illegal.Eventually they decided maybe the kid overdosing needs medical help so they had me get in the EMT, and they strapped me to a gurney. I have no idea why they did this because I was not fighting at all or acting like I was a danger. I kept asking and they would not give me an answer. Eventually I made it to the hospital. I had my blood drawn a total of five times. I waited in the ER for 5ish hours and then got sent up to the floor for people that attempt and act out and whatnot and it was AWFUL. Close second to jail, I assume. One room with nothing to do and nothing in it, shit food, a hallway leading to two TVs and a group room where you spend 2 hours a day max. No counselors, social workers are there but rarely see you (saw mine on the 5th day, was supposed to be every day), and a psychiatrist sees you every morning for only 5-10 mins.I told them that I was a prescribed Xanax addict over and over and over again and they would not give me my prescription to help with withdrawals. Withdrawals from Xanax and alcohol are extremely dangerous and can kill you. I had two seizures in there. They gave me Ativan after my first seizure ""well, just let us know if you have a seizure"" and for the next few days none of the nurses knew what was going on, or the psych. I kept telling them about my withdrawals and they said ""you are not going through withdrawals, it is a benzodiazepine, it is the same thing"". I was crying, I felt so defeated and that I would die in there. If you know how benzo W/Ds feel, you know what I am talking about. Severe psychological distress and physical pain. 3 days in I lost control of my arm, my back was arched and lost control of the muscles in my face. I could only whisper and this nurse laughed at me and walked away. She also told me my convulsing (felt like my back and neck were about to snap) was just a panic attack and I needed to relax. I had a seizure on the floor and the nurse said ""if you flop on the floor like that, I am not going to give you any benzos"".The patients were also traumatizing. It was awful. Just imagine a psych ward, it is just how you think it is. Met a pedophile, a violent methhead, a tiny meth girl who would masturbate on the phone all day, a couple fucking, violence between patients and security/police, emergency calls, etc. and yelling all the time. did not sleep more than 3 hours a night after I got a new doctor (because my psych forgot to see me one morning) and he was more or less like ""what the fuck are they doing?"". I want off Xanax so bad but it is so difficult to kick and I am so paranoid and anxious and this experience added a layer to my PTSD and my paranoia and anxiety are at an all time high. I am so afraid and I am even more depressed. The only good part is that I am coming up on 30 days sober. I feel like I was treated like an animal and I feel... I would usually use a lot of words, but I just feel like a robot. I do not know what to do... guys, be careful Guys be careful with the hotline and do not ever end up in a psych ward, even voluntarily",Depression
9893,"Depression sucks, I think we have all established that at this point. I want a hobby. There are so many things on my life that I get mildly interested in. I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now. Except my brain is so stupid. I feel so stupid, I cannot remember anything, or focus on anything for any amount of time. Not only that, but I am also terrified of saying something stupid, or looking like an idiot. To be fair to myself it takes years to learn a language, but I have such a thin skin right now. Yesterday I went for a walk around my neighborhood. It was actually the first time I walked around it in a long time. Nearing the end of it I got whacked in the face by a bee, jumped, swatted it. Right in front another person. I felt ridiculous, like I was swatting at nothing like a crazy person. Trying to save I face I remarked that ""I hate bees"" with an awkward laugh. She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day. And I keep thinking that I am never going to do it. I am worried about it being another regret in my life. I could have done it but never did. Just another causulty of my depression.I want to go on more hikes. I want a friend to do it with. I love walking but I do not like going on walks by myself. I am still nervous about it, and honestly it is better having someone there with you. I do not want to talk the entire time, but it would be nice to have company while strolling along and listening to music.Speaking of music. I have so many albums on backlog that I have not listened to yet. I want to listen to them, but I like listening to new albums the whole way through on the first go. So I save them until I am ""ready"" and ""have enough time to thoroughly enjoy them"", but that never happens even though a majority of my time is spend in my room doing nothing. I have not learned to drive yet. I have tried and I am scared. I feel like my anxiety is going to because me to over react and because an accident. it would be great to drive, then maybe I could go out and do things. But the thing is that not driving should not be holding me back this much. I do not need to drive where I live. Sure, it would make life easier, but there are plenty of busses or Ubers and even trains that I could take into the city if I wanted. But I do not. I go to work, I do some schoolwork, then I sleep and maybe I will eat if I am lucky while convincing myself that maybe next week things will change.My last semester of college is going be this fall and I feel like my entire world is crumbling because I do not know what I am going to do when it ends.I am overwhelmed, and I am bitter and irritable and angry and judgemental all of the time. And I am sick of this shit. I already regret my life, and I feel like in five years from now instead looking at younger me and saying ""everything will get better"" I will just be as resentful as I am right now. I want a hobby among other things.",Depression
9894,"I went to hospital trying to admit myself, with self harm. I got stitches and spoke to the first clinician, there were no beds in the mental health ward so they wanted me to stay the night to try again the next day. I did. I spoke to another clinician the next day who no matter how many times I reiterated I was not safe going home, sent home home again because of ""no beds."" I get that - but being such a danger can they not transfer hospitals?I cannot be alone because everytime I am I self harm. All I think about is overdosing. I was weaned off lexapro 20mg in 12 days and started on venlafexine 75mg which hospital added another 37.5mg too which is only on about dag 8 of now. I know it is likely the med swap, I have got a long history of self harm and suicide attempts though and I am afraid. One side of my brain KNOWS I need to stay alive and I deserve to live and have a life but the other is screaming at me to just give up because even the health system could not deem me worthy of saving... I do not know what to do when I have already reached out to professionals, family, friends... all my history is looking up what meds to OD on and the amounts needed and the risk of failing or what damage they leave behind should I do fail.... how do I stop this it is so loud :( I am 27, swapping meds, and the suicidal thoughts are overbaring.",Suicidal
9895,"I am eighteen and just recently had been kicked out of/moved out of my household with nowhere to go. I was at my highest point, hanging out with friends at six flags and enjoying my time. For the first time in a while, I was genuinely happy. It all vanished the moment my mothers boyfriend called to cuss me out/ mother refused to understand my pleas for respect. I know this seems minuscule, but imagine 18 years of a lack of empathy and emotional understanding. 18 years of your life without break. The toll it takes on a human? I have always been pushing back my suicide for another day, another year, for when life gets good. My biggest motivator in going on was the future. But that subtle reminder told me all I needed to know. I was set up for failure by those who were made to love me, the fact that I was never loved, done wrong multiple times, and there is no way of escaping it. No way of turning back the time. Even if I get rich, married, even live my dream life, Ill always be haunted by everything that is happened to me. Ill always be haunted by the fact that I have failed in some way...some aspect. I am fucked emotionally and while I forgive and love some of my family and the people in my life , I will never forget them for staring at a child in the face and deciding to allow what happened to them. To look at my blatant cries for help and turn a blind eye simply because it was not convenient for them. I do not want to wait for the good to happen because its always fleeting. Every time I am in a good place, wether it be 1 second or 1 year; Ill always have the eerie feeling that creeps up on me...reminding me that a traumatic and bad experience is just right around the corner waiting to strike. I cannot be happy without sadness wishing to steal the spotlight. Its hopeless and there is really nothing I can do about it. I do not want to live like this anymore. I do not want to grow old. I do not want to settle for a life of unhappiness just to prevent the temporary hurt of the few that care for me. Id rather bite the bullet and die now so I do not end up 45, wishing I had done it sooner, but being trapped because of those around me. I am young and relatively free so why not now? do not get me wrong, I love my close friends, my sisters, my father, maybe even my mother...but I think they will be okay with me being gone after the initial period of grief. I think my suicide would maybe even bring them closer/help them. I hope so. And if it does not then the blame is on me. I wish it was not this way, but it is.I am at a friend house currently and waiting to inevitably get dropped off at my mothers boyfriends house. When I am home Ill either turn around and run into oncoming traffic/jump off a high rise building. Or take a shitload of pills after getting yelled at for a final time so I can end up being one last inconvenience for my mother and her life. So those that traumatized me can watch me die and see the blood on their hands, and maybe finally Ill be heard. But that would be asking too much. I just want to die. I do not want to feel anymore. I will not have to feel anymore.To those reading and wishing to do the same. do not. Stay alive. Please have more care for yourself and do not end up like me. Take this as a cautionary tale. I love you all. Goodbye. Its Been Nice. I Love You All. Goodbye.",Suicidal
9896,"I have had depression for a long time. Actually I have cyclothymia with predominant depression. My longest depressive episode lasted eight years, and it started when I was 19. I did not even know what being happy was supposed to feel like. I was doing okay until the pandemic. But working in the ED has killed me. I cannot do it anymore. The job I used to love is now so stressful. I am getting in trouble at work for my interactions with others but I am hanging on by a wire. I feel so hopeless and like I wish I was dead so I did not have to feel this way (I am not going to hurt myself, I just feel so bad I do not want to feel bad anymore, but I am safe). I have been talking to my therapist and psychiatrist and we are changing my medications. I just do not feel like anything will help. The only time I was happy I was on a great medication and I had to go off it because of a horrible rare side effect. I had no choice and cannot go back on it. And my husband and I want a baby but how can we when I am like this? He is so wonderful at least. I have spent almost my entire adult life - a good 15+ years - like this.

9899,"I wanted to add something positive. I was depressed every day after high school till I was like 25 or 26. I could not make friends or get anywhere with women. I failed at pretty much everything. Eventually I came close to jumping off a five story ledge.Then I had a turnaround. A few days after the suicide attempt. I just got myself to realize I had a lot going for me. Most of my failures did not matter. Instead I needed to build on myself. Since then I have been very successful. Nothing is perfect. I would love to have some more success in relationships. But even when my relationship failed that did not set me back. I still worry a little about depression coming back but I stay busy trying to do everything I can go stay successful as that keeps me happy.I understand many of you are going through hell.

9907,"Ill preface this by saying: I have seen numerous psychiatrists, therapists, G.P.s, and have been through the wringer with my family doctor throwing anti-depressant/anti-anxiolytic prescriptions at me to see what sticks. Everything still feels the same no matter what med, new routine, holistic solution, etc. I am exhausted of living. So, in March of 2020, I attempted suicide. I lived alone in a nice apartment; I locked the door to my suite, flipped the security latch, taped a handwritten DNR sign in my living room, locked the door, and I took an uncountable amount of Clobazam (not Clonazepam, different drug), 100 Gravol pills, and at least 50 nighttime Benadryl pills. I got into bed and listened to Strict Machine by Goldfrapp. Then, a feeling Id never felt before I was done. I felt like Id finished life. It was so soothing. It also could have been the effects of the massive quantity of pills I took. My then-girlfriend called me, and we have a fine conversation. This is where I black out. She tells me days after my failed suicide attempt what happened. I was completely coherent, and then just stopped talking. This is when I passed out. Long story short (too late), I wake up two days later in intensive care. Tube in my throat to regulate breathing. Catheter definitely in. Guess my DNR did not work. My parents (who live four hours away) are sitting around me as I come to. Fast forward, I convince everyone I am not crazy and they say maybe you should go to our psych ward and I said no, I will get better care when I move back to the city. (I was living in a small city at the time). I get back to my apartment. My parents stay with me. COVID breaks out. A post-grad program I am studying announces that classes are over. I move back to the big city in my parents basement. My degree is mailed to me. I keep having the same conversations with people. I keep doing the wrong things. I continue to comply with the Ministry of Transportation to get my drivers license back. They keep sending me different forms to get my doctor to sign. My depression/anxiety stays the same. Covid has made the world weird for years just days after my suicide attempt. Am in purgatory? So much violence, greed, and narcissism in the world like I have never seen before. Every day I work my jobs, but money just comes and goes if Id never even made anything. Same conversations, ad nauseam. Am in hell? Am I in Sartres No Exit? Most days, I think I am in purgatory.

9908,"What can we say about the "" Unresponsive""? Do they leave us in the dirt because they have no answers? Do they leave us in the dirt because they are not capable of grasping what we are experiencing? Or are we turning their life upside down because we CHOOSE to explain to them what we are experiencing? Ghosting is the easiest thing to do when you want to avoid responsibility. So, what does that say about our counterparts.. the one's we vent to and supposedly trust but leave us in the dust.. What does that say about them.. they would rather experience ignorance than the truth. Our example leaves them render-less to what life is actually all about. it is easier to live your normal pathetic slave ridden life than it is to recognize that someone you care about is suffering and there is nothing they can do about it.. and that is why they ghost us.. not because they do not care.. but because they are inadequate, they are not the one's to solve our problems, we are.

9914,"I am a college student who is currently doing a summer of research. One thing I learned from the very first moment I entered college is that my brain completely shuts down if someone is not kind to me. If someone slightly disrespects me, or talks to me in a condescending way, or even does not say you are welcome after I say thank you, I get extreme depression and anxiety, and my brain shuts down to the point where I cannot even add one and one. I had an incident with my PI about five days ago. He was working in the chemical hood when I asked him if I could come in at 5:00 PM the next day because I had plans. He asked if I knew what to do tomorrow, and I told him not exactly. He then proceeded to tell me to write a two-page protocol with all the calculations as well as every step of the experiment calculations. When I asked him how to do the calculations, his response was ""figure it out"" in a very condescending way. This was my first time ever asking him if I could come in late, so I do not know why he was mad at me. I wanted to come in late because I wanted to shadow a physician during the day. The entire night after my interaction with him, I could not decide on either to cancel my shadowing appointment, or just go there and let my PI pissed. I spent a couple of hours watching a video of him doing the experiment to his work and wrote a three page report. I then emailed him another question, and he did not reply the whole night. He usually replies very quickly, but he did not this time. I was extremely anxious and had no one to talk to about it, so I could not even get a good night's sleep. In the morning time, after waiting for my friend who lives in a different country to pick up the phone, I told her everything and she told me to go to the research. I texted the physician I was supposed to shadow briefly explaining why I could not come, and he was very understanding. So after showering and all, I went to my research, and at around 10:00 AM, my PI emailed me saying that he could not come to lab until evening time. He did this after I emailed him a couple of hours later that I cancelled my plan, and that I was going to come to lab. He said that something happened in his biostatistics class (yeah he is a graduate student), so he cannot come in until the evening. So now I am sitting in the office after I cancelled my shadowing experience and not doing any lab work. There were multiple times I was tearing up. I could not call my family because they live in a different country. I was really pissed the whole day, and after such a long day, he comes in with his flip flops at 6:30 PM and starts doing a 10 minute thing to his research. The amount of anger, frustration and sadness I felt was unbearable. Now I have been feeling depressed the whole week and I cannot even do any work because of it. I literally cannot get myself to get out of bed and submit one thing one click away. I did not get out of my dorm the whole weekend and did not shower up until a few hours ago. People because me so much pain. Many people are nice, but do not have good hearts, and that hurts me the most. I want to grow out of this without losing faith in humanity. I want to be a loving person, but how can you love those who are difficult to love. How do I get emotionally resilient? I really need help. When will I grow up and handle my emotions?

Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior.

I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions? I feel guilty and frustrated all the time. My friends even tell me i am a clown for texting him. I know its not true. But after two years i am doubting myself.Thanks Please help me idk what to do",Depression

I bought a gun the other day just to see if I would have the stones to pull the trigger. I just graduated college and I cannot find a fucking job. I majored in a boring, same old, subject that I figured would get me a job but do not really enjoy. I wanted to write movies and songs about life but I have no path to get there. I think that it is time for me to go. My family is the only thing that gives me pause. I cried as I pet my dog today but he was happy as could be. Sometimes I wish I was just a brain-dead idiot who could happiness in just simply existing. I figure I should write letters to my friends to let them know why and that they are better without me. I do not matter in the grand scheme of things so why stay here for people to bitch about politics all the time and argue over ridiculous stuff. I cannot find love and doubt I ever will, no woman can love a man that hates himself, and hates living. I have come to accept this. Nothing matters. I never did and never will.

I literally brought this upon myself and it sucks. I mean, in high school, this is what I did. I boxed everyone out and only one person cared enough to stay. I thought I was happier then but no longer is it good for me. it is really just over. It really is. I burned those bridges and now I regret it but what am I going to do? I literally intentionally did it so it is not like it was not my fault. it is over with my friends. It sucks but it is.

I definitely deserve this. When you make bad choices you have to live with the consequences. But it makes me feel empty. Like I am a horrible person. Like all my trauma weighs heavily. I cannot help but call myself terrible. I cannot help but insult myself. What am I supposed to do? Nothing. I do nothing. I leave all these people behind and I try again like I always have. I will be hurt for a while but eventually a new group will take me in only for me to abandon it. The times of happiness are getting shorter. From 4 years to 2 to less than a year and I already messed up. it is over man. Why try anymore. All I do is hurt people. I deserve no sympathy. I deserve no kindness. Someone who acts like me deserves nothing good. Can I even blame them for treating me like this? No. I wished for this and it came true. Jump onto the next train and hope and pray that maybe this next time I will stop sabotaging my own happiness. How am I supposed to care? Quick answer, I am not. No one can care about me. it is just over. Again, not ending my own life. Never will. Just living in a void and it is staring back. No smirk, no smile, no frown. Just nothing.

And I really wish that all of that factual evidence depleted every ounce of sadness and depression and anger that I have built up in my body and soul. I am a 21-year-old black girl from European dissent I have three brothers and one sister. I am blessed enough to live in a two parent household with parents that guide and watch over me very closely. At nature I try to believe that I have a very strong personality and that I am a very strong person. But in the past couple of months I have never felt more of an urge to be suicidal or because harm to myself then I have in the past two years. From 19 to 21 has been a absolute horror. I have gone through so much emotional stress I am pretty sure that I am clinically depressed I have been dealing with it on my own for a very long time now. I know my mindset is very dangerous I am such a talented and strong and smart individual I often times get disappointed with myself for wanting to end my life. But my depression and sadness is so overwhelming at times no matter what people say things never get better. Not to mention my family does not necessarily see the reasons for my distress. So fixated on my ever gleaming future they seem to forget that I have been sitting in the same spot for the past two years depressed lonely I always wondered what it would be like to have sleeping problems but I guess now I know.

Having also withdrawn from a practicum program which I was in to become a teacher (withdrew due to receiving abuse from a supervisor; I have no more passion for teaching kids), I started 2020 with the hope that I can find a better career, a full-time 9-5 office job hopefully. Pandemic turned this all around. I only have a part-time job and self-employment gig. A good thing is that the employer likes my work and gives me more hours and responsibilities, but I am unsure if my job field is suitable for me in terms of income and stability. I do not even know the full reality of this job (adult education), since we have not gone back to an in-person setting yet. After I find out more, I can decide to go back to school to get more credentials. I tell myself, ""let us wait until September when we go back in person"" and ""let us wait until I successfully finish this project next year so I can leave a good impression,"" but I am 25, and I just feel so behind. Just so behind because at this age, I have not even decided my career, have no full-time job, and most of all, still live with my family. I feel like an adult baby. Since the job is remote, I am stuck at home most of the time. It is so boring but most of all, it utterly feels suffocating to be at home because I am left with my ruminating thoughts filled with self-resentment. I feel so guilty every time when I do my hobbies. I tell myself, ""A loser like me cannot waste time away enjoying hobbies."" After getting vaccinated, I have been doing day trips to escape the dullness of my home and rumination. However, these day trips are just temporary escapes, and I am back to 0 when I come back home. I desperately want to move out (I can afford a room rent with my income), but I just feel so lifeless insideafraid to try anything new. This is different from how I was last year when I was extremely busy. I have no motivation to do anything. After I finish work, I just lay on my bed and use social media that makes me feel worse. I have no energy to go for a walk, let alone do self-improvement. I tried to do CBT on my own but had no energy to continue. I tried to look for a low-cost counsellor, but counselling did not do miracles for me, and I feel hopeless. I just want to escape, but there is no escape. I feel trapped inside. Any advice on coping with this somehow? I have no outlet to discuss this with anyone, so at least it feels good to write it down here. tl;dr - Stuck at home with self-resentment due to my bleak career options. Still living with my family.

I was never sure why and still am not, but it is affected me all the same. I was born into a pretty poor family, my parents where under 20, mother was an artist and my father was a soldier. It was accidentally and they ended up splitting up due to the stress. My mum moved to a city in various houses, as she got into relationships with guys. Unfortunately my mum was poor, and had little help for taking care of me, so made a buisness so she could work from home to look after me. The partners she had where all very abusive To me and my mum. About this time school started for me. I had never played with other kids so just did not know how to act. The noise when I went in that classroom was fucking deafening. In my head I felt scared, and just starting crying. I could not control it. Was like that all my first year. Second year came and home life changed a bit but not for the better. My muk started to get very sick. She had very rare heart condition, schone's complex i think it is called. Causes her to have mini strokes and be very fatigued. Of course this kind of broke my mum a but, she was already pressured by all of it before the disease. I became her carer a little at home, getting her food and stuff. Not great but this year I made a friend, started playing with him all the time.

I challenged lifes values and looked into the void, and now i wish to have no part of life troubles. I wish i could erase myself. i want to free from the shackles of life.So much suffering for no reason. Over a million suicides per year. Cancer. Heart disease. Stroke. Diabetes. The list goes on forever, and for what? Nothing. To end up in the dirt, slowly eaten by bacteria and maggots. What a cruel joke.I wish i killed myself at 15. I truly do. Would have spared myself. I should have finished resident evil 4 for the last time, ate two chocolate donuts, jacked off and blew my brains out. I should have. Nothing was worth it. Like cioran said, you always kill yourself too late. He was right.I do not want to grow up,i do not want to be a productive member of this life cult. I do not want to be a so-called adult. I refuse all of this. I want out. Let me die. I refuse all the responsibilities that were FORCED upon me. I do not want a job. I do not want to pay taxes. I do not want any of this shit. Leave me alone or let me die.This is it. it is only going to get worse. is not it? I wish someone loved me. Maybe i would not think this way. I refuse to be an adult. i refuse all of this shit. I am not just another number in the machine. How dare my parents impose life upon me? Who gave them the right?Fuck humanity. Fuck life, the universe was a mistake.

9986,"I went out (further than my local store) for the first time in many years today. Ever before the pandemic I had not been out in a while due to depression and the increasingly massive weight gain it caused. For years i have been living and working in a small bedroom alone wearing the same pair of ripped leggins everyday. Recently I have been trying to diet and get out of my funk, and I thought I was ready to go out and enjoy the day! I made a special effort to dress properly and put on make-up etc. I knew I did not look GOOOD but I thought I was pretty innocuous, at least...but I could not even walk a few hundred metres without people making fun of me and mimicking my walk (waddle, I guess)It happened two separate times this morning and I have been crying ever since. Its pathetic....I thought I was getting better but today has just proved I am not, and likely will not without professional help which just is not coming. My mum (she is the one who came with me today, since I have no friends lol) called the mental health crisis team and my GP earlier today; both just kind of shrugged and said that thoughts and threats of suicide were not enough for them to intervene, I would have to try st first. Now my mum is frustrated because its 1AM and I am still sobbing! She said she is not going to spend time with me like this again because of my bad attitude which means I have absoloutely NOBODY Anyway I hope everyone else is doing better haha. Any tips on how to get through the night without waking my mum up crying again? What should have been a nice day made me realise its time to go",Suicidal
9987,"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me. My whole living situation has really taken its toll on my mental health. Waking up in the middle of the night to a small noise, and then panicking that the ceiling's collapsed is awful. The last contractor in here said ""do not be afraid if it falls, its light weight material"" which just prepped me for it actually falling. Anyway, the city inspector is filing a report, and hopefully this will be fixed soon. But I feel vulnerable/unsafe from the wetness/leaking/potential-definite mold growth, terrified about further damage, and so, if days/weeks/months from now, and I am not here----- hell, I know who is to blame. If I do it, it is my landlord/leasing agent's fault (that is you &lt;name&gt;)",Suicidal
9988,"So I met this girl on tinder 1 1/2 years . We became friends with benefits because as an attractive man I run into a lot of women who only likes me for my looks but breaks up with me because my depression is so bad. And to mention between us two I was the more attractive one and she leaned more towards average. I was 22 when we met and she was 18. I enjoyed her intelligence and could look past the obvious difference in attractiveness. She took the time to understand my mental health and stuck by me through my issues. I also help her with her family issues because her father was emotionally abusive and her mother is classified as psychotic but refuses help. As time went on we became increasingly involved with each other romantically and sexually which we both always consented to. My mother kicked me out so I wanted to get an apartment and she offered to be my roommate because she could not handle her father any longer. We finally got the apartment and it was like a dream come true we were always happy and barely argued and had more sex than we could even imagine. We adopted a kitten and I worked over night at Lowes as mst so I could barely stay awake to take care of the chores. And when I would be awake I would finally relax and play the Xbox for a little. She did not have a job and was paying rent with unemployment checks. Once unemployment ended I had to take care of the bills untill she could find a job 2 months later. I helped her start a tarot business and that brought in no where close to the amount required for rent. Though I still supported her even after also paying late fees. So when it comes to my depression and suicidal thoughts its random and the only way Id cope is by making music , gaming and smoking weed. Her grandpa caused me to lose my job because he would always drop me off late even though I was paying him . So I was coping with this failure with my usually vices while she finally was hired . But I did not get the same support I displayed for her when she did not have a job . Music was paying the rent until my song was stolen by bk the rula. So I was in the deepest void that I have ever been in because this apartment was my first attempt at independence. She usually took acid at least 3 times a month for meditative reasons and suggested that I should try it because someone said it helps with depression and self realization. I was skeptical so I did not take it until 2 months later. She planned on taking it at the same time so I finally consumed it. The problem is she did not take hers and went to bed. I did not know this and began feeling the effects. At first it was pleasant and gave me this feeling of joy and an unwavering arousal. But then things took a really bad turn . I owned color changing led lights and the walls felt like they were closing in on me. All i could think about was killing myself; nothing felt real thus convincing me that if I died nothing would matter or be concrete. I started punching myself and trying to rip out my hair. Then for some reason the flashing light got faster and increasingly vivid. I felt as if I was falling into my mattress while dying 1000 different ways in my mind but my thoughts felt like reality. Nothing existed but my sad scarred soul. I finally convinced my broken mind to get up and ask her for help . I was gripping the sheets trying to find something that felt real or I would have surely slit my own throat. Of course the feeling of arousal never left because that was the first reaction I received after consuming the substance. So her being the only woman I was intimate with I always felt comfort in her breasts and she has always consented prior to this incident. So for sum reason while under the influence I felt that her Boob was the most concrete thing in my reality so I held it while being the big spoon. She instantly told me to back off so I got up and left immediately feeling shame loneliness. I felt meaningless and was convinced that I was truly alone and should not exist. I lost my mind in my room until I passed out. The next morning I was finally coming down and was beyond traumatized. I spoke to her and explained what happened but all she could focus on is how she was traumatized from me holding her boob. I reminded her that we shared a bed every other day and that cuddling like that is a normal occurrence because we loved each other and pretty much was dating without a label. She finally seen it from my side and understood how scary it might have been for me. She held me and told me she was sorry and that she should have noticed what was going on.she offered to have sex to make me feel better but I declined because I am not into sexual pity. Also my depression has extremely increased since I have took the acid. The next morning I woke up and she was gone. She just abandoned the apartment and left me with the cat and half of my property was locked in her room. She did not come back until the last day and told everyone in my family and her friends that I sexually assaulted her. I was hurt and confused because I was left with a kitten and was losing my apartment that I worked so hard for. I paid for everything in there all she owned was a few things in her room. And to say I sexually assaulted her is a defamation to my image and character because I have never forced myself upon her .so I was angry , heart broken and betrayed so I attempted suicided by slicing down my wrist with a razor and the razor was pretty much half way lodged into my wrist . My mom found me before I could bleed out and rushed me to the er. When I got back home I got into the locked room grabbed all my things and sum evidence (her diary that she started when we first moved in) and left with my kitten. Till this day she will not talk to me and is telling people I sexually assaulted her . Am I in the wrong ? The experience in that room full of lights still replays in my head and haunts me to this day . My friend who was once raped twice in the Dominican Republic says that this situation does not count as sexual . Can anyone give me advice on how to cope or what should I say to her or if I should take legal action? This would have never happened if I did not believe her and took the acid as a cure for depression. I was stupid for being so nave but therapy does not work and I am not up to taking any man made medications anymore . I just wanted to feel normal for once but I ended up feeling worse than when i started.Sorry for any misspelling and grammatical errors. My fwb/roommate betrayed me and claims I sexually assaulted her but I do not think I did, and I still love her. This caused me to lose my first apartment.help!",Suicidal

I am not quite sure how to describe it, I guess it is just one of those things you know, like when you are in love, when you are hungry or just need the loo. I suppose the symptoms are easily identifiable: apathy, melancholy, depression, fatigue, lethargy, etc, but there is a less-medical term that I think describes it better: my light has gone out.Who I am does not really matter, though for completeness's sake my executive summary details are: 21 Male, 2nd Year Engineering student from South Africa, caucasian with Danish and English ancestry, single, always have been, probably on the spectrum, no friends anymore.I have buried my best and closest friend, and another four friends over the past five years. I have been wrongfully accused of a crime that I never committed, which took the system a year of intimidation, court rooms and sever depression and anxiety to determine that she had made it all up. I have been a victim of extortion, blackmail and cybercrimes, involving intimidation, fear and had no one to talk to. I am the eldest of three, and the eldest of my family's generation and link that keeps my stressed-out family together. I have felt the feeling of loving another, but never the feeling of it being mutual. I was once a happy child in a happy house with a dream of changing the world, and the aptitude to do it. But today, I do not see the point of it all. My friends are dead, the person I am in love with, and the only person I have every loved, does not feel the same way. I have horrors tormenting me each night that I cannot tell anyone about, I am half way through second year and I have only been on campus for four weeks before lockdown, I do not have much money, I have lost focus on studies altogether and I am only 21 years old.Perspective.

Luckily my girlfriend realized what was going on so she turned it off as soon as possible, and went into comforting mode (she is actually the best). Now that she went home, my head is filled with nothing but dark garbage again, and honestly I have not had this bad of an urge to sh in forever. I do not know if it is called a trauma, but is it normal for stuff to be this triggering? I know I will be fine in a few days, but it kind of upset me that it hit me so bad. Tl;dr, watched a movie, made me feel like crap for the first time in a year because of old memories, and I am not sure if it is normal. ""trauma"" hit me harder than I ever could imagine",Depression

I have wonderful grades, and I got into the program I wanted at a prestigious university. I have friends I am so grateful for. I have all these wonderful things, and yet all that seems to matter to me is how ugly I find myself, and how I will never find love or be loved because I am just not normal. I have internalized everything my sister taught me about myself as a child, about how much of an embarrassment I am because I do not act a certain way, or because I am just a fucking weirdo. I do not think my parents ever defended me; but now that she is messed with them, they have a problem with her.I cannot go a single day without reminding myself that I am repulsive, and ugly, and that no one will ever take me seriously or love me. I am not committing suicide right now because I do not know how to do it without inflicting too much pain.I feel like I know the way out of this, that it will and can get better, but I am not letting myself believe it. I am the only person not taking myself seriously, it seems. I feel so alone. No one knows this about me IRL. I want to die. I have been depressed and suffered so much from anxiety this past year. And no one knows, and no one is seeing it happen. And I do not know if I trust anyone to talk about it. I am so tired. Terrified and tired",Suicidal
10049,"when i was 13, i started having intense mental health issues. i realized i was hearing voices and i was brought to see a counselor that ended up not really helping. after that, i would bounce between multiple counselors, therapists, psychiatrists and i never found help.its only gotten worse over the last year. my physical health is declining very quickly, and no doctor knows what is happening. all i know is that having babies / getting pregnant will be next to impossible, and that is crushing to me, as having a child is what kept me alive for so long. and do not say that i can adopt. i know that. but everyone wants what they cannot have. and you do not need to find a silver lining for me. you would not tell a paralyzed person, well at least you have a wheelchair! my heart hurts. i do not want to be here anymore. i want to it all be over. after 7 years of fighting for survival, i feel like this is forever. why not kill myself now to get it over with??

10051,"I know the knee-jerk reaction is to call cops on people.To my utter detriment, I am 100% sane. There is scarcely any reason or legal grounds to hospitalise me against my will, save for the fact I have been (rightfully, and logically) suicidal for the past 13 or so years.All the cops do is offer disgustingly hollow platitudes, and then leave. Same for suicide hotlines, or therapists, or psych wards. Hot take, but therapy and medication do jack shit when your issues stem from mostly material conditions such as oppression, poverty, loneliness, and long-term (often systemic) abuse.Whenever I have a BPD meltdown - and that is very often - a lot of people opt to either ignore it, or call the authorities. Due to my background of abuse and lapses in memory, I will not trust a one-time ""it will be fine, you can talk to me!"". Alleged friends no longer commit to anything they promise or say in the heat of the suicidal crises. And I realise it is not an obligation. But I willingly subject myself to horrible shit to keep up to date with suicidal people again and again and again, never resting assured I miraculously saved them.Comfort takes time. it is a lost art. Love takes time. As does trust, and henceforth, anything meaningful. I say I do not have friends, having 400+ ""friends"" on FB, as it would be saying you have nutrition if you ate McD for every single meal ever. Comfort takes time. But dialling 112 and never saying a word is easy.What am I venting for then? A lament for the unlovable? Ode to the abandoned? Perhaps simply a reminder to take a long hard look at your real friendships. Check in with people. Pick out the ones you want to commit to, and go balls to the wall, because frankly, some people like me can be saved, but only with a lot of effort.Show up. We might object. Help up do the dishes. Bring groceries when you come. Organise things with solid dates and times. Be stern and uncompromising, but touch us with love when you go in for that awkward hug.There will be obstacles. I do not trust a soul in a 500 km radius, and then there is people I have unrequited feelings for, and then there is America. Distance is a bitch, but you will probably either drink or gamble that money anyway. Gods, please, just show up. I would have paid, for every single trip, I would have paid.But there was no comfort. In the end, there was no one. No easy fixes. So if you are reading this, odds are that you have someone you ought to show up for. Maybe even yourself. I only ever needed comfort, not cops",Suicidal
10059,"I am a (M35) who have been struggling with depression more or less my whole life.What I can remember, is that from the age of 9, I have been an extreme introvert that attempted suicide at many occasions but with the luck or bad luck based on how you look at it never succeeded.For many years I would not talk with people and had a temper that made people frightened and made some enjoy pushing my buttons until I snapped.Disappeared whole school-days and just sat at isolated places considering my options even trying to end it.First time was in a forested area outside my school age 9.Had a rope and decided ""it is time"".Trew it over a large branch and anchored it to another tree. Picked up some rocks to make a makeshift stool that I could stand on.Lost conciousness and woke up 10-15 minutes later with a bleeding wound above my eyebrow and an extrem headache, sore throat and a redness around my neck. The large branch had broken of and hit me in the head and my face got smashed against the rock I was standing on.Went back to school and said that I tripped and there was no need for a check-up.This is my strongest memory from my childhood and many year later it is still something that makes me sad, because no one cared where I was for 1,5 hour age 9.My parents never got told and I will never tell them because it even today would hurt them, my brother knows about that and some other tes as well.I struggled through school at all levels and never connected with anyone because I (according to myself) was ugly, stupid, uninteresting, mean, angry and a horrible person and I made myself that person for years knowing fully aware that I actually was loving, caring, thoughtful, kind and interested in other people's problems.Even after that I would not even try to make connections with other people feeling less than everybody else, still playing the role as the cocky self-important asshole I have made myself up to be.At age 28 i meet a wonderful woman that never gave up on learning to know the real me.She more or less forced herself onto me and I did not stop it because I actually wanted her to break down the wall I have for years built up around myself.She is the most important person in my life but I have had my down periods where I just cannot allow her to see me weak and the latest one I had was today.I am away from my family more or less 5-7 days a week and it hurts but I do it for them so we can afford to still live as we do.But today was painful, I told my oldest son ""dad is going to work"" and he just said ""Bye"" with me kneeling to get a hug and no hug was given.My youngest just waved and then continued with what he was doing and I was totally heartbroken.Walked out to my car with my wife after me and just started to cry feeling like a stranger that just visits the boys mom from time to time.did not allow my wife to touch me became cold towards her.Hated my job, hated life, hated my own existence a d just want my wife to divorce me so that she could be happy and the boys could have someone that is always present for them and not se stranger who comes to visit a day or to each week.As a person that only have my parent, brother and my own family in my circle of life it is hard to find any reason why I should not just fade away from my boys existence even though it selfish and hurtful not just to the boys and my wife but probably the end for me.This sucked and was totally stupid to write.Publish it but will be removed in another 30 minutes or sooner.

I wake up everyday and I go to the same old shitty part time minimum wage job. Everytime I try to crawl out of this pit of depression, I just fall right back down. I tried improving myself with school to try and get out of my shit job, but I cannot even study without being distracted and so now I am 3 weeks overdue on my homework with no desire to do homework anytime soon. I feel so guilty about it, but I cannot bring myself to sit down and learn. I am severely in debt because I am an impulse shopper, and I have never been in a relationship in the 24 years I have been alive on this shit hole, so I have no one to even share how I feel (not even family cares or understands what I am feeling either). I feel so trapped in my eternal depression cycle. There are so many things in my life that make me want to end my life, but the only thing that is keeping me here is my survival instinct. I hate it here.How come everyone else seems to have their shit together, but me? Why cannot I just be a normal functioning human with a normal brain?

Stress at work has been mounting up, and unfortunately my brain is wired so that if I do one thing wrong, then that must mean I cannot do anything right. I always thought its weird that I can look at those thoughts and realize they are false, but I cannot ever shake them. The lack of any friends or support group just means I have been internalizing and ruminating on all my negative emotions again, and for the past few weeks I have felt like I could break out in tears at any second. The loneliness I have in life is near crippling, but I do not want to complain any more about it on this board than I already have.Anyways, today I started playing an old game that I used to watch my parents play as a little kid (Tomb Raider II if anyone is curious) just for the nostalgia value, and something about it just hit me really hard. Just all these feelings came flooding back, memories of pure contentment and not having to worry about anything. Being surrounded by people that love me, and not having to be concerned about going to work tomorrow, or paying bills, or trying to save more money. I realized today that those days and feelings are gone, and they will not be coming back. I guess realizing that was my tipping point, because I have been crying off and on all day now. I am just so exhausted. I want to give up so badly but it would devastate my parents if I was gone. Can someone please just tell me things will be okay? Life is so awful right now and I am trying to be strong but it feels like I am fighting a losing battle..Sorry if this is disjointed or all over the place.

Now I might be kind of a worthless piece of shit but also I am not that bad. I do not get violent with people, I have never sexually assaulted or done something really fucked up to people.

Over the last two weeks, I have spent a lot of time just cleaning up my current apartment and throwing out stuff that I do not need or donating it if it is in good condition. The decluttering has lightened my mind so much. it is like someone has just lifted a huge weight off my head.I have lived here for the last 6 years, 4 of which I have spent in depression and honestly, I cannot wait to get out of this apartment in a couple of days (I move on Wednesday). I am feeling proud of myself for taking and executing this decision to move out (even though I did not need to, as everything was just fine with this apartment otherwise). It really is a much needed change that I am looking forward to. I hope the new apartment brings better luck and better mental health in my life. If you are depressed and feel stuck in a particular place, just try and move if you can.

10080,"Throwaway account because my partner follows my main account and it might be compromised too, for reasons I will explain soon.I am 33 and currently in living as an immigrant in a EU country, not my own (I hail from another continent), since 4 years or so with my fianc.I have health issues, both mental and physical, that prevent me from working since about 2 years ago (CPTSD, Clinical depression, burnout, chronic pain due to severe injuries I received), I do not really speak the language here that well, partly because it took me over a year to become ""fluent"" and then because covid happened and I went months without seeing other human other than cashiers at the market or my partner) so I lost a lot of proficiency.I am not saying he is a bad person or that he is isolating me, because he is been doing his best to take care of me. it is just... I have lost so much freedom here, I am unhappy and no one really takes my need for help seriously.I am not in contact with my family anymore because one of my parents is very dangerous, controlling and abused me since my childhood. Like most abusers this parent projects a great public persona and divided the rest of the family in a ""either you support my side or are against me"" so most of my family cut contact with me to prevent drama with my parent. This person has tried to stalk me and threaten me if I speak up on their abuse, to the point of finding people I worked with years ago and using them as messengers.As you might guess I became overprotective of my privacy, I functionally do not have much of a social media presence anymore, take pictures or even talk to former friends much. I also do not have friends here either.I know my parent has stalked and found most of my social media accounts and tried to find my addresses when I move to another place (no idea how they manage to do that but they have even found my landlord info twice in 6 years despite being in another country). Imagine how bad this person is that I moved continents just to get away from them.I have been trying to get therapy here, but my partner thinks it is unnecessary and an unneeded expense. I cannot get treatment for my chronic pain for the same reasons, I cannot even speak of pain killers without being treated like an addict in our house.I probably fucked up coming here and I probably should have never done so I do not have anyone, I do not have friends, or family or anyone that can help me, I have no place to call home or to return to, I just feel so alone and trapped and isolated and I miss human contact so much I do not remember the last time I spoke with another human that was not a cashier. I wish I could escape but where to? there is nowhere.I just keep hearing this voice in my head telling me that if I kill myself I will not have to hurt anymore and I will be able to rest.

10095,"I have wanted to share my problems since forever but never was brave enough. After scrolling reddit for so long, I decided I will share my story with you. This is quite long, and I want to cover everything...So, my mental problems started when I was 7 years old. In my life I never had a close friend or a family member (mostly because I am the oldest) who I can talk to or even spend time with. I was distanced in a village, far away from the town I was going to school. So my loneliness started in my early age.Whenever I was alone I would overthink: what is the point of this, why do we live, what happens after death, and so on... That made me really paranoid and serious person.it is good to say that my parents were always good to me and I never had a problem with them. We were not poor nor rich, we were just an average family.I will skip my primary school because in there nothing really happened.When I started going in high school, I distanced from people way more. I was spending most of my time sitting in front of my computer, alone. At some point I started getting scared of people and interactions with them. Alongside with social anxiety I started overthinking even more. That part of my life was the worst, it was rainy for almost 2 weeks and I was getting depressed more and more. Also in that period my cat died which led me to suicidal thoughts. Time passes and I was in the same condition.After some time my parents asked me why do I not go out with someone or at least go outside. I would always tell them that I am feeling good here alone and that I do not want to change anything (which is true, I really do not). Time passes and they were getting more concerned about me and my mental state. Out of nowhere, my dad told me he called a psychologist. I was very angry about that, but I did not have a choice. After 2 arrivals psychologist told me I am completely fine and that I just need to get a friend.Now this part of story gets really weird even for me, because I do not know what I was thinking at that time.So out of nowhere I just started to get emotional over anything. For example, getting ridiculed (idk if this is the word) on really hurt me, which never happened before. After a long speech with my parents, I told them that I do not want them to decide my life and leave me alone. They accepted that.After this long period I started having headaches, was eating not even 2 meals daily, and could not sleep. This is still going on and it is getting worse.

They broke up for 2 months around 2017, a little before her suicide attempt, then they resumed their relationship. He broke up with her yesterday and she tried to take her life. She called me crying and sobbing loudly from the hospital yesterday. She told me that she told him he did not want to be with her anymore. She basically crumbled. Her mom called me today and told me that she tried to take her life but they found her in time. I really dislike the boyfriend, if I am honest, I have never been a fan of him. Hes always seemed off to me, distant. But as her friend I always made the effort to support her decision to be with him. Right now she is still hospitalized and crying inconsolably.

I had night terrors about beeing burried alife. The appartement made me feel weird after some time and my life got to the bad side once I started living in the basement. I had no more drive doing anything, there was no energy or believe in myself. Just watching the internet. I barely had 2 friends that i saw maybe once or twice a month.But after one night terror where i dreamed I was stuck in my appartement for the rest of my life (I literally saw the windows dissapear and a stone wall behind them) I jumped out of bed and ran out of the door and stood naked in the staircase with my heart racing. I slowly realised it was a dream but there i stood there naked and thankfully no one saw me. So i just went back to bed. But the night terrors kept on comming. After a while i seemed to loose the skill of keeping track of the night terrors.I just barely woke up letting out a loud scream every night for a few month and went back to bed sometimes without realising what happened the next morning. But truth is no one could hear me screem down there in that ""hole"".This made me realise that I am in a prison and need to get out. I need to change something. I did therapy and after such a long time of having no job just sitting in front of my screen all day in the basement i finally found a job. And the appartement that i now live is on the top floor.What is so weird now i can finally see the world! I never saw humans in my basement appartement and now i can see people walk on the street! I can see the rain falling! I can see people sit together talking with each other. I was so isolated for such a long time i thought it is normal to be alone and just browing the web.I think now that I am 36 years old, i want to make more of my life now after so many years spent in isolation.

10119,"Last night I had nightmares about my girlfriend cheating on me. This is the first time this has ever happened. we are in a loving relationship and the sex is great. she is honestly the best thing in my life. The only ray of light in my hell hole of a life. I guess my subconscious thinks I should question even her because nothing In my life has ever worked out.Its no exaggeration to say that our house looks as bad as the house in fight club. The chimney has cracks going all up the sides. the bathroom is covered in mold that comes back every time you bleach the surfaces. The cabinets in the kitchen are dyed with a thick layer of tobacco tar; if we boil water, the condensation drips down the doors and leaves streaks. We scrubbed them for a whole day but it only got some of it. The carpet is stained yellow from my aunt's cat living alone in there for a few months after she died and my cousin would not come get her. Before moving in we rug doctored it and although the water was black when we were done, it is still a smelly disgusting living room. There is no insulation, in fact in some parts of the wall near the doors and windows you can see to the outside. Our power bill is about 270 dollars a month thanks to that. For the last two years I have been living in squaller because my parents found it convenient. My grandmother lives next door you see. And she has congestive heart failure. So it is best to have someone there. I love my grandmother so I do not mind but it does become a lot sometimes. More than I can balance with a job. My commute is an hour and the pay is garbage but I was just fired from my other job where I was a manager. I was manager for a month before a disgruntled employee who did not get that position threatened to sue the company for racism since I am white and she was black. My boss told me not to worry about it and then a week later ""offered an opportunity"" for me to step down. When I refused, I got the axe. To make matters worse I cannot trust my family to help me. In fact I hate them. My father beat the shit out of me when I was a kid, he even used a 2x4 on me once. My mom used that to manipulate me to do whatever she wanted because ""she was on my side"" and when I broke that off it became if I say no it means I am a bad person. Because she would only ask for things that SEEMED like they were in the best interest of others but just by coincidence she got exactly what she wanted out of the deal too.I have had conversations with them both before but they just do not register what the problem is. I can spell it out for them but nothing ever changes. I am 26 years old and my parents still control everything and every time I try to shake them, they use their financial leverage to shackle me back up. Every time I get a job that pays well to start saving up, I get dozens of calls a day about how my grandmother needs this or that or my sister's need something all of a sudden or she will call something on one of my accounts and if I do not do this very time consuming task I will lose my money or some shit like that. But then if I do not have a job, I get the same treatment trying to force some shitty 10 dollar an hour bullshit retail job on me. And that is where I am at. If this is all life has to offer, I do not want any part of it anymore. My life is not worth living.",Depression
10122,"I am not really sure what I am expecting from this, but it probably cannot do any harm.I (18M) have been depressed for a little under a year now and feeling suicidal on and off for most of that time. Recently, things have worsened and I have started cutting myself and I feel like I am on the edge of just killing myself. I have not really got much to feel depressed about on the surface, I live in a wealthy part of the UK, I have got a decent family and I was lucky to go to a good enough school and have opportunities. But that does not change how I feel, which is hopeless and pretty neglected. I have always been the quiet, reserved one and I have not minded that so much, I have always been fine with my own company, especially since I was bullied mercilessly as a child. People who know me well get more humour and jolliness than strangers, but almost nobody knows anything actually personal about me. Since I have always lived fairly far from town, I never really had the same friendships as everyone else, or the freedom to go out and make them, even in my teenage years. It has left me feeling lonely, especially since many friends over the years have simply abandoned me. Simply put, I never seem like anyone's first choice, my parents have always focused on my brothers more than me and my friends are not really there for me at all; they never have been. Not one of them has asked if I have been OK in the last year, despite my still spending time in groups with them. I have tried asking for help or support, but I never know how to say it. I have always been very good at hiding my own feelings and problems and been the one who listens, who solves other people's problems. ""Hey I am depressed and want to off myself, got any tips?"" is not the best conversation opener I have ever heard. I knew a friend who described the looks he got when his depression became evident to his friends - ""like a wounded animal"". He described how he felt everyone was permanently walking on eggshells around him. I do not want that for myself, especially not since I know that my parents would never let me out of their sight knowing I was suicidal.My boyfriend, well, where to start. I genuinely thought he was the one, stupid at my age as that sounds, I know. Everything had going so well, but I wonder if our relationship has stopped being healthy recently. He sometimes becomes argumentative and angry when we are texting about things, and criticises things about me, my life and my family. Some of it is quite fair, but the sheer hate and rage bordering on contempt I feel from him when he does this hurts me a lot. Most of the time he is sweet and funny and never angry in person, but the angry episodes online have become more frequent. I have tried standing up a little more for myself (which I find very difficult in general) or asking for him to be kinder with me, but nothing really changes. I am beginning to wonder if he is emotionally abusive or not, but it is hard for me to tell anything about anything at the moment while I have a lens of depression over everything I think. Resisting the cognitive distortion that he hates me like everyone else is already using a lot of my energy.To be honest, I could go on all night giving tired rants about this that and the other that is gone wrong in my life or that I hate about myself, but I will not bore you with all that. Suffice it to say, I have got no hope left and I am tired of going through the effort of living everyday. I hate that my reaction to anything bad happening now is the urge to cut myself, and I have been wishing for death every day for some time now. If everyone knew how much I was hurting they would probably treat me better but that is not really the point, is it.I have decided I will kill myself in 4 days, but I do not know how yet. I fear death, but I do not want to live any more.Thank you for reading if you got this far, I am sorry I wrote so much - it just sort of happened. I have had enough",Suicidal
10124,Recently I self sabotaged with a girl and we broke things off she was not interested in being with someone who needed reassurance bc of her ex and I get that. I have a job I hate so much I am mistreated and I am uncomfortable I work as a maintenance worker bc I have no real skills and at my job I just feel so unhappy and joyless. My home life I feel like I am ignored or I am a background character I do not feel like I matter I never did but lately its been really damaging. I push away friends bc they want to help and I know what I should do but its the same issue with the girl I am always looking for reassurance. I am at a point now where I am asking myself should I go on antidepressants?? Does it even matter ? Idk if life will ever get better or if Ill ever be happy so I am now considering suicide as it might be my only option and it might be the answer I ask myself should I kill myself? Maybe the afterlife is this perfect paradise no bullshit its a perfect place where nothing goes wrong .its worth the shot I think its time and I do not think there is any other option I think I am going to call out of work tomorrow and end it I am 95% sure Ill go through with it I think its my time I cannot go on and I do not want to I do not know if it gets better,Suicidal
10125,"I do not want to go into a lot of detail, I was wondering if maybe some of you know this feeling. Since I was a kid there was a string of deaths in my family and I have always had long periods of numbess or detachment, questioning reality sometimes at night, etc. I have had a death in my family recently and it is been worse than ever. People seem fake/empty and boring, causing me to avoid social activities even more. The worst is when I force myself to hang out with ""normal people"" talking/complaining about trivial things, I just want to get up and leave. Nothing brings joy or excitement because it feels ""off"".Death and the passing of time freak me out horribly and I begin to doubt anything even exists, maybe even my ""self"" is an artefact of some sort. I do not know what I like or who I am, I kind of stole personality traits and interests from other people, nothing feels real. Everything just freaks me out so badly that I kind of disconnect I guess. In a way I am grateful for the numbness as I fear ""waking up"". Beyond our everyday bullshit there is a great black void that I cannot wrap my brain around. Have you ever had this feeling and how do you cope with it? Everything feels fake",Depression
10129,"my boyfriend is constantly doing stuff for me or buying me flowers and dinner. meanwhile I feel like I do nothing for him. i put my everything into my last relationship and it drained me so I do not even feel like doing the cutsie little things like leaving him notes because my heart is so broken. And it is not because I am not ready for a relationship, it has been over 2 years. I usually get all excited when hr gets me stuff but recently it has been all too much because I do not feel like I deserve it. I do not deserve all he does for me and in my state of depression I have no idea how I can even begin to repay him. I have no idea how I can thank him because I am so broke and I am broken. Every time he does nice things now I just feel like the worst person ever and it makes me so upset that he gives me so much of himself when I am so broken and truly do not deserve it.

I have recently stopped working at Chipotle due to it being a toxic environment because of the managers screaming at the top of their lungs at me for small things so now I have no job again. My health anxiety is not helping either, getting the random spikes of adrenaline, weird pains in my arms, brain fog, chest pains, and other weird stuff. I barely made it out of highschool and I am constantly being asked about going to college or what I want to do for the future, but I do not know what I want to do, I have no motivation to do anything either.

10141,"Its been so long. So many years wasted laying in my bed avoiding everything. Because I do not belong in this world. If Id actually done something about it when I was younger it might have worked out better. But I got pushed to the back when my siblings needed special care for their needs. I pushed it all to the back of my mind so I would not be a burden if I asked for help. Ill do it later was always the way I looked at it. Deal with the feelings later. But now its a decade later and I still feel like I have not done anything to fix it. I have tried therapy, pills, mindfulness, all of the bullshit they tell you will help. Pills gave me worse feelings, therapy felt belittling and like I was just an issue they wanted out of the office, mindfulness does not work. My own psychiatrist does not even help. He pushes pills endlessly or tells me well stick to Zoloft for now, it seems to be working I am on half the dose I was on before, he even said abilify was not needed anymore. It is not working, doctor. I am tired of pills, therapists, appointments. I want it to stop. I have even started thinking about ECT. Just zap it back to normal. If its unfixable, just tell me already. Just tell me there is no fucking hope and let me leave. Stop giving me these false hopes. Its too hard to cope with. I am so angry with it all.

10157,"I have been in a relationship for 9 years with a woman I thought I was going to marry, nine years later I feel as she is the reason I feel like I want to end my life. over nine years we have been on and off mostly on but we have broken up 4 times in those years. Always because I could not deal with her undiagnosed bipolar. She had finally got diagnosed four years ago but refuses to take meds but last year she got pregnant with our second child her third. After she gave birth she decided she was going to take meds for her anxiety bc it could be a stresser to her bipolar issue did so for three months then she fell pregnant again with our third her fourth child and has been told to get off her meds. So for the past 13 weeks she had been off her meds and it has been extremely hard due to her bringing up things that have happened in our relationship over the years but she always brings them back up and last year when she was pregnant I screwed up more then I ever have and was talking to another woman thousands of miles away sexually. But have since realized I was wrong and I really do love this woman but for the past few months it has been very hard to not give in to my depression. She bully's me and tells me I am worthless and fat and lazy and I do not make enough I do not do enough I do not help enough I do not do enough for my kid I do not give her enough time to just do her. I get she is mad but last week she went four days of being nice and saying she hurt me as much as I hurt her so why continue and said she was done. And for the last five days she has been treating me like shit again but really attacking my depression and making sure I want to end my life then says no one cares you do not have anyone that cares about you. Idk what to do we have three kids and i have no one to go to or anywhere to crash for a few days and neither does she and it has been like that for our whole relationship so idk how to progress our relationship or my mental and I just keep going back to the things she says.

10166,"Hi all,I write this just because I need to let it out. Its a description of my current situation without the full story or details, otherwise it would be a very long post. Thanks to whoever will have the patience to read it.My family situation has always been precarious and I had little to none margin of error, but I have got everything wrong nonetheless. I am a 30 years old guy and I do not know how much time Ill have to live yet, but what I know is that whatever Ill do, Ill continue to fail.I hate my job because I am full of work, underpaid and I cannot stand my boss attitude and a few of my colleagues. I am always stressed, nervous, angry and sad. Id like to leave the job, but I developed a fear of driving and the public transport is a mess where I live in. Even if I could face my fear, I would not have the money to buy a car.However, Ill have an interview tomorrow. Its a 90 minutes commute of walk, bus and train, but if they take me and the salary is a bit better Ill accept it, because if I continue this way Ill explode of anger and leave my current job before finding another one. But I have low expectations.At home it is not better. My father abandoned me even before my birth. I barely ever had a good relationship with my mother. Probably she sees in me her disappointment with my father and other men. But I am not a psychologist, so that is just my theory. She is unemployed and over-indebted and we will loose my grandparents house in the next years. I loved my grandparents and I love this house. I tried anything I could to save it, but I failed.I have got no friends. I am an introverted guy with a need for solitude and I cannot physically and mentally bear a mundane life. Even when I had friends more like me, I always alienated them. But now I feel lonely and sad.At night I think and I cannot sleep. If I sleep, I have nightmares. Nothing good will happen and, even if it would, I would ruin it. Lately I am always sensitive and irascible and I am starting to have thoughts that I do not like.I am so tired of living and I just want to die.

10169,"This year has been a bit challenging emotionally. I am not really sure where to go with this as I hate burdening my loved ones with really unhappy things, so for now I am just going to yell into the void of Reddit so I can organize all my thoughts and get them out. In short: I am extremely unhappy with the person I seem to be recently. Its almost like I was a different person last year and even the year before that especially. I was happier. Everything was generally okay. Life felt good for the most part. And now, for the past 6 or 7 months or so, I have been largely a hot mess.It does not make much sense, because things are good right now. I should be happy. In December I moved into my own place with my partner who I love dearly, and everything between us is wonderful. We adopted a cat. I was able to find a job here in our new town right after moving. I have made acquaintances despite my horrible social anxiety. In theory, everything is *wonderful*. But for some reason, despite all that, I have spent the grand majority of this time going through cycles of misery. My self-esteem has hit an all time low, and that is saying something. I frequently put myself down. I feel like a failure despite my accomplishments. I have been crying almost daily, or at least several times a week. I seem to cry way more easily now, because I used to only cry every once in a while. I have many moments almost on the daily where I just feel very sad, angry, or grumpy. Sometimes my entire day will be ruined by one small thing and I will turn into an irritable unfun person for pretty much the rest of the day. I hate being this way. It cannot be fun for my loved ones, and its certainly not fun for me. I have been withdrawing from keeping in touch with friends, too. Deep down, I am afraid they secretly do not want to hear from me. I know how ridiculous that sounds but I cannot help thinking it.I am not sure if this is depression or what. I have struggled with anxiety and OCD since I was a child but I have never been to a psychologist about this specific issue. And now I am in a small town so access to in person therapy is rough to find. I am looking for telehealth options, but in the meantime I am unsure what to make of myself lately. Sometimes I worry I am just overreacting, but it cannot be okay to feel this way so consistently... right? Does this sound normal, or is it worth seeking help?",Depression
10170,"I tried to kill myself via overdose. It was stupid and even though Id been planning on doing it a few days it was terribly organised, desperate and last minute.

I honestly do not want to think like this but I am stuck in this rut I cannot get out of and I am not coping at all without thoughts of the future and how bleak and impossible everything looks. I have cut loads of people out and minimised contact for the past several years. I do not know if I have just been doing that because I want less people to hurt or it takes me too much energy or what. I do not feel I think too clearly about things like that. Sometimes it is easier having no one and keeping everything to yourself because people cannot be trusted. I feel worried about what will come of my failed suicide attempt.

10176,"Since I can remember I have always been a sad child on the inside. I blame it on my parents. Our relationship is not that great, although I believe they never realized it because they have been to absorbed in their own opinions. I feel as if they never really loved me, because they have always been lacking emotional support. I know they try in their own way and they are not bad people but I still resent them to this day for deciding to have children if they do not know how to care for them. If I was sad or had any kind of problems my parents would always dismiss them as ""childish and irrelevant"", ""that will not matter in 5 years anyway"", ""do not be so sensitive"", ""you are such a crybaby"". So I learned from an early age to deal with any kind of emotional needs and distress on my own. In elementary school I used to have a lot of friends and I always used to pride myself with being a good and reliable friend. So when one of my friends was cast out because of something that was out of her control I stood by her side. And I was the only one that did. When the others decided to forgive her I was stranded alone, left behind by the only friend I had. With the beginning of puberty I developed an eating disorder that to this day has gone unnoticed to my parents. I used to skip breakfast, throw away my lunch at school and only eat one meal when I would come home. I was really skinny, kind of underweight. I would lay in my bed at night and my stomach would hurt, screaming at me to get some food and I would just lay there and enjoy it, feeling accomplished. It was not even about weight or looks, people always told me I was too skinny. It was simply about control. The only person I could rely on and that I trusted was my cat. I loved her very much. She would always sleep on my bed nearly every night. On the outside I was always a very happy person, that might even be something I was known for.It took some time, a lot of third-weeling and always being put on the back-burner until I found the great friends that I now have and I am unbelievably thankful for them. They are my only support system - a support system that I build on my own. From then on things went good for once. I was in school nearly all day - away from by parents, could spend time with my friends, got good grades, my eating disorder got better. I was really happy those couple years of my life. The happiest I have ever been. And then my cat died. She was with me for 10 years and there has never been anyone I have loved more than her. With 17 I got my first boyfriend and I was very happy. I honestly think if my cat had not died I would have stayed single but I felt so lonely after that. Things got bad pretty quickly. It started with yelling and jealousy, controlling behaviour. I noticed it, but I was too weak to break up. I was already in too deep and hoped that it would get better with time. I had a lot of compassion and understanding for him because I knew he had a rough childhood and saw some serious stuff. But of course it only got worse from there. Those 1 1/2 years where torture. I was being manipulated into feeling like the bad guy, worthless even when I was the one being insulted, held against my will, pushed, beaten, threatend and even raped. I regularly had bruises that I hid successfully from everyone else. I really tried to help him but I realised that there was nothing I could do without endangering myself. At the end of our relationship I was seriously suicidal. My eating disorder got really bad and I was critically underweight. My parents of course did not notice that either. I mustered all my strenght to break up with him and filed a report to the police (only for assault because that was the only thing I had any kind of evidence for).My father drove me to the police. They were considerate for like a week until they acted like nothing happend after that. My mother complained that I did not want to go to a family reunion we had planned, like she did not find out her daughter was assaulted for months three days ago. After that she told me something that I will never forget. She told me how bad SHE was suffering after hearing what happend to me and how bad of a mother she felt now, all whilst never asking how I was doing or offering any help. I was doing better for a couple of months, being relieved that I am not in that relationship anymore. But it has been getting worse. I have diagnosed insomnia and anxiety, now maybe even depression. Pills have not been helping and therapy is taking way to long to show effects. I have panic attacks that feel like I am dying. My parents are also not considerate of that or take it into account when interacting with me whatsoever. The last month I had a rough patch where I started driking alcohol and taking my medication I ways that I should not. I realise now that there was one incident where I nearly could have died.I have been trying to move out because I just need to get away from here. Everything here reminds me of bad things in the past and I feel trapped. My parents want to buy an appartment for me - which sounds nice at first, but it is only in their interest. They do not want to pay money to rent, they want to earn money from the real estate and because nobody wants to sell we have been searching for months unsuccessfully. When I mentioned that a friend wanted to rent an apartment in the same city, around the same time and suggested we search together and split rents as roomates they threatend that I would need to sue them for the money that they would be legally obligated to pay me (where I live parents have to pay you money to live until you finish your degree). So as you see people in my life have always made it unnecessarily hard for me. I hope I can move out very soon or I will go insane. People made my life very hard - telling my story",Suicidal

This is the best it can and will get at the moment. I solved all the problems I had and now the only thing preventing me from being happy is me. My stupid disfunctional brain.

I have not really got friends and I have a strained relationship with my family. I have a partner of 7 years and everything was going fine but at some point everything fell apart.

I felt violated and humiliated. I went back to the you.K. for a month to try and get my head straight and decide whether to stay in the relationship.

But still I feel like I cannot go on, I cannot be in this pain any more. I feel like a failure and an idiot and I am completely broken. If I kick my boyfriend out who would want me? Who wants a depressed 30 year old who now probably cannot have children naturally and is in chronic pain. I am damaged goods. I want to not feel this way but I feel like there is no other option anymore. I have tried to get better but I cannot. I do not think I want to die, but I cannot see any other option anymore.

I have nothing going for me and nothing that makes me happy. I am a full time student and a full time employee when I am not in school. my entire life is surrounded by saving money and making enough money to afford college just so I can earn my phD. All I want to do is earn it so I can help people and have enough money to live comfortably.

I have no friends to seek help from or distract me. My family is extremely toxic and my father is borderline mentally abusive. I have 6 roommates at school who are very selfish and will throw you under a bus if it benefits them.

10233,"I mentioned to a close friend that I was dealing with a lot of anxiety and feeling really bad this week. I did not really expect their reply. It was along the lines of ""individual stuff does not matter right now, the world's in crisis."" - I was really hurt because it just felt like having my struggle belittled and also I was angry because I found it hard to believe that with the level of mental health awareness these days that someone could say something so off when it is not even like I often vent (first time in half a year I have even opened up) so I know I am not a burden. I got angry, told them, and then got sadder, told them that too. It started badly with them saying that I was taking offence at nothing, ended better - but i feel pathetic now, having to explicitly ask a close friend to treat me properly. This has set me off on a shame/depression spiral and I have been crying and cannot get out of bed since. Just feeling worse and worse, piling shame on top of shame. I have been good for months but my mental health feels totally derailed. do not know what I am asking really, just suffering and needed to vent. Triggering conversations with friends",Depression
10234,"Hello there! I am 18 and do not know what is going on with me. Sometimes I have a really bad mood and sometimes I am fine. This consists of a week or so of feeling bad about myself, hating me and basically everything I do. I do not find joy in almost anything and I feel empty and stuck in a ""dark void"". I feel like something is missing. Sometimes I just want to be lonely and sometimes I want to have friends around me. Music is also a big thing because it sort of detaches me from everything. At this age I need to find a path in my life, and seeing everyone around me already having dreams and going for a future career makes me feel useless. I do not know what to do with my life. Some days I feel infuriated about everything and everyone. Some days I do not. Some days I am just waiting for the night to come just so another day can start. have not felt suicidal or anything like that.Every single time when that feeling comes I become really careless about everything. do not fold my clothes anymore(for example). Everything is a mess to be exact. I do not have the energy to do and deal with anything.I feel lonely even tho I have friends, then everything comes back to normal. I can feel good again and can feel an inner peace again. Everything settles down for a moment and comes back to normal. have not spoke to anyone about this except a friend of mine.

10238,"I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past 10 years. For the past 3 years, it has caused me to struggle with anhedonia more regularly and it has been getting worse lately. I am in my mid-twenties and I already feel like I have missed out on so many experiences and opportunities in life, especially those that are fun. A lot of people have said I am too serious and I need to learn how to loosen up and let go. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to do that with alcohol or drugs. I am nervous that I might start increasing start relying on them to feel alive and have let loose. Recently, I started going to therapy and I have been wanting to go out and try something fun, but due to anhedonia, it is difficult for me to find something that is fun for me to do. I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either. My parents were helicopter-y and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okay/fun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame. I often find myself searching in Google what do people do for fun? to find out what other people who are not depressed find fun or fulfilling. Many of those activities do not resonate with me. What do you all think? What do people do for fun these days?",Depression
10240,"So to give a background of the situation my cousin is in, he is a 15 year old loner who lives in a household where in both the parents are very aggressive and are always under financial crisis as none of them earn. They basically run on financial support given by my granny. He is a very smart kid and i can say he is always loved more by the whole extended family for his smartness although i did not get along well with him during my childhood as he was always getting all the attention and not me, it was my immaturity to not understand that this was more out of empathy and not because i suck!He stays in a different city so me and my family usually meet together on holidays and festive occasions, he had gone very silent before four years itself. We just thought it is a sign of adolescence and he is just not interested in us. We had not met him for like more than a year because we were busy with our lives. Since the lockdown he turned worse and he had started showing various other signs like he used to laugh alone and cry alone, lack of appetite and etc. On consulting the doctor, he had ruled out saying that this is an issue of depression and something realted to neurology and asked him to be admitted immediately. That phase where he had gone under medication was very hard because he spoke with long pauses and had saliva drolling all over ( which was said because of the effect of medicines for the neurological issue) he was admitted in a hospital and there was a night where his pulse rate had gone very high because of which they had rushed to another hospital to get a CT scan done ( apparently the hospital did not even have a CT scan equipment). He was okay once his school started and he kept complaining about boredom and his loneliness (because he had no friends), the doctor had advised to stop the tablets he was taking ""for sleep"" (which i assume to be anxiety pills). His behaviour has taken a different turn now, from being like a tortoise in a she will to a more violent kind of behaviour and i just received a call saying he was about to beat up his mother. I am genuinely worried after hearing all this! I feel so angry about the lack of awareness of mental health in my country and him not having a right channel to help himself. I am going through issues of my own and am just worried wether this is more than depression and the doctors not looking in the angel where they suspect him of BIPOLAR DISORDER makes me even more anxious. I do not really trust the doctors treating him, my family does not agree with me! I really do not know what to do. To be frank I am just worried I might lose him! If there are any psychologist in this subreddit, please as to what you think he is going through and how can i help him! I have a cousin suffering from depression and i do not know how to help him",Depression
10242,"I had a really bad interaction with my psychologist. She was the first one I went to after a series of bad experiences with different psychologists. I was so afraid to see a new one because if I did and it went badly, it felt like there would be no hope left. But the day I decided to see her was the day after the closest I would ever come to suicide. It was after some emotional experiences that left me feeling like I could not go on anymore. I did not want to hurt my mom so I reached out for help. I saw this woman for nearly a year but recently her response to my suicidal thoughts was downright unprofessional and hurtful. She reprimanded me and told me to think about what my suicide would do to her. And she set up these ridiculous rules that any time I mentioned even a thought of suicide or self harm the first thing she would do is call my dad. Mind you I am in my 20s. She had no right to break my patient confidentiality like that. When I told her that if she set that rule, I just would not talk to her about such feelings which would make it much harder to reach out for help. She basically did not care. She was the first psychologist who did not dismiss my feelings. When I told her I felt so bad that I needed to be hospitalized, she sent me to a psychiatrist who was incredibly dismissive of my feelings and then made a change to my meds that included quitting the meds I would been on for 2 years in three days. I felt awful. And I felt like I lost all trust for that psychiatrist. This is not my first experience with mental health professionals and they have basically all been bad. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like I am at my rope's end. All I think about is death to the point where I feel unable to hold a normal conversation. It consumes me. I have no filter either so I feel like the only way to save others from hearing these awful thoughts is to stop talking to them. I feel alone. I feel like a burden. I know I am a burden. And I do not know if I want to live anymore. I do not know if I want help anymore if this is what help looks like. A bad experience with a psychologist",Depression
10243,I have been struggling a lot more than usual due to a lot of stress. I feel like my whole life is a mess. I have had no serious relationships in over 15 years and I still find myself constantly looking at my exs (yes from 15 years ago) social media pages. I am always financially struggling and feel like I am worth more dead than alive. Suicide is always in the back of my mind but its usually just a thought and not something I think I could ever act on. I am always stressed out over work and working excessive hours over the last few months. Working out has always been my way to cope but I have been unmotivated and more enticed by alcohol instead. I have some friends but I feel like they do not really like me and I constantly go over all of the things I say wondering if they talk about me if I say something stupid. I want to workout more and be more sociable but I do not know how to energize myself to do it. I was doing really well from Jan - April but after that I have just gone downhill. I was in therapy but I was doing so well that I did not need it anymore. I hate to go back with my tail between my legs like I failed.

10246,"Hello my name is thomas. I have been feeling weird kind of symptoms and I would like to have some help to get to know what is going on with me. My symptoms are bothering me and I would like to have some guidance on what to do and what they are. So basically about 2-3months ago I started having panick attacks. I was feeling anxious pretty much everyday. I was not happy with this pandemic, school and my friends. I was starting to feel down. Also, I would feel very anxious about my health. Every sensation in my body that was odd I would focus on it and react in a small stress. I would vegan to panick when I would get a panic attack even tho I knew it was that. I would still panic and wait. Also after my panic attacks I would feel weird odd symptoms the few following days. I would feel low on energy, chills and weird zaps in my head. Until one day, in may, I started being very irritated at everything and I would constantly get uncomfortable symptoms when I did daily activities like gym, go out with friends. I would feel very light sensitive, a tiny nausea some times and a lot of stress when I got odd symptoms. There would also be this feeling of fear and feeling down. Even tho I was with my girlfriend I constantly had this weird fear of living. I would think I would die any second when I would experience odd symptoms. Then In June it got worse. I was having anxiety symptoms and panic attacks almost everyday. I would say 5 time a week. I notice during the day I would get this sick feeling with all kinds of symptoms. Per exemple i would feel my body changing temperature, brain zaps, my heart beat felt irregular, I was getting very tired and feeling very drowsy. And then it escalated into a panic attack. But when it was in the evening I would feel completely normal and everything was fine. But I would start to think about why was I feeling that and trying to figure out what was going on with my brain and body. So I would worry and overthink. And the cycle would continue. Until one day the June 15, after having bad anxiety symptoms, I notice a numbness in my brain. Like I could not feel my emotions anymore. I was trying to feel happy, I know that I was happy, I was able to express it but I could not feel it. So I started panicking about that. As the days went by the panick attacks were slowly fading away, and when I was having one, I felt the physical sensations but my brain like did not care. I did not feel that adrenaline rush and that panic feeling. I cannot feel stress anymore. Its very hard to feel love, happy, satisfied. My pschyatrist prescribed me 25mg sertaline and said that that would help. I kept explaining her my symptoms and she was saying its all anxiety and seem like she did not care. I did a blood test, it came back fine. Right before I started the meditation, the numbness and my physical symptoms were very bad. I lost the feeling of hunger and fullness, the ability to feel tired, to feel heat, and to feel emotions. It felt like if my brain had a brick wall the seperates me from feeling my body. you can feel the empty feeling. Now I am on week 3 of sertaline and some symptoms calmed down. But I am still experiencing this numbness. I would wake up and feel like empty. I still get trouble feeling hunger and I get weird stools. I am still a bit worried on what is going on with my body. Can you help me re assure what I am having and teach me techniques to overcome this suffering please I would really appreciate it. I am sick of feeling like this MY STORY I am SICK OF THIS SOMEONE HELP",Depression
10249,"Monday through Friday I am fine. I have some hard days but for the most part, I do ok. Then the weekend comes and it is awful. I realize how lonely I really am. I realize how I have absolutely no one. I try to stay active, but I am just doing everything by myself. I try to invite people to do things but they already have plans. I have tried to go places to meet new people but I end up in places with absolutely no way to meet new people.I wanted a family, I wanted the warmth that comes with it. I loved having someone to love and care for. But I think if this is my default I would rather be alone. Maybe it is greedy of me to want someone in my life because it holds off the loneliness. If I cannot be happy alone doing everything on my own then maybe I do not deserve a partner or a family. I have talked to people and have dated but even that makes me feel lonely. Its not having people, I am just like this. I just do not feel like I belong in this world. I do not feel like there is a place for me here. I live in a big city and I cannot seem to find a place for me. There was one person who made me feel like I had a place in this world and I pushed them away.I am speaking to a therapist and am on medication. they are working as good as they can. I do notice a difference then before when I was not on them. At least now I just feel sad instead of suicidal. I have barely been able to go to the grocery store. I have barely been able to take care of tasks that need to be done. I just feel like I am existing. I am sure at some point this feeling will go away for a few weeks but then it will come back again. I hate being alone. I hate doing everything alone. I hate that even when I am with people doing things, I still feel alone. I think I just want to be alone and not plague anyone with my burdens",Depression
10255,"Grew up in an abusive household, constantly yelled, belittled, gaslit, hit, bullied all my life. I cannot remember the last time my eyes were not watery. I finally got out of an extremely abusive friendship with a narcissist, but i think he was a sociopath. I have been going through the motions, letting out all these feeling that i never acted on and ignored. And seeing things for the 1st time for what they really were. Since then, I have broken my bathroom window, almost cutting my knuckle off. A week later, i started hyperventilating to where i could not brreath. That was an interesting feeling. And then i went into a blind irrational stasis of sorts, idk what to call it and juat cut 13 lines in my arm. Kind of like a blind rage but not. I try to hide it but sometimes it gets seen and everyone just gives a judgy glare. I later went into a blind rage having flashbacks and broke the window in my car.

10260,"I am finding it really difficult to find both motivation and any sense of self-worth. I have been on furlough for over a year now, am in-between jobs, been through a difficult break-up that ended badly, at home I am often belittled by my mom (not always) and my cat is very ill. I am grateful for what I have, I know these issues are not at all unbearable for most, but I guess I am just weaker. I have barely any friends (none in my area) and the few friends that I do have are too busy for me, so I installed Bumble BFF and reinstalled Instagram to try to meet new people. It feels a bit pathetic only having one post on Instagram when everyone has dozens and I am alone in the photos as well. I have been trying to make friends where I live for the past 8 years and nothing. *I feel like I sound like a very irritating and miserable child but I really do not mean to, I am sorry.* I also used to go jogging but it is been too warm so I stopped. I also used to work out at home, but I do not feel comfortable at home most times. Asides from that, nothing really brings much sense of worth from me, I like singing but am not at all great at it, the same goes on with the rest of my hobbies. I bought this volleyball so that I and the person I was seeing could go play at some point in the park, but we never got to, and now it is deflated and always in the way.&amp;#x200B; Today I took a big (for me) step and played some dance games for a little bit and that helped pass the time as well as do a little bit of cardio.

I cannot eat, I can barely sleep, I literally just do everything I can to distract myself and try to pass the time. I have been heading off to bed at 9pm because there is simply nothing to do, there is no one to talk to, no messages, if I send any I would be ignored.

Sadly it is been 2 year on the 20th that I also lost her to a tragic health condition that stole her away. Last year I ended up coming off the deep end, being the first year I did not have her to be the ground I needed. This year does not feel much different. All I want to do is see his face again and hear her voice. I do not want to break down, I do not want this year to be like every other year but I already have not slept in days.

I remember wanting to die without knowing why, and tried to hurt myself this young. I still does not who the reason. Time passes and things went darker around me and In my family. I moved far away to escape, but I carried my depression with me since. I started hating the world more and more while working in retail to pay for my studies and my living. I was thinking ""If life is so violent and sad, why I should live it ? Life is useless"" and started thinking too deep about our world, the society we live in and I was making me more sad everytime. I tried everything I had to go back to the surface, but I drowned again last year. I went to hospital because I was letting myself dying more and more. I needed help, I needed someone taking my hand and finally helping me with all my sadness. I needed someone to listen..and I only got bad doctors and medecine, which makes me more and more sick. I am arriving at the point were I just do not know how to live anymore. I cannot count on someone for my health, I feel like I am missing years of my youth because I always had to take care of everything by myself to survive and I feel like people of my age are doing so much more things.

10273,"Its become pretty hard to sleep at night. Feeling as if my demons are watching over me and preventing the happiness that I used to feel. I sit and stare into myself, deeply with the mirror across from me. Realizing I am not the same person I used to be. Feeling as if I am lost and alonefeeling of desperation for that happiness I cannot even seem to remember. I cannot the control feelings that have been driving me crazy. The feelings that make me feel heavy, dark and lost. Almost as if my mind is unable to be cured from myself. I know it is all mental, all in my head and my own doingyet I cannot escape it. Almost as if I am torturing my own self for whatever lies below. I know there are people out there that have this same issue, plenty, yet why do I feel so alone? Why do I feel as if I cannot help myself. I am stronger than this and I know that yet why do I feel so weak? This will not be the end of me. So I must suffer or figure it out but I will not let it ever win. I will not be on of the many defeated. I will push on, keep motivated that there will be light at the end of the tunnel, that there will be that desired treasure we all have been craving. Many hide the shame associated with these feelings, myself included. Many do not know how I feel or how much it truly bothers me, but I will push on. I have shared to those that I know will support. I have found I am not alone after all. It does get better. I am doing much better now than I was months ago, let alone years ago. Maybe I have been looking at this all wrong? Maybe do not look for an escape, do not look for a way out, but to look for a way to cope. A way to look at the brighter side. A way to live in one with these demons, with these tortures and all as it is part of life. It is what we cast upon ourselves due to whatever we have going on. Whether it is our fault or not, we must coincide with these feelings and use them to power ourselves on. I will not lose, I will win this war. Anxiety",Depression
10278,"I am gay and I have never really had any struggle with my family and friends accepting this but I have always had a problem with myself because of it. I guess I could call it internalised homophobia. I was in straight relationships growing up, but would find a way to ease my thoughts of being gay by watching lesbian tv shows or shows with lesbian relationships. This meant that I would get overly attached with the characters and if they would break up or argue I would spiral into a depressive state that I would have to have therapy to help get back to a normal place. Now I am 21 and I have never had a gay relationship but I am openly gay and am finding ways to except that within myself. The problem is that I still fantasise about women I like in tv shows and the actresses that play them, but its not necessarily that I want to be with them, its that I want to be them. I start to change my lifestyle, my clothing and things like that to mimic how a certain character acts. I talk about them day in and day out and it drowns me with emotion. It has not always been fictional women either as in school I found myself obsessed with female members of staff to the point where Id get so depressed knowing I could never be them and part of me would confuse this feeling for being in love. Which is of course highly inappropriate. I just do not know how to stop being so emotionally attached to the point where I want to die because I am so overwhelmed with caring about people who do not know I exist.

10291,"i am 17 and i live in a shit 3rd world country in the middle east, my parents are hardworking, i love them a lot more than anything, i have a few friends that are like family to me, and i have a brother who is fucked in the head and keeps screaming and yelling when he has no job and fucks around, today he broke my room and started calling me names because i am fat, just because i drank his cola can or sth, i did not know that it belonged to him, and tbh the only time i feel comfort is woth my friends, they are the place i feel better and i feel belong with them, but they have families that love them and brothers/sisters that care about them, my mother has a low-danger/stage cancer, and I do not want her to feel worse mentally that is why i do not want to tell her anything about my mental health, and my father has already so many pressure in life so that goes for him too, i love them but I do not feel comfortable with them, our country is a shityard where dreams are demolished, the only reasons stopping me from killing myself are my parents, and my religion.i just do not know anymore i just cannot live like this, in my whole childhood i never felt normal i always thought about helping my parents and I did not buy nice thing or expensive shit like all my friends, and always wanted to help everybody that I did not even get to enjoy being a kid, i think anyone who lived a life like mine probably killed themselves already, I do not know what to do, there are local departments in hospitals about mental health in my country but I cannot go there without warning my parents and therefore putting pressure on them.i just want to feel normal for once, atleast in my adulthood. i need help",Suicidal
10292,"My family has given me so much, but also taken away so much more than that. I cannot even lie down on my bed in self-pity for thirty minutes without people shouting at each other, and then treating me like they are the only one with problems, and never allowing me the freedom to express my sorrows. My outer family probably thinks I am someone who has had life too easy, and honestly, they are probably right in many ways. I love most of my friends, but I can never talk to them about my personal life, because I have built a facade of being an emotionless goofball. Even moments where I stay quiet for more than five minutes are enough for people to assume something is not going right with me, so how can I ever tell them what is really going on?My co-workers think I am pleasant and nice, but probably assume my personality is non existent. I am in line to have terrific job prospects once I graduate, yet I could not care less. Even after a post-puberty transformation that makes me a fairly decent looking person, I have never had a girlfriend, largely due to the insecurities I have maintained through my puberty years, when I was flat out ugly. Dating sites have horrible response rates, and even if I feel like there is a good conversation going, I always end up getting ghosted.there is also the fact that I am non-binary and in the closet, but cannot see a reality where I am able to love this part of myself, have a loving partner embrace me for who I am, or accepted my by family.I feel incredibly silly even writing this, because of how much privilege I have had through my life. I do not think I will ever end up taking my own life, because I am too much of a coward, and it would crush everyone I know, yet no one knows anything about who I really am. Yet I think about it everyday... when I wake up, after work, when I am with my friends, going to bed, you name it. Seriously, why the hell do I have to exist? Just let me disappear",Suicidal

Knowing I was terrified she would leave me because everyone always abandons meFirst thing in the morning yesterday, less than a week after I moved in, she told me we were breaking up and I had to move out. I vomited from stress in her driveway as I packed the car but as with everything in my life I was alone. I will always be alone. I thought if I could just hold on until tomorrow, I would be okay. Just distract myself. But its tomorrow and it is not enough. I wish she would fucking killed me instead, rather than have someone I barely know leave me on my horrible mother's doorstep.

What is my life? I do not know what happened to me I used to be a happy healthy person when I was younger. But then as I got older things went downhill from there. did not get many friends in middle school. Got bullied many times and made fun of. Middle school was definitely one of the worst in my lifetime. My family made even worse on me. Mom, Dad, Brother almost everybody. Got called a fatty by my father and mother many times. Got called a fat cow by my brother. Got called a fucking idiot by my parents. Yeah that is cool. But what do they do to my brother? Nothing. Literally nothing. Hes my opposite of what I am. I am his shadow. Sometimes I feel like I am drowning in my own tears and my hurts every time I try to breathe. I even feel like my tias and tios like my brother and my other cousins more than me. I am just a piece of garbage left out on the counter. Everyday I wake up disappointed knowing I am going to have to live and see the same faces and words. Do I have depression? Idk at this point.

10308,"Hello everyone, i was reading a lot of your stories and i always wanted to post something but never did because i did not want to bother anyone and i felt that i did not deserved any attention.But in some extreme efforts to try to get better, i convinced myself to do it, so here i am.Since i Can remember, i always had a lot of depression phases 2/3 times a year, but i was at maximum a month. Unfortunately, i had a big trauma in 2017, an since then, I am depressed all day. I tried some medication in a short period of Time (2 months) but i could not recognize myself as i take it. I was miserable, could not do anything and when i realized i go panic attacks that made it worth. And even After that, when i tried to stop medication, i could not stop right away because of the weaning time. So now I am scared of that but i still feel, it is the only solution.I am followed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, so I am not on my own. Also, even if it is like carrying a Mountain, i made my life proper again. I start a formation in september in alternation, I am in a relationship and everything is going well, and he understands and help me with this, I am getting my driver license (which was hard to start because of traumatism younger) .... So it is really good ! But the more i try to move forward in life, the more i feel bad.My brain feels foggy, my heart hurts me everytime, i wake up everyday only wanting to end me and my day and i needs so much effort not to have any rewards. Everything is worst than before. I am doing sport every two days, I am forcing myself to have some sociabilisation, I am good looking, I am still clever.... But i cannot be happy and it feels like there is nothing i cannot do at this point. Even worse, people just tell me that they do not know why i feel so miserable while i got everything for me. I feel guilty not to be better, and it sadden me even more. it is an awful loop where I am in and .... I do not know how to just resist again and again, having less and less energy and being a hundreth of what i was ...Sorry for this long story, i really do not want to be a burden and i Hope that every people that come here just go better One step forward, two stepbacks",Depression
10310,I am a fraud but i like to think there is something wrong with me so maybe I am not but i know i am. i know i am. i make it all up in my head acting all sad when i can think rationally. I am toxic to people because they love me. and i guilt them when they are not there for me. years ago i cut myself many times to show people that I am sad. but i actually stay in the bathroom for hours to try and cut small cuts. i do not have the strength. I am just a fake. I am so done with myself but i know i cannot do it. coz i cannot. its all fake. i think I am suicidal but i cannot even kill myself. i cannot even hurt myself now. idk what to do I am too lazy to try but I am too weak to die. I am just standing still doing notthing. everythings empty. its all blank. idk its all confusing and messed up idk what to do. and i cannot even explain myself well. and i do not have anyone to talk to and idk i do not understand myself and idk if someone understands but I am just a fake finiding comfort and i do not deserve that because I am just faking everything i can think rationally so i should have no problem thinking and I am so horrible to people i do not dersever any comfort.you know in life stories where they tell you keep on trying and do hard work you are stronger even tho you have this disadvantages etc idk. like they try to encourage this person that have all the reasons in the world to be down. well that is not me. I am the one n those stories that are compared to trying hard guys that do nothing. the one who takes advantage of everything and try to act like a victim. I am the bad guy in stories that do not have resolve. the one people should bash on the internet and wish death on. that type of person. and now idk what to do. coz i do not have the strength to die.even tho i kno its better like that to just end it all I am fake.,Depression

I do not engage at all. I am robotic. By my wife and now get told that she is out of the relationship (again).she is been telling me that she wants a divorce since less than a month after our wedding. And has been saying it multiple times a week since then. I keep apologising for my mistakes (because she only wants out because I am not fulfilling her need) and try to do better than I was, but it keeps hurting.And now it feels like it is over again and I just want an easy way out that would be certain to end my life. I cannot tell her about this because if I say that I am thinking about killing myself then I am trying to trap her in the relationship and being abusive so I need to be quiet about everything.If I had a firearm of some kind I would easily use it because I know how easy it is to die from one and how quick and certain it is.

I just have to not be happy to get there. I do not want to suffer now so that I can maybe be happy someday. I feel so sick and tired of everything, which makes me lazy which makes me depressed because I am being lazy, which makes more lazy. it is an endless cycle of depression and abuse. what is the point?

10323,"I do not condone suicide, but I need to share something. It could be a long post. I have cerebral palsy. Not the severest, not the lightest case, but visible and affecting my movement. I cannot walk if there is no one to help me maintain balance. No cure for this AFAIK.My family never supported me emotionally regarding my disability. I have no supporting community in my real life. I am 26, so it is a little late for me to don my pink optimistic glasses on. My past is a fact. Lonely and full of bullying. Little to experience with significant others. I guess able-bodied people find me sexually unattractive. Given that even I could not see myself giving someone a chance if I strongly dislike their looks, I suppose some people work like that. I get the ""exercise/ do yoga or it is your fault"" plus the occasional ""or you will be reincarnated in a similar body"" very often. I tried rehabilitation, but the arduous process leads to nothing that could be deemed a motivating goal. My physiotherapist congratulates me upon being able to use my legs muscles to stand up from a chair. Awesome achievement indeed. I probably deserve a medal for that. If there was anything I could do to get closer to the ""standard"" of a sexy young male I guess I would do it. But nopez. Me training means me suffering in order to gain some basic abilities and it is not 100% even that would work as expected. This body is awful. So I expect I will either die alone or have to marry someone who is also undateable. Given my past traumas I think I would be a weird partner to be with anyway.I am otherwise somewhat successful, but that brings joy. Amidst all of this, I should have the motivation to work on my PhD, while living in one of the bad places to be disabled in (post-Soviet Eastern Europe). Mom does not want to immigrate, so I guess I am stuck here.Honestly, it is so bad that I cannot even kill myself. I wake up, day after day, trying my best to do my job and seem fine, while seeing literally every other person around me pursue the goal of a relationsip/ family or have one and attempt to be happy. Or all those people who seem happy. Family and relationships are the meaning of life unless one could be a monk.Seeing that I am not that much interested in Eastern Orthodox Christianity (or any Christian dogma in general) that is not an option either. Not that anyone cares. Life in society has ""accepted"" me as an observer who sacrifices their labour and gets a little money in return. And so the years shall go, it seems. I have waited for ""better days"" far too long. it is easier to dissmiss someone disabled.All I want is for this to end. I wish no hell nor paradise, just the ending of this. I have 0 control of how/ whether my death makes others suffer; my suffering makes them go away anyway. If there is any spiritual essence in me I would like that to serve its purpose or whatever the truth is.But I cannot bear all the suffering in utter loneliness. Giving all and getting little. Always doomed to being an outcast however strong my wish to simply belong. I wish euthanasia was legal, but alas. Sometimes suicide IS the only actual option",Depression
10325,"Hello everyone. I have been dealing with chronic back pain for the last 3 years and had surgery about 6 months ago for it. Unfortunately it did not help much with the pain and I am looking to go into another surgery. This injury has taken everything from me. I use to deal with all my anxiety and depression through physical activity and now I am unable to use it as a coping mechanism anymore. Suicide is always on my mind and I have already made a coupple pathedic attempts at ODing and cutting.Through trips to the hospital and psych ward I still have not been able to find the proper resources to help me mentally. I have been on and off medication for my depression but they just seem to make me more suicidal... like I said, physical activity was always the best outlet for me. I have tried the hotline many times and I find that this resource is very limited, the help you recieve is far from what your get from a real psychologist. I am hoping that once I get on disability more resources will become available to me.Throughout my disability I have not able to get disability payments from the government as my girlfriend had been looking after me. Unfortunately it is been a toxic and terrible relationship. She had came into the relationship with terrible insecurity issues derived from her previous relationship and things kind of came to a head when my back went out three years ago. I have been ridiculed and tormented for ""cheating"" while I am laying on the floor withering in pain barely able to do anything. I am now at a stage where I cannot take it anymore, she is out of the house, and I am now waiting for my disability payments to come through. In the mean time I am sure my landlord will understand that I cannot come up with rent on time, but I need money for my medications and food. A friend of mine started a fund raiser for me and I would love if any of you could help in any way. I really appreciate it.I am in a crisis mentally, physically, and financially.

Maybe that is why I was misdiagnosed with autism XD (or was I? I might never know) but that is besides the point.Now days, whenever I get intensely excited or happy, I notice it makes me want to cry. Like, I get brief flashes over stupid things like the book I am reading or a game. I get happy but its like I do not know what to do with it so I have the opposite reaction instead, like wanting to cry or literally forcing myself into a worse mood. Or, brief flashes of excitement that set off like a bomb in my head but sputter out within seconds. I know that sounds strange. Idk if its because I just do not know how to be happy or if I am afraid of it or what. I just do not *let* myself be excited or happy anymore. Maybe I am afraid that I am not enjoying the things I am excited about properly, so I just do not? Like that makes any fucking sense? Idk. Any of you have experiences with this?

I am stuck in a house I despise, to the point where I live in my bedroom cos it is my only ""safe"" area and cannot afford to repair or move because I only earn 7k a year as a cleaner. I have applied for endless jobs to try and improve, giving up on finding jobs relating to my degree (illustration and design), because the Northeast of England just does not have those kinds of opportunities. I work freelance, and have tried running an Etsy selling merchandise, but have been on a 2 year hiatus because I am slowly losing the will to see why.I have applied for so many jobs and constantly get rejections, my manager was kind enough to offer me receptionist shifts now and then. But even with that experience I am still not good enough. I recently dabbled in OF, not for money related reasons, but for some kind of self-love and confidence boost. I stopped because it felt pointless, even when earning a little. I also stream occasionally for fun, but I have even lost enjoyment from that. I am at a point where I just no longer want to exist. I have been in bed for days and feel a burden to my partner, who has been ever so kind to me. I feel like I do not deserve his help in all honestly. I tried ringing my doctor about some therapy, I was referred again to a UK company called Talking Changes, which were useless to me in the past. When I told my doctor this he just said well I cannot do anything else, so I never asked for help since, that was also 2 years ago.I tried talking to my parents about how I feel, and as I broke down crying, I was snapped at for being upset as it does not help anything and it is ""no use crying"". I just ended up driving home, whilst crying my eyes out. That was the last time I got out of bed, 4 days ago. I am not drinking anything, I am not eating, I just want to slowly shut down, because I see no end to this persistent hell. I never wanted a big fancy life, all I wanted was to be happy and content, to feel like I was worth at least something. All of my friends are making big achievements, getting big promotions, buying nice houses, even my bullies are achieving more. And I am just a loser like I always was. Just basic bitch me.

She said:"" When you think about an object in your room, it does not bother you, right? well try to have the same attitude towards those things that frustrate you"". You do not get angry about a ventilator in the corner of your room, you do not get angry about the wind.. etc.She also told me ""what does it concern you if someone is fake?"" which is interesting. it is true that it is not my problem that Bella Poarch is the way she is. Also I simply cannot change her, I do not even have enough money to buy a plane ticket to meet her, so what is the point in hating her? I feel like she makes the world worse and I dislike her for that, she does not contribute anything to the world and she is a millionair.I think it is fair to cast judgements, some things are bad and some things are good, but according to my therapist, there is a way to accept those things, be at peace with the world. A way of relating to things we think are bad without feeling the need to reject them, hate them, change them.

Or are you just telling yourself that so you can think that you are much greater than you already think you are? This is a classic defensive reaction when people realise that what they just said is incredibly dismissive and mean.Some of these people even claim they have depression and at the same time call suicidal people selfish (or ''more selfish'', my enw favourite).People are SO unable to see life through someone else's lens it is fucking disgusting.

Just because YOU are happy being alone does not mean that everyone can be. Just because you are happy with never being loved does not mean that everyone can feel the same. Just because you do not care that you are horrendously shit at conversation does not mean that everyone can accept it. Just because you are fine with being unfuckable does not mean everyone likes being it. Stop being so fucking arrogant and ignorant. Admitting these things does not mean that you are shit and that you should kill yourself. If you can deal with it, GOOD FUCKING JOB! No, seriously, I am glad that you are fine with yourself. But also seriously, GET OVER YOURSELF and stop FUCKING DISMISSING PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS AND SUFFERING. it is SO INFURIATING.Yeah I would kill myself if I could, BUT I cannot. I literally cannot get ANYTHING right in my life. I am too afraid to die. I just want to stop suffering. I am so sick and tired of not belonging anywhere. I am so sick and tired of being the universe's laughing stock. I am so sick and tired of being my parent's toy. I am so sick and tired of being shit at EVERYTHING I do no matter how hard I study or practice. it is completely fucking hopeless.I JUST do not IMPROVE.I talked to so many people I did not know at all and my ''SOCILAOIAILL SK)ILLZZZ''JUST NEVER GET FUCKING BETTER. I CANNOT IMPROVE. I CANNOT DO ANYTHING BY MYSELF. it is POINTLESS.I will just get drunk again. I finally know why my mother keeps doing it. Felt good the first time around and I might as well just do what my parents are doing. Second time I did not feel super happy like before but I also barely suffered because it numbs you nicely. it is not like anyone gives a shit. After all it is all just in my head right? Nothing is real. All of this must be a simulation... there is no other way... I cannot get the help I need and nobody, truly, gives a shit. My problems are just getting dismissed by everyone and I am led to believe that all the problems I am facing are hallucinations facilitated by my depression and it is driving me insane. Why is everyone trying to destroy me?",Depression
10349,"I do not know what I am trying to gain by writing this, but I have come to the point where it feels like killing myself would finally bring me calm and peace. I am a 34M, married, a father of a 1YO boy, with a stable job (albeit not the career I wanted at all), and despite all that, I have been fighting demons that I feel are now starting to overcome me. I have been an anxious, insecure, and depressed person most of my life. I have had dreams and aspirations, but somehow I have convinced myself that I do not deserve them or that I should just put them aside to help make sure my family\\wife would have a good life and a good career. Despite all that, I could lead a decent life, graduate high school, finish my military service as a combat medic successfully, and even get a Ba and M.A. However, ever since my son was born, I have been powerless against my anxieties. I feel like I cannot protect him from anything, be it a minor cold or something else. Like I am always waiting for something horrible to happen to him. Like many other kids, he was sick during his first year, and he still does now and then, but I feel like I cannot control it, cannot protect and that he will spiral out of control non-stop, coming in and out of illness I cannot defend or treat him against. it is gotten to the point where I feel like I am cursing him with my bad thoughts about his health, making him sick, because, as my wife says, ""Our thoughts make the reality we live in."" I feel like I am always prophesizing about another illness he will have, even though, thank god, he is a cure, happy and healthy baby (aside from the occasional colds and other shit little kids constantly get). Even though I know that most parents deal with this and tend to their children and move on, I feel like this is consuming me to the point where I am convinced that by dying, I will finally be free of this pain and anxiety and can finally be calm and maybe happy. I do not want to kill myself, but I am going back to thinking about it too often. I am afraid I might break very soon and leave my family without a father and with a huge scar. I cannot stand myself anymore. I need help, and I cannot seem to find solace anywhere. I do not want to leave my kid without a father, but I cannot live like this anymore.

He himself has refused to seek help. I have some questions regarding the hotline:How will they reach out to him?Do they track who calls? My lady also has depression but it has not flared, I do not want to be blacklisted in case they find nothing wrong with him and she needs me to call.What steps will they take if they determine he does have depression? I do not want it to affect his everyday life and his work because he does not really have anywhere to go.I can understand that this can be perceived as a sort of revenge or prank at him especially since he is my lady's ex, but I do have a soft spot for those with depression because I had a hard time overcoming it when it was big for me, and now that there are actually resources I would like to reach out so he can get the help that I never got.

10355,"I am sorry this is a terribly convoluted stream-of-consciousness sort of post.. Also I am really sorry if any of this is against tos... I have not been able to get to sleep normally in weeks and I am writing this at 6:20 in the morning when I have work in 8 hours and I am not even tired yet and that is a problem and I am panicking nowI'm turning 26 in a few days. In the US, this means I lose access to my parents' health insurance. I do not have employer health insurance and will not be able to go to the doctor anymore, let alone afford therapy or counseling.My current job at an arcade is filled with constant customer abuse, usually microaggressions about policies or prices or just dumb people not reading instructions on games, shitty looks and tones of voice and stuff like that which builds and builds until any particularly aggressive, attacking customer is automatically too much for me to handle, but if I in any way engage their shit behavior the onus is on me to ""disengage"" altogether. I never have any real backup from management, it is just constant abuse and then punishment/writeups if I get mad back at a customer for being blatantly mean or harassing. I am pretty sure I am at the end of my rope with the company, I think I may be receiving my final warning today, and I cannot stomach the thought of remaining in a retail environment anymore if I do get fired. I feel like I have hit my boiling point even with just that.My employer has dangled promotion in front of me for months now, which I have made known I *need* in order to continue having health insurance, or else I have to find other work. But I am 99% certain they are going to screw me over on that one. I have been looking for alternative places to work on the side, but it is just becoming clearer and clearer that my lack of a degree is constraining me to abusive retail environments and not much else. I feel genuinely like a drain on society, utterly replaceable.I cannot afford health insurance outside of my employer with the wages I am making currently, I am barely making my rent and car insurance as is. People have recommended government assistance but I have also heard that is a bad idea and i do not know who to believe, or if I would even qualify, and it is immensely stressing me out after dealing with the clustercuss of unemployment for the greater part of last year.I have tried applying at various places and have not really heard anything back. I cancelled my planned vacation in favor of attending the second round of interviews for a place I really hoped would hire me, and they went silent and I have no time left to keep waiting around. I am on the verge of just packing up and moving, but then I would lose access to my primary physician, and I am terrified of going homeless again like I was in 2014/15.My anxiety and stress are boiling over, i think this is a lower point than I was at in 2010 when i got checked into a ward. I know other people have it way harder than me overall, but I genuinely cannot think of a way to make my life actually worth living anymore, instead of a constant grinding to ""survive"". I know I am fortunate to have a job at all, I just cannot handle the abuse anymore. I keep wanting a way out and I am scaring myself that I may actually do it this time.... I do not have a plan, just keep having errant thoughts while I am driving to just go into a lake or off a cliff or stuff like that... I am scaring myself.. I am at my wit's end",Suicidal
10356,"it was a different day in a weird way, in an almost bad way. i saw someone explaining about once a person has mastered the art of acceptance, nothing can hurt them anymore. but that meant that the person had barely to almost no sympathy, i cannot see myself being like that especially to her. then later on i had a panic attack, i could not do anything it was a whole mess. the night was ruined. i was full of anger at myself, i was fully anguished. i accidentally showed that i was not doing well and was done with everything while talking to someone, i was terrified at what i had just done. my whole mind was a war zone, i was not thinking straight, this was the first time in a while i showed the emotion of not being able to handle it anymore to someone, i was scared because previous experiences especially with my ex did not end well, my heart was feeling every bit of nothing, just empty and shallow. but it did not end bad, i actually got a message about how much they cared about me, it made me feel a whole lot better but i still had to get because i felt as if i just embarrassed myself. in the middle of my heart tearing apart from the pain, it was nice. it was nice to even see that she would write its that much, yet alone she wrote me a paragraph about how much she cared about me. the past week I have been praying she would say something like that, I am so glad it happened because its still on my mind and its been almost 24 hours and i cannot get it off of my chest, its nice to see she cares so much. today_i hate how I am so late, I am the wrong person who was here at the right time once, but now the wrong person at the wrong time. almost as if i got the last piece of the cake, which was tiny compared to the other pieces. i hate how people ruined her experience and i cannot get a chance with her nor her full trust, but its how life goes; life is a whole lie. funny thing to mention she mentions how she likes girls and I am pretty sure its satire i think? but it does make me smile in a laughing matter but then i just realise that i really do not have any chances with her, I am just here. I have been unlucky my entire life leading up to this point, my dad hates me so much that I am not even hurt anymore when he says hurtful things to me its normal, my mum sometimes goes out of her conscience and supports him. but i feel so terrible, feel like a shitty son for hating them, and end up forgiving her and him, but then it happens all over again its a cycle of never ending pain. I have been unlucky for quite a while but if I am able to one day get her then ill be more than just satisfied, i just want to be her safe person. it would be a shame if i lost her to some other guy, even sadder if her jokes about her liking girls came true haha, but as long as that person can keep her happier than i ever could then ill be okay. i wish i could go back to the time when me and her first started talking, then till now, she is the most beautiful girl I have ever met, the most valuable smile and the most precious eyes, they were like gem stones but of an odd colour for a gem, i loved it so much when her eyes locked into mine, i was really floating. i messed up. i cannot make her happy and make her laugh like i used to be able to, I am losing the only bit of value to her that i ever had. i hope this nightmare ends one day, and i never wake up. i hope i get stuck between a nightmare ending and waking up, where I am waiting for nothing, just complete blank and am never able to make it out, my heart hurts more and more everyday, and I am too selfish taking care of myself and trying to heal that i cannot even help her. i not only wish to die but also feel like i deserve to. anyways, cya yesterday was a different day",Depression

And yet its not ending here, my bird is getting more and more sick and there is nothing i can do about it except wait until he dies or put him down. Its not that he is in a lot of pain or something, but he is getting weaker and weaker - i mean sure he already lived for a while and is just old... but its just too much for me especially bc i have to give away my other bird when my sick one died so she is not alone. I want the vest life for her and i already know where i can leave her to so that she can be happy without my other bird but... its just awful. Why is everything at once?

I am at my wits end.I am slowly seeing myself gaining more and more weight which is absolutely ruining my mental and physical health. I am too afraid to go outside in daylight because I am scared people I know will see I gained all of the weight back. Especially the people who used to bully me.

I know it is probably bullshit, but my brain internalized the fear of ""being in hell"" now and for over 9 months I have been feeling really sad and empty. Like even in nature where I usually used to feel well and happy, I now feel really down and I remember the ""what if I am in hell or what if God is evil"" and then I become even worse.

I hate them and wish I could never see them again. I NEVER felt safe around those people. My father was always quick to hit somebody and my mom did nothing when he choked slammed me then kicked me afterwards.SHE WAS RIGHT FUCKING THERE! When I asked why she just let it happened,she just said that I needed to behave properly. I guess that she wanted us to know how it felt to get hit by him like that. She always let him hit her all the time because she was too stupid and coward to kick his ass out. Nobody better tell me some stupid shit about loving your parents unconditionally because they did not love me that way. They could not even protect me. They betrayed me. I owe them nothing,absolutely nothing at all. Anytime I went to them when I needed them they blamed me instead of trying to help.At this point in my life,he abandoned us. But before he did,he had two outside kids with two different women and went with one of the women. And he dares to demand affection and understanding from us. And that is not even the good part.

10367,"Just a few years ago I was 100% sure I had some form of brain cancer or a serious disability. I was clumsy, had minimal motor skills, among other things that affected me physically. I was unable to perform simple mathematichal tasks, my ability to think logically was almost gone, I had trouble understanding what I read. I felt so so stupid. My social life crumbled due to poor social skills. I was also almost sure I was in the spectrum because of this. I felt like a 5 year old in a 22 year olds body. I have had a spiral of depression since I was 14. I did the mistake of googling the effects of what years of untreated depression does to the brain. It was possible that I could lose my cognitive abilities forever. The chance of me getting my brain functioning normally was now only half. It was the first time I thought about taking my own life. There was not supposed to be a future for me. But I new what happens to people who do not go can ask for help. I did not want to die. Turns out, it was not scary at all. Getting help. At first it was a school psychologist, then a doctor, then therapy. In therapy they made me do all kinds of test that included evaluation of cognitive abilities and things related. All test results were below average, some were far away from average. I was mortified. I found out I have ADD and depression made it so much worse, hence me believing I have brain cancer. Due to right kind of support and therapy I am strarting to gain what I lost over the years. It took a while but I finally feel I am able to have a job or go to school allthough it still feels absolutely terrifying but I am currently at a job I like and I am actually good at it. I have a wonderful loving husband, a home I feel safe in, a social life, I am able to enjoy things and feel sincere joy regardless of everyday struggles I have. It was so much worth it to get help.

She feels the exact same way towards me.. in a way. She got out of a relationship this past May and long story short, she wanted to stay as friends because we just were not on the same level. she is just not ready for anything despite the feelings she has for me.

Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me.

Not only are two of these conditions considered rare, but they are underfunded by a society that does not give a fuck about unhealthy people. And then you see it on the news, two billionaires using money for flying out to space for shits n giggles. Leaving you behind. Which only results in demoralization that people like that can exist while everyday you wake up looking into a mirror as a broken husk. Ending my life would be a genuine blessing. I have given up on both myself and society as a whole. Just fuck this shitstain world. God is wanting me to suffer, my life is literally a nightmare",Suicidal

I have been dealing with social anxiety, others may find it easy to go out to work, but not for me. it is really stressful whenever I think about going out to work. Even if I have a job, I find it meaningless too, to wake up at 7am for a 9am job, reaches home at 7pm, only a few hours left to do my stuff and then sleeping early cos you got to get up early next day again, that goes on for the rest of my life which I do not like it at all. I tried to sell some stuff online to support myself financially, but that is not working out. Now that our breadwinner has passed on, we are left with a huge debt for housing loan, and also suffering from monthly utilities bills. Family and relatives only tell me to go out to work so that I can have an income to support the family. Others look down on me. Since I am so useless, I am slowly losing my will to live. I just want to leave and go to a happier world. Slowly losing my will to survive, do I have anymore reasons to live on?",Suicidal
10394,"I am first generation. My parents stayed together because of religious reasons, but there was a lot of emotional and physical abuse. Typical I think a lot of first gen suffer like this. Now as an adult I am having trouble being emotionally stable, I feel helpless at these feelings, and depression takes over. I know I cannot change the past, but now I have difficulties making adult friends, because I was so limited, I was not allowed to have friends over, My parents fought with family so even family connection was limited. My dad was always angry if I came out of my room he was yelling at how useless I was, so now I realize Idk how to be with people. People think I am so weird. I am so tiered of having such a hard time at being human, I crave emotional connection and I do not have it. I used to think of everything so religiously because that was embedded into me, now I am always doubting if god exist and if life is pointless. Its hard to stay positive, idk what to do with my life and if I do not do anything doctorly I am a failure to my parents. What is up with foreign parents wanting all their kids to be doctors? I started therapy its been 3 sessions and right away she wanted to put me on antidepressants, and I tried it, I had the worst idk what to call it, I started taking the anti depressants and I am like, why is life? I should just die. And I was sleepy all the time, so I stopped, I do not want anti depressants I need something and idk what. This is a desperate late night vent, thanks for reading.

10402,"So, I have been in these forums trying to help as much as I can, while battling this mo*fo* depression. it is been a year of fight. Some goods days, most bad days. But something in me always told me to keep fighting. That something has burned out. I can feel a new depth of hollowness in me. I am assured there is no more love life for me. Best part, the woman I love, she met someone. And I think he is good for her. I have not seen her happy for so long. And I do not want to destroy her life too. In movies we see the hero, throwing away everything to confess his love, but in real life, I have nothing to begin with, to throw away. I do not have any money, lost my business, seperated from my wife, who I wish is happy. So you see, there is nothing more for me. I have done my part in this world. Only thing to do is, disappear. I just want to vanish from this world as soon as possible. If anyone can help me, let me know. Just a fast death. that is the only thing I genuinely genuinely wish for me. Getting off Reddit.

I find no joy in anything, I have been depressed for 14 years, I have seen doctors, counsellors, taken medication but in the end I feel as though this horror will never leave. I have 1 good friend who does not live near me anymore and I find it difficult to make good friends. I go about my life like everything is great and everyone I meet thinks I am doing just fine except I am not. I try to find new things to do but nothing interests me.

10408,"Hi, this is a new account I made just to say this. I have been suffering from depression for a while and that has caused me so many things, I have almost commited suicide before, I have gotten an F, a few W's and Incompletes in college but somehow I managed to survive.On top of my problems, there is a lot going on in my life. I am doing a (summer) college class for the 3rd time and a few days into it, my good friend unexpectedly died. I have a midterm tomorrow which is 30% of my grade and because of this horrible news, I have been depressed, unable to function and I have to make up 10 two hour lectures for the midterm tomorrow. On top of this, due to the pandemic, my father has lost his job and we are about to sell my house because we need the money.The thing is, I have a loving and supportive family, my friends really care about me and I know a lot of people will be affected if I am not here. All I can think about is how to I die and not make it look like I committed suicide. I feel really alone even though I know that there are so many people who care. But I still called my friend because I needed warmth? but I just could not tell him what was wrong with me so I just hung up. I spend most of my time in my room and when I go out of it, I put on a smile in front of my parents but I feel like I have the world on my shoulders. There was a time where I used to tell my really close friends everything, including stuff like this, but for a while I have stopped doing that. I was just listening to music and sobbing. I have had weeky therapy for over 6 months but it just is not working. With my last therapist, I was in such a state also, and I told her what I was feeling, and she told my father what I told her and I felt so hurt by it. So here I am today, feeling the same things but I am unable to tell my current therapist how I am feeling because I am scared that she will tell my parents.Sorry if this is too long and too heavy for whoever is reading this. I just typed what was in my head. I do not want to give up, I just feel so much pain for so long and nothing has helped. I posted this on another subreddit, I did not know this subreddit exists so I deleted that post and posted it here. A cry for help...",Suicidal
10410,"Hi all,I have had depression since I was a kid. I have a long family history of bipolar, borderline. It was talked about and my parents have mental health issues, but the only thing I was ever treated for is ADHD.In the past, I used to have pretty bad GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and had a lot of panic attacks. I would also have some really severe points of depression where I was pretty debilitated for 1-2 weeks, but I have found for the most part my more severe points of anxiety/depression have diminished.I do have some substance issues, mainly drinking which is not a daily thing but once i start i cannot stop, just heavy binge drinking. I did used to use quite a bit of c\*ke which was a big personal and financial issue, but I have curbed that for the most part. A few of my friends actually had an intervention with me about my drinking, when I get past the point of no return with alcohol I get extremely depressive and just talk about dark stuff in my past and just want to take any and all drugs. My friends were basically like every time you drink you do this and its too much for us etc, we cannot deal w this and you need to stop. so severer depression recently has manifested itself more in substances than in my day to day.however, my day to day is meaningless and empty. I do well at work because its the one thing I am a perfectionist about, but the way I live is so depressing. I have nothing to look forward to, I wake up, go to work, go home, watch tv, sleep. Sometimes have friends over for drinks.I cannot take care of myself, I can barely maintain personal hygiene like showering or doing laundry, i have garbage all over my apartment. I have no energy or motivation to do anything. Something traumatic happened to me about 5 years ago, since then I have gained 100 pounds just with binge eating.I cannot even look at myself in the mirror, let people take photos of me. Before I had insecurities, but I still wanted to be seen. My friends do not even invite me out for day activities because on my days off I am in bed till like 5pm.I am an artist, that is the only thing i care about. i have not been able to make work in almost 2 years because the burden of it feels like too much. I feel like a fraud, like i do not even know where to start.I am not majorly depressed right now, I have been there where all I want is to die, but its more just like day in and day out meaninglessness. I dissociate a lot, always going through the motions and i feel like I am wasting my life.I am really uncomfortable with doctors, i have not been to one since 2012 lol because of a bad experience. Overall though I can barely take care of myself so scheduling appointments is something I have been delaying for years.but for those in a similar situationon antidepressants, ssris etc -has this helped you deal with the day to day? I know i should make a lifestyle change and put more effort into being happier, but it just feels so daunting. I am wondering if beginning with a prescription will get me to the point where i can begin to address the areas of my life i need to work on. pls share your medication experience/how it impacted you! i feel like its the only way for me to get somewhere because i feel like I have been completely stagnant. will antidepressants help me, or do i need to make a lifestyle change?",Depression

I cannot possibly talk to them or Ill come off as desperate or even manipulative, and I do not want to look like even more of a pathetic fucking failure to the people I love. I cannot even sleep because I keep myself up at night. I just want to end it all, but I am too much of a failure to even get that right. Id planned it out a few months back, and part of me wishes I stuck to it. The worst part is I know Ill be back to normal for a few days, hate myself for overreacting, and then it will hit me again. I just want to die so my friends will not have to deal with me and my constant worries. I do not want to burden them, but at the same time I am too selfish to actually end things. I do not even know how I feel most of the time, but even if I did I cannot talk to my friends about it in fear of feeling like even more of a waste of space.

This sweet man even offered to get a second job so I would not have to work. But I could not do that to him. I want to be better. it is just so hard. My training ended last week and today I am going into calls. To add to the stress and anxiety, my training was not very good. I have no idea what I am doing. I have panic attacks and cry every day and going into calls is going to make it worse. I have always struggled with suicidal thoughts but today is one of the worst days. I cannot sleep. I can only think about how much I want to die. I keep thinking if I just end it now, I do not have to deal with work. It would be so much easier. The only thing that is been keeping me grounded this year is my dog, and she only does so much to keep me level-headed. I want to quit. I do not want to go in. I really think this job will kill me. I cannot even afford therapy. And I will not get insurance until my 60 day mark. What should I do? I quit my last job (also customer service) because it was wearing on my mental health and I could not handle it anymore. I just want to be happy. But one second I am totally fine. I have come to terms with this and I have convinced myself it will be okay. The next I am a bawling mess and having a panic attack and wanting to end it all. People always say ""it gets better"" but that is such a load of bull. My life has consistently been shit. I do not need to love my job. I just do not want to hate it this much. I do not want it to destroy me. I cannot get the help I desperately need and I am not alright. Has anyone else been in this situation? Did anything help? What did you do?

So I guess I could be a activist for children rights. But to be honest. Do I really care? I am not special. Like every other human I just crave attention, validation, Love... But that black hole inside me... Can it be filled up? I do not think so. I am also vegan. But do I really care about the animals? This world is so fake. Fridays for future? HAHA. Fridays for self glorification and flexing. You faggots keep smoking, eating meat, be proud for being vegeterian (hahahaha, milk industry is even more cruel than meat industry). I hate students.

10435,"Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that.

People around me think I am doing okay and each time I reach out to my friends, they end up comparing my problems to others who are even less fortunate. that is not how it works tho, its a bad idea to compare peoples problems, it makes one feel unheard and neglected.Anywho, I feel like I am tired with life, some people are fighters, good for them, some are just losers like me who call it a life when thrown dilemmas and difficulties at. Its not like my problems are not solvable, its just that I am in a bad position rn and I do not think I can deal with this for the next 60-70 years of my life. I am in huge student debt (about to be, I am 18), my startup is going to fail probably (yet again because no one wants to invest in anything that does not inspire confidence), my love life is a dry land because I never have enough time and when I do, I just deal with disappointments. I am sorry if this got drifted away from the title.So yes, the title, I have planned the next step once and for all, I am not doing it yet, I do not want to do it in the vicinity of my parents, my plan is to do it when I move to uni soon, a place where I am far away from anyone I ever knew. I have written a detailed note on why I am doing it and okay yes I know these problems can be solved, I am not a total dummy, its just that I have lost the will for everything. Everything. I do not want to deal with an ounce of the life I have apparently been blessed with.Even if I seek more help aggressively to prevent my decision, its going to delay it but I have been at it for years since I was probably 15 or 16 so yes if not now then in the near future I am going to do it.

10446,"I have been depressed for a really long time, essentially the majority of my life. In the midst of my current depressive episode I just notice how far back it actually goes and I have gotten 9 or 10 out of 16 years I have been living with this. I want to have a future, I want to have kids and a start a family when I am older, be successful, etc. I do not think I can do any of that if I am depressed at random. Every depressive episode can be triggered by even a mild inconvenience. My depression is only getting worse. Every year I lose the will to live more and more. Its been so long and I will need alot of therapy to get over it but that is the difficult part. By the time I can afford therapy I am scared it will be too late. My parents know about my problems but they ignore it. They know about the self harming, the suicidal thoughts, a rough idea of how long I have been depressed, etc and they do not believe its bad. I have asked for therapy multiple times and its been dismissed. Working a part time job that will allow me to afford therapy in college is iffy, affording therapy fresh out of college is iffy, whether or not I will ever be able to afford therapy is iffy. I see people, on tv, in books, in the news, online, even on subreddits like these, with children; and they constantly express how depressed they are and whether or not they can live for their children. I do not want that to be me. I do not want to grow up never getting the help I need and when I do someday have children, they lose their mother to suicide. Or even worse they grow up with a mother who is depression affects her ability to parent; and she ends up lashing out at her children or being incapable of taking care of them the way they need all the time.I want to try to heal in my life, and I know I cannot do it alone or even with support from loved ones. I know to heal I am going to need professional help, but I do not know if that is attainable. Healing before I can really live my life.",Depression
10452,"I have been struggling with depression for my whole life and I have never had a girlfriend.I can suspect many reasons (but I do not really know the true answer) but the bottom line is it is never happened for me...I have never had the timing/luck to catch women when they are available...they are always taken. I have heard all ""the right person will come to you when you least expect it"" and other such nonsense...I do not believe in it...I am not that lucky.it is very hard meeting someone when you have depression/anxiety disorder. it is so hard to get the kind of confidence that women demand, and/or risk rejection and get the little esteem you have blown away. it is even harder to put on a fake display of pretening to be a happy version of yourself when deep inside I am screaming. And to keep doing this all the time, everytime.For those of you who have (or ever had) a gf or bf at one point, how did you manage to find yourself in a relationship? It is such a curiosity to me. I feel like I am missing out of what others describe as such a 'rich and fulfilling experience'...which adds to depressive state that I have never gotten there. But still, I would like to know. How did you get the courage to ask him/her out? How did you make it work? Question for depressed people who have (or ever had at some point) a gf or bf.",Depression
10455,"I think a huge thing that makes me so depressed is the fact that nothing is permanent. Knowing some day my friends and loved ones will die, some day I will graduate, some day my favorite shows will end, my favorite bands will disband, my boyfriends will leave me, etc; knowing all of it will all end is so distressing. If I make it to 18 I want to get tattoos. Even if they fade, I want to get SOMETHING that is permanent. Maybe when I am 18 things will be better and I can get a cool ""i got over my depression"" tattoo...I do not know if I can go that far, in all honesty. I do not want to kill myself but I do not want to keep seeing everything around me end. Whether its now or in the future I do not want to see the things I love end or die or disappear. I do not want to keep living and it feels like a matter of time before I suck it up and just end it, or until I find that painless method I have been hoping for, or until I come to terms with what happens after death. I know the bad things are permanent. Are there any good things that are permanent? Please tell me about them. Give me something to look forward to. What is permanent?",Suicidal
10456,"Life is an enigma. Yes, that is a bold statement, and no- I cannot explain what I mean.We are born- individually- each being biological miracles. Our consciousness is gifted to us by our parents and relatives. Our appearance: the product of those who are biologically linked to us. Our thoughts, emotions, our very existence was summoned from unknown origins. Scientists cannot explain our consciousness; they cannot explain how humans perceive reality the way they do. We are remarkable, unfathomable creatures.What separates us is our morals, thoughts, interests and preferences. Our single race has so much diversity. There is much good and there is much evil amongst us.I suppose the above was a bit of preface to what Id really like to write about.Its difficult to ponder a question for years upon years, knowing an answer is most definitely unattainable. The questions about our existence and meaning simply do not have answers- or perhaps they do- but they are so far out of our reach that we cannot imagine the answers to such questions.Why we were given the ability to question our existence, if an answer cannot be attained? Is it an error in biology- or is it a call for humans to figure out our origins and meanings? What if there is an answer?How can we choose what purpose our life holds? Most humans assign a purpose to themselves and chase that (for example, becoming a doctor and healing the sick)- others drift aimlessly- and others do not question their lifes meaning at all. I personally do not understand the latter people.What is it that I want?I have many things for which I am grateful for. I am blessed in many areas of life. I have a wonderful partner- who tries to show me how much he loves me each day- and a beautiful son. I have a home, access to clean water, food, electricity and free health care. I still have both of my parents- and I have not suffered the loss of any immediate family members. I am blessed in many instances but why is it that I do not feel fulfilled?What is it that I NEED to feel fulfilled? And what if its not possible to achieve that feeling of fulfilment? What if I spend my entire life yearning for that enigmatic, something greater?I know that I am meant for more. I feel it deep within myself- in fact- its the one truth which I have carried with me throughout my entire life. But I do not understand what it means. What is that more?

Why do not I have any idea what I want to do in the future? Because I do not expect one for myself. I have zero motivation to get anywhere in life, I have no interests that are worth putting time and effort into to better myself. I have heard plenty of adults say its all downhill past 25 (age) well if that is true, what is the point of living past 25? Let the people who really have life aspirations get where they want to be, let them succeed and fulfill their goals, people like me just get in the way. I honestly do not know why I feel this way, I have a supportive family, great friends, heading into junior year with sports to do and everything I should be happy, I should want to keep going, but I do not.

I feel extremely isolated from others - like I am trapped in my own mind. People that used to make me really happy I now feel an indifference towards or worse they make me extremely angry. New people that come into my life seem so bland and uninteresting. Every interaction I have with another person feels so fake. All my responses in conversation feel rehearsed and not genuine; its like instead of actually being apart of a conversation, I am an actor that has their lines already memorized, or a robot with a set of pre-written responses. At the same time, I have developed a very short temper when it comes to talking to people. An otherwise benign statement or conversation topic will instantly sour my mood and when people make mistakes I just cannot seem to let it go and in my head I actively hold it against them. Everyone disappoints me. Maybe I should just isolate myself from society for a while and cut out all of my friends and family.

I have no friends, except for my gf, and my family never calls or says hello. I am an absolute nobody with not a goddamn idea where my life is going.I have had depression for a long time. When I was 15 I tried to speak up about it; and about the suicidal thoughts too. All that really did was get me medicated, and forewarned that if I tried anything Id be locked up in a mental institute for life. I stopped trying to reach out after that. Ever since, I have been trying to convince myself not bite the bullet and take my own life. The meds just make me feel hollow, and any attempt I make trying to improve my mental state just eases my mind temporarily. I do not want sympathy, I am fact, I do not know what I want. I feel like I am just floating through life, but every second I reflect upon who I am I just hate myself. I am a shitty bf, a terrible son, a nobody who means nothing in the world but another average face in the crowd. Another environment destroyer, another annoyance, useless coworker, skipped Reddit post, another fucking nothing.

I am 16, I have found better friends but I realized I am left out a lot, they have all been friends for years and I am new to their group, my depressions gotten better since I started recovering from my alopecia which I had since I was 8, but I feel as though my problems should not be even mentioned to them even though I know I need someone to talk to, their family issues are far worse than mine and whenever I mention something I am going through, they seem to ignore or brush it off, and whenever I support their problems I realize that they have it worse and I feel as though I should not talk to them about anything I am going through because it would only stress them more.

But for the last month and a half or so it hit me like a truck and nothing really terrible happened to trigger this. I feel like no ones really noticed and the ones i do tell just seem confused because I am not physically hurting myself, I am not crying all the time or lashing out like i normally do when it gets bad. But this is the worst I have felt in a long time. I do not even know why I am sad, and it turns into frustration and then anger and then hopelessness. One thing that maybe is not helping is my personal relationships. I am taking a break from romantic things as i had a failed talking stage fairly recently, and even though he and i only talked for a brief period of time and its been a while since i cut things off i cannot get over it. Its affected me way more than it should. I also feel like I am pushing my friends away without even trying. I am not myself right now and i know they can sense it. I do not think I am as fun to be around, if I ever even was. This is the first time I have been this alone. I feel like without a person to swoon over or focus on I am just an empty she will. I know i need to be alone and work on myself, but i feel so stuck. I feel horrible but i cannot cry, I cannot even express how i feel to people and i do not think anyone understands just how terribly hopeless this feeling is.

10479,"I am 27m I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. My childhood was non existent, middle school and high school I was a loner, the only reason people invited me into their groups was because they knew my twin but they would not talk to me. One girl that I somewhat talked to, we had an inside joke that I did not have friends I had acquaintances because no one was really my friend. It was a joke at first but eventually it became real. College I dropped out of during my second year after failing so many classes I just decided school was not for me. But after dropping out I got a part time job and after a couple years I saved up some money and decided to quit I do not know why I just could not take it there anymore. I then moved back with my parents when Covid started but my depression got worse. I was lonely with no friends or anyone to talk to and I ended up texting my ex that I broke up with (to me she is the one that got away) at first it went great we were laughing and talking catching up but after awhile I think she just got more annoyed with me and I honestly never knew what I did wrong and she would never tell me which was never my intention. But I know it was stupid of me to text her, I just wanted to talk to her, catch up or something. I have never had a friend or really talked to anyone. Mostly since my social skills are terrible and people get bored of me quick. I tried to hide my loneliness by keeping myself busy with personal projects like keyboard building, reading and also decided to go back to school and learn programming because it looked interesting even though I have no knowledge about it. But honestly no matter how hard I try to keep myself busy I just end up feeling so down. I cannot even get out of bed sometimes. I just do not know what to do anymore.

Yeah-Last time I was in the mental hospital for wanting to commit die, after kind of ranting about my home life my roommate was telling me that if I wanted to kill myself, they would support me fully.I have literally heard someone have a full on MENTAL BREAKDOWN because they thought that trying to convince me to not kill myself was selfish. Because they felt horrible for just making me suffer longer, and did not know if dying would just be the best option for me.I have shared these thoughts with people close to me and it usually ends with them giving up on me. I cannot count the amount of times I have heard stuff like this.Tell me death would not be the solution to all my problems.

I went through a stretch where I have been doing better at handling my emotions via a few methods like taking a quick second to think of 5 things I can see, 4 I can hear, etc. (its crazy how much that is helped me in day to day life), but I have recently fallen back into patterns of negative thinking that are becoming increasingly debilitating. Whenever I am talking in a large group of people, a good example of this kind of situation would be eating dinner with coworkers, friends, etc., I find myself fading. I think the proper term for this phenomenon I am trying to describe is depersonalization, but I find that fading describes the feeling much more accurately. Ill be talking with someone one second and the next its like I have become more focused on my thoughts than the conversation and thus stop processing the words I am hearing, like I am just zoning out. Big deal right? Everyone does that. The strange part is that I am not even thinking when I fade, I just feel numb. The words I hear start sounding like a foreign language and I have existential feeling as if I am playing a game and the person in front of me does not actually exist. Everything just turns to shapes and noise. Like the world around me is literally blurring and fading away in front of me. Its hard to describe, but there is almost a feeling of fear that washes over me when I fade. Its scary to feel and recognize yourself slipping away.

10511,"Long story short. I had/have an alcohol addiction that led to my now ex breaking up with me last month (June). over the last 7 months leading up to the break up I quit drinking, entered therapy and started taking medication because I did love her and wanted to be better for her. She always asked if I hated her which was never true. I loved her more than I can describe and constantly questioned myself about why I was actively pushing her away. I could not stop myself. the truth was that I never hated her its that I hated that she loved me which I will never understand. During the month of the breakup (June)I started and quit a job that I actually enjoyed due to two very toxic old men who were miserable and bitter. I sent one of them a nasty text due to his petty response to me quitting. I woke up the next day after quitting the job only to find out my now ex is seeing someone else which led me to wonder if she had been fucking this guy every time she went out of state to visit her grandmother. she would visit her grandmother out of state every six months or so. I had doubts (trust issues) but doubts remain doubts unless there is evidence. I managed to find a new job within a day of all of this happening and quit that job tonight after my very first shift because I did not think Id be a good fit I tried to trick myself in to thinking I am changing or becoming a better version of myself but the truth is that I feel more lost than ever. I have told women in the past I loved them but I did not really love them. I just did not want to be lonely and relied on them to make me happy since could not find it within myself. I met my now ex and was head over heels. I wanted to be better for her and for myself. I just could not trust her or allow myself to be vulnerable. I know I have been depressed due to my lack of interest in wanting to do anything, sleeping more, eating less. I feel myself shutting down emotionally but I am trying to fight it off and I am losing. Being sober has been difficult for me because I have to confront all of the shit I actively ignored for the last 2 decades and I do not know how to handle it. I wake up everyday wishing I died in my sleep.As much as I want to end it I am too afraid of death but I am also scared of living. I feel like a broken watch stuck on the time doomed to repeat the same mistakes. I have no purpose, no drive, no hope, no faith. I feel broken and I do not know what to do. I feel like a monster. I feel I deserve to be punished for everything I have ever done and everything I did not do. I have no friends, no partner who I can wake up next to every day and no future. Karma has a way of showing you who you are. I feel like my only purpose in life is to project my self hatred and anger on to others and I hurt them because of it. So what is the point? I feel defeated, weak, unable to succeed or be normal.",Depression
10516,"Long story short I was previously accepted into a combined PA program and the year before I entered my didactic year I had a mental break. I drank a lot and during one episode I cut my forearms to the point where I still have scars 4 years later. My best friend at the time was an RA and at this time had to report me since at the time I threatened anybody attempting to stop my attempt with a knife. Flash forward a year later after my dismissal from the program and gaining my undergrad in health science and another PA program accepts me. It was hard and near the end of my didactic year I ended up hospitalized and losing a week of my rotation in womens health. I ended up having to redo my rotation and passed during the summer semester. But I passed my didactic and clinical year. I have a degree that nobody could ever take from me. I passed.But low and behold the F for womens health shows up on my transcript. Granted, it shows I passed after my second attempt but my parents are still disappointed in me.I tried emailing, calling, petitioning, doing whatever I can to get that F off my transcript knowing its not going to effect anything, just to make sure that I did the best I can.I completed the PANCE today. Basically its a national exams for To-be-PAs to pass. But at this point I do not even care if I pass. Nothing I do will please anybody and I sacrificed my life for this. I spent so much time and sacrificed so much just to get this fucking license that I do not even care about anymore. Death makes life decisions significantly easier to make.

10525,"I have suffered more than is bearable, and it is mostly the result of my own terrible choices. Granted there were things beyond my control, but all in all I had a very good and privileged childhood, with a lot of love. There is mental illness and addiction in my family tree, my parents were both abused as children, and although they did the best with what they have I began to show symptoms of deep depression and anxiety as an adolescent. I started to experiment with drugs and drinking, and I never stopped (33 now). I am not sure which came first, the addiction or the emotional problems, but they seemed to work in tandem. I have lost everything there is to lose but my life, which is also in jeopardy due to a stroke and possible anurysm (I do not know, because doctors have been unable to diagnose me, but I pretty much know that is what is going on). Every relationship I have had has failed due to my addiction and being a terrible partner. I have not hardly touched another person in five years. I am drinking a six pack a day and using opiates. I cannot help but think of what my life could have been had I not gotten sick, had I not have into the narrative in my mind that I am inadequate and a terrible person. I cannot blame my mother for how she raised me, she was remarkably together considering the unbelievable abuse she suffered from her mentally ill mother. it is just the luck of the draw I guess, but I cannot shake the feeling that my pathetic life was my own creation (it was) and that it is not going to get better. What would make me think it is just somehow going to improve? I cannot be myself around people, I am so anxious I can barely speak and when I do it is just faking having a personality. I have no soul or integrity. I cannot even control my own behavior or stop drinking. And now my health is failing as a result. I do not think I will make it frankly but I am so afraid of the pain it would because my family that I cannot bear to go through with it. Alcoholism and opiate addiction, borderline personality disorder, and living with neurological problems resulting from a stroke and unruptured aynurism.",Suicidal

I valued and still to an extent still value my intellect over and above other things and factors of my being which now I do not say is good and healthy. I once had a prolonged period of heightened self conscious awareness where I felt like I was the one in controll of my thoughts even when I was just being an asshole narcissist that went as far to screw up my brain chemistry and composition from all of the stress and anxiety I subjected myself to (which is funny because I had hypochondria of getting brain damage or neurological damages and it still probably happened). Now that the feelings I felt during that time are gone, and I wanted them back for a while, I questioned and interrogated myself, my family, and my morals all for the feelings of being superior again cognitively. Now, about 5 months after this.

My other job was god awful with stress, i would put in lots of overtime and we were very short staffed constantly, and as an ASM, i had a lot of pressure on me to get things done and right 100% of the time. The only thing that kept me around there was the fact that i got along with everyone. My boss was someone i genuinely looked up to as a person and as a professional. Now at my new job, i found out one of my bosses is the least liked in the store, so now I am dealing with the anxiety that I am going to disappoint her and she is going to have it out for me eventually.

I cut myself to feel control, to feel like I have a choice in the narrative that I am experiencing. it is the only way I know how.It would be like if the 5 main characters of the movie were living their life but there was also a secret 6th character, repression.

They are forced to watch him ruin the life they made and cannot do anything about it. They have no control and can only watch what unfolds. They can give suggestions, like go to bed on time or exercise, but he will not take that advice. So finally, to feel some sense of control in this hell, they suggest something he will like.

10546,"Due to a bad childhood, horrible socializing skills as a kid, and other things in between, I fucking suck at emotionally connecting to anyone. I do not have any attachments to my family, since my bad childhood mostly involves them. I only have 4 close friends, and they are amazing ones, but I have only really connected to and opened up to 1. I could easily relate to her and we could talk for hours on end. We took a few month break for her to focus on her mental health. Now that were talking again, it just feels like we lack the connection we use to have. I still cherish her and everything, but sometimes it just feels one sided, but I cannot blame her. She recently got a lot of new friends and just has a busy life in general. My 3 other friends, while close, I have only opened up to one and that was ages ago. When I did, his parents saw my messages, told the school principal who then proceeded to call my mom, which made some issues for me. Ever since then, the only person I have opened up to is the friend I mentioned first. I have talked to her about some of my issues, but I do not want to burden her. She already feels guilty for not being there during our break. My last 2 remaining friends, its hard to open up to since I have never talked to them about this stuff at all, at least on my side. The best thing about the emotional connection I had with my friend originally, was that it made me feel happy unlike anything else. It made me feel like I was living. I still feel that way when we have a fun time with each other or have a good convo, but now its just a double edge sword to me, with the sad feelings that come with it. I do not have anyone else to rely on, to relate to, or anyone there for me. I do not think me and her will ever go back to way that we were before, and that scares me. I would have no connections then. I would just be a sack of flesh walking on this earth. Suicidal ideas have came back.

Or they did initially but daily exposure to this shitty planet numbed them to it. What I am getting at is, I am not that type of person. I grew up with an over imaginative mind as my dad used to call it. I would write fictional stories, skits for my siblings, and make short films with dinosaur cut outs I drew. To this day, I have so many aspirations outside of this career, but having a wife, kid, house, vehicles, bills, and mentally draining job have basically killed all my dreams of publishing a fictional book or making a fan film in my free time.

Someone I was once really close with killed herself last weekend. I did not even go to the fucking funeral. It was not going to make me feel better so I did not go. And now I think Ill regret that for a very very long time. I have tried the therapy and I tried the meds, I had DNA testing done for fucks sake, to see which meds my body will metabolize the best. And what do you know, there is only a handful that my body will ACTUALLY metabolize. I have tried half of them already. They either make it worse, or make you numb. I am not sure which Id rather have? Neither? I just do not want to exist anymore. I do not have the guts to commit but I really wish I did. I do not think it gets better",Depression

I try to go out more with friends. Hell, today even I had a haircut for the first time in months. Whenever I feel like things are getting back on track I randomly get this feeling of everthing coming down and not being worth it anymore. Tonight I even kind of realised my dog is old and is going to be gone any day now. What do I do man. I went to some sessions with a shrink but it did not go anywhere. Maybe I did not tell he enough? I do not know. One of the few things keeping me on this side is that I am too lazy to write a suicide letter to everyone. Mayyyyyyybe the feeling of leaving my mom sad? But that I do not know. I thought few (maybe too many) times of slashing my wrists lenghtwise in the shower. (Quick sidenote as I am writing this I really do not want my dog to die man). I fear the day I am in enough despair I do not care about suicide letters or anything. What do I do? I do not wamna leave guys but there are times I do not see other options.

10603,"I am 16 and I really want to die but I am afraid that I am going to have a failed attempt and my life's going to get worse. I wish I did not have to think this way, I wish my parents let me study what I wanted so I was not such a failure and a disappointment to them. In the beginning of this year, I broke down and told my mother that I could not concentrate on my studies no matter how hard I tried and that I did not think I would be capable to study science in Grade 11 but she did not listen to me. She told my father and he did nothing but berate me and they told me that if I act crazy again, they would punish me. I am very scared of disappointing people but no matter how hard I try, I end up doing just that. I cannot back away from anything now, my courses have been paid for and they are really expensive and I do not think my parents could afford losing all that money. Even if they could recuperate, I am certain that they are going to make my life hell and not allow me to change to any other course. I really wanted to study literature and I was really fond of reading books and learning languages, but all the pressure to be something I am not made me lose the will to even pick up a book and I do not feel interested in doing anything anymore. I used to be good at English and writing papers and loved learning but now I am barely even passing English. I do not have a way to fix this and neither do I have a way out. I feel like a failure around people my age because they seem to have set their mind on what they are studying and are excelling. My parents want me to sit for the national medical entrance test which is in 1.5 yrs but I know I am going to fail it and I have nothing I can do after that. I am tired of feeling like a failure, I am tired of pretending I am trying my best, I am not trying at all, I cannot try. I just want all this to stop. I do not want to keep on lying to everyone around me but I am too scared to kill myself.",Suicidal

10613,"I am a 26 year old who lives somewhere in Latin America. I am quite well economically, I have a job in technology not affected by the pandemic, I am physically healthy.Many people I have met across all ages told me I am very intelligent. I can learn anything I put my will to, and I am typically complimented at work. I can speak various languages as well, and had some breakthrough achievements at work. I was lucky enough to have a good family that supported whatever choices I made, and I could travel and live in Europe for a little more than two years. Some people think I am good looking and interesting, I was able to have a healthy sex life in my youth with people all over the world.Many people would kill to have at least one or two of the things I have described above...Funnily enough, as cheesy as it sounds, I feel like killing someone too, myself. Or rather, I would like to stop existing...do not worry if you think this is a suicide note, I am not going to do anything yet.I have made a pathetic attempt before on my life some years ago. I was not in any life threatening situation, but I called an ambulance and told them I had tried to commit suicide. Trying to commit suicide is a crime in my country. As my perfect luck would have it, the police chief assigned to me that night saw me as a very desperate and lonely person, and wrote off my attempt as a cry for help. My parents came to the hospital, the police chief evaded his responsibilities, and I was able to get out a few days later. I went home as if nothing ever happened, I still have large scars on one of my wrists, meaning that this event will chase me forever.Some days I forget that scar is there. Some days I look at it but do not even pay any attention to it. I do not cover it with long sleeves, but I always have that scar facing my body, so other people will not see it.But it will always follow me through the rest of my days.A couple of years ago I returned to my country. I had been in Europe studying at an University as part of some program. Ever since that day, I have done nothing but work. I am thankful for the work I have, and I am climbing the ladder very quickly and I will be able to easily find a job anywhere in the world.However, I have no friends. No one I can a friend. All my relations now are just acquaintances from work. I have a very hard time being sociable. My depression has made me completely boring and unable to relate to anyone, or have a normal conversation. I have misophonia, so the sounds that people make give me a strong painful reaction. Think like every human sound is the sound of nails on a chalkboard.I do not have any hobbies. If I do feel like doing something, it most likely is something I can enjoy by myself. I try to avoid social interactions as much as possible.Due to the pandemic, I was able to move back with my parents and work from home. I live in another town a few kilometers away from work and I can save more money for investments, but I have no social life at all. The relation with my family is null. Just the bare minimum and the essentials. No love or emotions allowed.Just as I move everything from my house and finally move in with my parents, my coworkers decide to start hanging out regularly. They meet at bars and have a drink or two. I should not really care about this, but it has really affected me.Is it a hard coincidence from life? One of those motherfucking facts of life? Or were they always waiting for me to move away?In any case, my emotions right now would not have been different. I feel betrayed, even if I should not feel like so.The coworkers are young like myself, and while I am above them in the ladder, I always saw them as my equals. I spent many hours helping them, educating them on work topics they did not feel comfortable enough.One of them is a girl I have some feelings for, but she does not have the same back. However, she wants to stay friends. She noticed that I am not feeling well, since we do not talk as much through text chats on the phone.I may have ruined the ""perfect image"" I am always showing to the rest of the world, and to her as well. If there ever was a chance that me and her would hook up or something, I do not think that is possible anymore.One side of me wants to give them another chance, maybe if I ask, we can all meet and drink, and share nice stories! Maybe I can rebuild the chat I had with this girl, and who knows what could happen.The other side of me wants to destroy this relation, never come back to the office, never chat with them again, break my promises with this girl, and escape as soon as possible.If you think this sounds very childish, it is because I never developed how to control my emotions. I am very sensitive to things that people say or think about me. My emotions are stuck in pre-teen mode.I do not know what is this feeling I have right now. They are all negative. I feel betrayed, angry, in despair, saddened. For the first time in a long time, I have been just lying in bed doing nothing.From this little slip in my emotions, I can turn self destructive, and the short or long relations I have had, destroy them. Which in turn, gradually transforms the slip into a downfall. But hey, it is not all that bad. In a few months, once the pandemic calms down and I am fully vaccinated, I will be able to go to Europe.I have told my bosses about my idea, and they are in support, and even offered me the chance to work remotely from there. Get some money on the side while I find a more suitable work option. it is all going to be all right, correct? Except, the same things that happen to me here in my country, have happened in the previous times in Europe, and will absolutely happen again. The exact same things I wrote above, happened in my country all through my childhood and further. It happened on my first trip to Europe. It happened when I returned. It happened when I went back to Europe, and now, it happened again.When do this shit change? Hahaha Just got to survive for a couple more months, and everything will be all right.... correct? When do this shit change?",Depression
10617,"I do not know any communities where being sad but not exactly depressed. Like I do not feel like shit all the time or for long periods of time, just in bursts like a mild depressed state.Whenever I get in these states, I tend to think of how much I hate my life(but I do not). I do not really feel the need to commit suicide or have a strong desire too but I do think about it, I guess often but have never tried it. Maybe I am in denial but I am never talking to some therapist or even friends and family about my personal issues. I try to keep my thoughts and emotions private and confined. One thing I do feel is, I have an intense desire to be alone. I feel fake, like forced happiness everyday to talk to friends and my family. I just want to be alone, for a long time. Sometimes, I wish I had the balls to run away and disappear or just move out. But no, I continue to sit at home each day, playing video games and watching youtube as I have cheated on every assignment and test since I have started college. I really do not know what to do with my life, I know I am a failure but I will not feel terrible tommorow. I could die tonight and I hope I am forgotten as quickly as possible, I do not want anyone to know except whoever has too.But I will just be better in the morning and go along with life until I hit another depressed mood.

10624,"(Warning: Long read)I seriously do not know what to do anymore. I am 27 years old, still live at home, have no friends, no so, no life, no fluctuating income. I feel so stuck and no matter what I try to come up with, they never hold any weight. I am on ssi disability for severe mental health issues that I have tried addressing thru pills and therapy, been there done that and it has never worked out for the better. Also for this reason I have not been gainfully employed for the last few years. With my state of my mind and circumstance I would not want to wage slave to come home to this same situation anyways. If I did my mental health would probably tank even worse just for a couple bucks. It are not worth it. We all know making friends was hard before covid, now after all this craziness it is like good luck with that you know? I have no life at all. I have been watching mma like ufc fights for a long time and only till recently started training mma and kickboxing. With me not having a life thought it would be a great outlet and it is but it is not enough, not at all.Classes are like 1 hour a piece and they hold classes 4 days out of the week and honestly I am not old old but I are not a young buck anymore so even doing like 3 classes a week, an hour a piece has been beating my body down. I am so sore I can barely bend down down or move. I am hoping by Monday I can train again...Even if I had a body of a 18 year old and I could go all day long, 1 hour a day to do something still does not compare to the 23 hours I have left with nothing to do. I am 27, time is just ticking and everything I can try I do not have what it takes to do it and everything I do have what it takes I have tried and failed over and over again. Yes you fail you try again but the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results. Given my circumstance I have tried everything, tried to really rack my brain to drastically change my situation and honestly no amount of self reevaluation has helped me figure this out.Me being a mental wreck at most things in life, some days I accept that my life may be this way for good but I just wish I had some friends or ""A"" friend to talk to or just confide in. it is one thing to go thru all of this but to do it in solitude is just so soul crushing. I know I am a guy and I am supposed to suck it up and find a way and keep trying but how long can I keep trying? This stupid anxiety is the curse of my life I swear. If I was not such a spastic loser none of this would be happening. If I at least had some friends or someone who gave a crap about me maybe I would have the motivation to mustard up some kind of idea or something I have not tried which Idk what since I have thought about everything but this loneliness, this emptiness inside me is killing me. I am close to crying as I type this but I am trying to contain myself. Nobody cares and why should they? I am a miserable, bitter, angry, lonely, loser with nothing to show for in life after being on this planet for 27 years. I had a passion in acting and music but none of those things are guarantee and it is like winning the lottery.it is ironic because usually people who make it in that industry are pretty fucked in the head like me but they got lucky. I feel like I have the mindset of someone who is famous, at least creativity wise and having a good amount of crazy in them but we all know that industry is over saturated it is all dumb luck. They get to release all that craziness but my talent is all wasted and I am just left with the craziness, nothing else. For people who would tell me , just keep pursuing it, it is not as simple. If you do not have movie looks or some kind of connections, you will be doing small short films or student films that go nowhere, that is reality of holly wood. So at the end of the day, it would take one crazy ass miracle to get me out of this situation. I used to be like wow I am 24 now, I am 25 now and now I am 27, 3 years behind 30. it is nuts man. Why and how did I turn out this way? Was it destiny? I feel like some people are meant to suffer all of their lives no matter what. Like you can play my life scenario a thousand different ways and I feel like some how I will always end up here in the exact spot, sitting in this chair typing these exact words.

That way I would be able to afford college after highschool. Bit I figured there would be enough time in college and afterwards to make memories with friends.

The wedding was lovely and I am happy for them both. But god do I hate everything about weddings. I do not have and never have had a romantic relationship or anything close to it. Unsurprisingly then, weddings make me feel even more alone and unlovable and worthless. But I also hate the reception. I do not dance because I am overwhelmed by anxiety at the thought. So initially I tried to stay off to the side at this wedding. Unfortunately I felt that by not dancing I was even more noticeable. Eventually I went and took some xanax to calm myself down. Once it started kicking in I was feeling good and actually started dancing with the rest of the wedding party. And i had fun. Why is this bad you might ask? Because it showed me how my mental illness was holding me back from enjoying life. I cannot take strong drugs like xanax often (it is for emergencies only). This makes me want to try recreational drugs which I know I should not do and are illegal in my state.So here I am. Back home feeling worthless, lonely and suicidal, somewhat disassociated from reality. Fuck me.

I am just scared to.i want to spend time with my friends and enjoy it, but after an hour of doing so i often end up wanting to isolate and tackle boring statistics or learn about some ridiculous topic just to do something.i wanted to go to college for pharmacology. my knowledge on the subject broadens every day, and i employ it to help people as much as i can and its worked.i used to listen to music. now i skip 80% of the tracks in my playlist. i used to feel butterflies within me when i spent time with my girlfriend, but even though i love her with every last fiber of my being, it does not feel the same.i have a novel presently with ~50k words. i love my literary tongue, and i would love to pursue it, but i just do not.all i do is play that one video game and read.is anybody else amid an inertia like this? any kind of comment would make me feel good.

Add that to my true identity as a trans girl which my parents do not know about and I do not want them to find out, a lot is riding on this secrecy. Today, though, my parents restated this ban on what I am doing, and threatened extreme punishment. I know I should really stop this, but my emotional happiness kind of depends on this account. My sexual frustration can be released, I can realize my true femininity, I can find communities and social interaction that I desperately need. The decision of whether I should keep doing what I am doing, quietly delete this account, or come clean and face the consequences is heavily weighing on me, to the point where I am actively feeling a little sick. What do I do? I really need some emotional support and advice. I know telling them is probably the morally right thing to do, but I have no way of knowing whether that will just make my suffering even more pronounced.

I do not want to have crazy expensive cars and bags and all that but a safe home, new clean furniture that is not old and scratched and a new reliable car. And it just depresses me so much that as hard as we try it just is a perpetual state of worry over money. Life is to short yet to be worry about money all the time but I just cannot help it. Its on my mind constantly and it makes me unable to eat. I fear checking the bank account after bills come out and I hate getting the mail everyday because I am always worried that its going to be some crazy bill I did not know about and bad news. Usually I am a hopeful person but my depression and anxiety has gotten way worse over the past few years. I did not have the best start in life like my peers in the area I lived in. They all have parents that put them through college, gave them money to start businesses or buy houses and I feel like a loser because I have had to do it all myself and my husbands story is the same. I always feel people look down on me because I am poor but I try so hard. I wish I could just get a little money to give myself a head start but I know that is not going to happen and I am just super depressed that I am stuck in this cycle that I cannot control. cannot go back to school for nursing like my dream because I have to work. I do not know how to pull myself out of these problems and this depression because I feel like there is now way out. I feel I would not be so bad off if I had money to live",Depression
10665,"30 days from now I will be 16. It feels surreal to be honest. My entire life up to this point has just been a disappointing miserable mush of trauma and the desire to let it end already. In all honesty its been like this all my life. For almost as long as I can remember, slowly becoming more and more obvious as time went on. Life does not feel real, just a lump of memories, few good, mostly bad and a dream like feeling. Like there is not someone in there, just a she will of what a human ought to be. One of my first memories is being six and looking in the mirror and hating how I did not ""look and act like a person"" and comparing myself to my classmates. They looked like people. They acted like people. I did not feel like one. It terrified me back then that I was going to be an adult, probably because of how different a child and an adults responsibilities were. I remember being nine, and being petrified that I was halfway to becoming an adult. I want to go back to that state. I am scared. Scared of turning 18. When I was 12 and the awful became worse I promised myself I would kill myself at 16 if things did not get better. Shortly after that I changed it to 18, maybe its because that back part of my brain was a coward, but I convinced my self it was because my family would have to see my body. My disgusting ugly self with an equally atrocious brain. And here I am, almost approaching the age that has scared me all my life. 760 days until I am 18. I truly do not ever think I will escape this depressing mindset I locked myself into so young. I am empty, I am emotionally drained and ready to go missing for weeks before my body is finally discovered decaying in some forest. I do not know how I will die. I do not know if ill be able to kill myself on the exact day I turn 18. Not that it would matter. Nobody would care if I died. My parents certainly would not, they are the ones who watered this miserable seed of,,whatever this is in my head. They do not even leave their rooms anymore. Not that I care. Being around them any longer then humanly necessarily would just make me feel worse. My life honestly feels so wasted. I can barely eat something without feeling like I am going to vomit. Its this constant sense of nausea. Why did I have to be born into this body? Why this brain? Why do I feel like I am watching a car crash behind a foggy windshield everyday? what is wrong with me? Can a truck just crash threw my house and kill me lol. I wish I did not get up when I tripped that one time while I crossed the street when I was younger. Face smashed in with no chance of living, and I get seen as this tragic death of a young girl and my parents and classmates might have actually pretended to like me for a week or two. Oh well.Sorry for this, I do not know why my brain is being so bad in particular. Maybe its the insomnia talking. Most days I can suck it up and just keep it in my head, or write a little two paragraph vent that scratches the surface of my stupid idiotic thoughts. But hey, pitbulls been there done that so maybe I am just much more weak willed then I put on. Thanks for listening, lol. The Final Chapter of my life has begun.",Suicidal

And worst of all, I feel that everyday I am losing who I am, and I just need to get this pain out, just feel a bit of enjoy on my life. I am tired of fighting for what I think is right: caring for other, looking for friends, searching for the good for everyone (even me). This has only brought on me pain and dread, I cannot be the person that I wanted to be and that makes me empty. I do not feel to be a bad person, I cannot ignore other people's emotions, and if I am made fun of it, I am being called fucking stupid for it, for everyone I know, maybe its that I am not made to be in this world.

I do not know how severe my depression is but what I do know is that it keeps getting worse. I lack interest in everything I do and most of the stuff I want to do I put them off and get bumed when I do not do it. I have thought of suicide in my teen years, I tried to act on it once but did not go through it, right now this thought is way more present each day. I feel that one day when I am alone and depressed I might act on it, I am just tired of this feeling that nothing is worth it, that I am wasting my life just being sad. I am going to therapy, have 6 months in therapy now but I feel nothing is working, I have tried to be more positive, I just feel so damn alone and that the only way to stop this feeling is finishing my life.

10672,"i have no other options but to go on anti depressants. I have been suffering with chronic depression since I was 12. I am 22 in September. I have gone through sexual assault and developed PTSD bc of it. I also have a severe ridiculous anxiety disorder plus a history with anorexia and other eating disorders. Through all this time I have tried everything to pull myself out of the shithole, I went through a period of time where I was addicted to hard exercise, I spend a lot of time pouring time into my career which is my life long passion, have been going tk therapy for a year and a half. last year things got so bad for me and I felt so deeply alone that I got myself a puppy. Right now she is the ONLY reason I go outside and get 10 thousand steps daily. I really was hoping that my pup could make me feel less lonely, but she is actually quite detached. In her 7 months of life I have never been able to cuddle with her - she does not like it, and I am not going to force her. She tends to gravitate to my mother much more despite the fact that I am the person who feeds her, walks her, trains her and generally takes care of her hygiene. I have realized recently that this might be because I am filled with nothing but negative, putrid energy, which makes sense how a young pup might not want to be around me. I still love her deeply but yet again I have reached another disappointment where I just keep being a problem.The only reason I refuse to go on medication is because I do not want to gain weight as a result, I know not all medicines do this, but most will do it. My self esteem is already below hell and if my eating disorder is triggered I might actually kms. Its stupid, but I just refuse. I hate being alive. this is stupid",Depression

Not even disappear I guess more just like never to have existed. I feel so alone and honestly just weird. I tried to explain it to one person a few months ago but cannot exactly stitch together the correct sentences to make it comprehensible. But I feel like everything is paper, flimsy and like I am about to fall over or fly away. Everything is draining even the idea of sleeping is too much for my body to handle, which is weird because I thought depressed people loved to sleep, but somehow sleeping just makes things worse. I feel stuck in this bubble where I do not feel anything. Its worse than a fog. I can see things around me but I do not feel like I am apart of them. I also have totally separated myself from everyone socially. I never was one to have many friends, but I have recently deleted and removed all of my accounts and friends from said accounts. I have blocked all numbers besides two people and honestly do not feel any remorse, even though I have known some of them for several years.

My home was very hard growing up. My dad was hardly home either working or at a bar coming home very late and drunk. My mom used me as a dependent and still does which is exhausting. Keep in mind I am (33 f) years old. My family bullied me physically and emotionally growing up. Calling me all kinds of names and that I could not ever do anything. I have had very little friends and have been hurt by friends and even family down the road. It is almost impossible for me to trust people. I feel so unloved and so Insignificant and small. Every time I have always tried to do the right thing or do good, something has always come my way to destroy it. I cannot even look forward to anything anymore because I do not trust anything good will happen. I have gotten so used to things crumbling in front of me. I wake up most days angry at the fact that I woke up and that I want to end my life but am too much of a coward to do so.

I am still living with my parents, I am working as a janitor at a school, I have a useless college degree, I have never had a girlfriend or been on any dates.

I am only 22 and I should be a lot more out there. My wife says its from my past and how my father was not really there and my mother was not really worth looking up to. And that because of all that I was never taught how to love a woman. My wife also said I should see a therapist about it. But I do not know how talking with someone will help. So, I am reaching out here first. I believe it has to do something with my testosterone or something because I just never feel like doing anything fun.And one thing that I really do not understand is why my sex drive is so low.

10709,"I can no longer articulate the prolonged suffering that is my existence. The misery, the loneliness, the sorrow, and the anguish should all be worth a thousand words. Yet, as I acknowledged it is simply not possible to undertake the expansive task that is examining and assessing my despair.I have never had a single friend in my life. I have researched everything that there is to research about making friends, human behaviors, etc.I just have a natural fundamental deficiency/misunderstanding of human procedures. These problems will follow me my entire life and once you have awareness of the human condition, with no hope of overcoming it, it becomes definitive proof that life is not worth living. I seem to lack the natural stillness that everyone else seems to possess. In my opinion, the key to happiness in life is harmony with oneself, acceptance of that which cannot be changed, and a determination to change that which is indeed malleable, a consistent self-awareness and perpetual thought on how to be the best version of oneself and to respect all life in all its forms no matter what. The problem is the things that I need to fix are not malleable. They should be natural. You should be born with them. I feel ungrateful because I have such a mundane life. I have not been abused, raped, neglected, or anything like that. I have no trauma.I know a lot of the answers will be some variation of how I should learn to be alone. You can not ""learn"" to be alone. Few people chose to be completely and utterly alone. I want to fix it yet, it is simply not possible. There is no cure. There has to be something I am missing. I rationalize this all the time. There has to be some kind of resounding character flaw I am missing.I find myself slowly become a bitter resentful person. Seeing people live so normally and naturally angers me. Socialization to them is breathing. It requires no thought. They have everything I want.I find that the few things that brought me happiness no longer work.

As selfish as it sounds, no one actually cares about me, no one wants me, no one gives a crap, and this is something I have realised time and time again. I am always alone, everything I do, I do it by myself. No one shows up to any birthdays or they cancel for the last 15 years so I do not bother and spend it by my self. I feel like I fall in the cracks of every aspect of life. I understand that I should be grateful for the things that I have, but Id give that all up and do anything to remember what true happiness feels like one last time. I Used to make an effort with my appearance, health and with myself. Since corona, I do not care about my appearance anymore, I am losing my hair, I am gaining weight. I have lost the desire to drink/ smoke socially. I have no faith or trust left in friends, family, teachers, basically most things, all they do is: disappoint, let down, pick on, bully, backstab or do something really dumbRecently I realised I have anxiety and have become and introvert. I have withdrawn from all social media and become a hermit. I do not even talk to anyone not even my sisters or step sisters. I do not know why I am writing this, I guess I have gone through so much crap in my life I am sick and tired of it all, sorry for sounding like a pathetic piece of garbage, but In all honesty I am not afraid of dying, at least Ill feel something.

I do so much for certain individuals and they will come back to bite the hand that feeds them. Sickening. How do these people interact and live like this. I do not even feel emotion anymore after being hurt so consistently over and over again. I am at the point where I just do not care what happens. I am lonely hurt and pained on the inside. Wish somebody could just help. Wish I had a faithful loving women to help me out this rutt. Fucking hell, I grind so damn much and life does not progress. I pray to God things change this year. So sad at this life man. Another lonely day of bottling my feelings. I must sound like a little bitch from how much I am complaining, but gosh I never ever ever vent. So it kind of does feel better.

I am so tired, i do not think this life is worth it, i know I am still young but it is already so draining. i wish my parents cared a little. or just showed that they do. i immediately regret it when i vent to someone about something because i feel like they only listen to me because I am their friend and they will just move on with their lives once I am done. i wish my mom would hug me.

10725,"Depression is an old friend at this point. I do not even remember what its like for my brain to be normal. That said its been getting a lot darker these days and so I guess I am hoping putting this out there helps or something. I do not know what the hell to do anymore.To shorten a very long story, I am a single dad stuck at home 100% of the time with 3 kids. Ex left me for a old boyfriend, sucked but whatever I got over it. I was able to work from home and help take care of the kids, keep things normal-ish. Thank God for my parents. Without their help Id have gone insane or more likely put a bullet in my mouth a long time ago.Things were going ok ish until covid. Suddenly the kids are stuck home all the time, bored and driving me crazy. Their mom is flaking out again so I am without much help. My oldest son is a nightmare. Long gone is the sweet boy I knew and hes replaced with a narcissistic psychopath. Yeah, yeah I know all teenagers are bad but no. I legitimately use the clinical definition of psychopath here. I 100% think hes about one life crisis away from the beginning of a Netflix true crime documentary on a serial killer.We tried therapy but it does not help. Hes a master at lying, deflecting and putting on whatever mask he thinks will work best for you at this moment. After the 3rd time he did not come home and the cops brought him back we had him go to an inpatient facility for teens. We all breathed a collective sigh. Finally peace for us and maybe just maybe he will get some help. Nope a few weeks later hes back and has not changed.For a while he was able to live with his mom most of the time. But her new marriage imploded and now she is quasi homeless. Great now I am back to them all being here 100% of the time, no end in sight. My parents can take the younger 2 for brief stints but cannot handle him, nor do I want them to have to.So here I sit at my kitchen table, staring down the barrel of at least 5 more years of this shit. I have a nicer prison than most I guess. Still able to work, buy shit for hobbies that I do not give a shit about anymore, sunlight and fresh air.I do not actually want to kill myself but dark thoughts are no stranger, and I am getting more comfortable with not being alive. Even started thinking about what ifs for after I am gone. The only comfort I get these days is eating so I figure my heart will give out within the next decade and solve the problem for me if things do not change.Well there it is, there is my story and yeah I do not feel any better. Hell I am not sure why I thought I would. I do not feel period these days. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk or something. Trapped",Depression
10727,"I just realized I have been off my meds since June 29th, Because of my wisdom teeth surgery and other thingsLife is not as interesting or exciting as fantasies I create, its just disappointing. I constantly daydream or escape reality in my head. All the things I was interested in are just gone or I have mental will to do it. I do not play games cuz I get too tired or disinterested in it. I use to have a passion for cooking but I barely cook now. I am also overweight and I keep eating garbage even though I know I need to stop. I have been trying to stop but its like I cannot stop until after eating the shit. I started working and its a retail job ya know. Got tired of doing Jack shit and was feeling academically burnt out. Quickly learned i need to go and get a degree or skill. But nothing excites me fully, burnt out eventually or I am afraid of working hard due to how it led to my mental spiral for 2 years.I also ended a 10 year long friendship with someone who I also dated in the past officially. I thought I blocked them and would never hear from them again but there they were with a long message and their name. It gave me a panic attack and ruined my mood. Then I guess it kicked off my horrible feelings.I also feel broken. I am trans. People think its gross. I am not very good looking, fat, do not have a degree, I do not think I am very sexual or just asexual, I just know I have trauma from dating from the past. I have also just tired of the depression, anxiety, ocd, and whatever else going on. I am tired of the pills and having to remember taking them. I want a new brain or something. I do not plan on hurting myself. I cannot. My family already lost my cousin to it, and I just cannot do it on them again. But if I could never wake up, that would be great.

10736,"For context, I am a journalist student and it is a area that is struggling a lot in my country. I am 21, I have a little experience with it but I cannot get a job/paid internship. I am always seeking opportunities, always trying to learn more about the newer demands of my job, and still, no one wants to hire me. I look around and all I see is my friends from college getting their first jobs in the area, gaining experience, doing amazing stuff and I am proud of them, but I am also extremely jealous. I want to grow, I want and need a job, but always getting a no is consuming my mental health in so many levels that I am starting to not know how to deal with it.Last month I applied for a internship in L'oreal, it was the dream job for me. Ended up I did not get it (of course) yet the interviewer said I did well. It made me so sad, I think it triggered my depression. I do not feel like trying hard the way I used to, I feel hopeless, like I am really not enough, not qualified enough. I will graduate next year and I am starting to feel that I am waiting my time. Even though I have one of the best grades in my class, I still do not feel enough. I do not even know if this count for something anymoreI see people with less experience than me, people that are not trying that hard for something and yet, they manged to get a job and I am in the same place... I even started to develop my own journalistic project, trying to do something that I truly believe, love and want to put my all into it, but slowly, day by day I am starting to loose faith in it as well... I talked to close friends about it and all I get is empty words (I am quite sure they are not, probably it is just my mind trying to self sabotage itself).I just do not know what to do anymore, everyone is moving on, doing amazing things and I am here doing absolutely nothing. I do not feel like I get comfort from people, and honestly I do not know why I seek it since it is my issue and I got to solve it own my own.

I have been struggling a lot the last couple weeks with (mostly) passive suicidal ideation, something I have dealt with since i was very young. sometimes though it is not passive anymore, and i go to sleep every night thinking of ways to just end it because life is too much and I am not worth the effort for other people. idk, its been a rough time lately never thought id reach my age and now i do not know what to do",Suicidal

I have had a lot of anxieties since I was a child and never had many friends growing up because maybe people thought I was weird for being so shy and timid due to all my anxieties. My home was very hard growing up. My dad was hardly home either working or at a bar coming home very late and drunk. My mom used me as a dependent and still does which is exhausting. Keep in mind I am (33 f) years old. My family bullied me physically and emotionally growing up. Calling me all kinds of names and that I could not ever do anything. I have had very little friends and have been hurt by friends and even family down the road. It is almost impossible for me to trust people. I feel so unloved and so Insignificant and small.

I cannot even look forward to anything anymore because I do not trust anything good will happen. I have gotten so used to things crumbling in front of me.

I currently also have nothing to do irl as its summer break (I am 16), so I literally spend my whole day watching YouTube or playing something, tho even playing games gets boring really fast if you do not have people to play with. I also do not have any kind of big goal in life I would want to work towards, as a matter of fact I am not even that interested in trying to find one either. How I have ended up with so few active friendships / none at all is a bit complicated so I am leaving it out here, but it was not that anything particularly bad came to be between anyone and me, its more that over time I just got less close with some of them. I also have tried finding new friends online, where I have found some different people, but still not like a group that I could spend time with regularly, and I have not yet made the effort to really try and get to know new people irl, and I am also not so motivated to do so bc; getting to know ppl irl hard. But yea, again, this is really not a nice place to be in, because literally the only people i talk to in days at this point are my parents occasionally, and then I text with some people and have perhaps like 2 calls but that is it.

10743,"ThrowawayIm female, 20 years old. Ever since I was 12 I have been on antidepressants, antipsychotics for severe depression and anxiety. My parents are divorced since I was 2. they have both been in relationships after. I have lived with my mother and majority of my life its just been us two living together. My brother lived with my father. My mother was in a relationship when I was 11. We moved in with him. He abused her mentally and physically. I heard everything. I saw the scars. Fast forward a few years later she dated another guy. I had met this guy before, we lived with him when I was around 7. It did not last. Last year we got a call that he had hung himself. My father does not understand mental illness. He often calls me a baby or a child and tells me to just suck it up. That its all in my head. My one and only serious relationship was with a boy online. It started when I was 14. Went on and off since I was 17. He said he would come to Canada and marry me. We would have an amazing life together and have kids of our own. I was so happy. Everyone around me told me he was mentally abusing me. I did not see it. But he would not let me have friends, he would get insanely jealous. I was not even allowed to go over to my female friends house, and when I did, he would get super angry. He controlled everything in my life. Got upset when I went to school and did not stay home to talk to him. Eventually he left me for one of my other friends online. I begged him to stay, I had never felt so broken. He did not. he would say awful things about me. The anxiety and depression got so bad I could not go to school. By this time, I was in grade 12. Every time I walked in the school, I had a panic attack. could not be around people. I tried online school, I could not do it. It was too difficult without a teacher. I still have not graduated. I have never had a job- its hard to leave my house. I cannot drive. I cannot cook. I cannot do anything by myself, my mother raised me to be super dependant. 3 years ago she started dating a guy (now fiance) she previously was best friends with. He was around me a lot when I was a child. I do not remember much. The meds make me forget most of my life including my school years. First couple years were fine. I eventually got really sick. Last year I developed severe ocd. Contamination ocd. I cannot touch anything he has touched. cannot have him in my apartment. My mother gets angry and blames me that she cannot be happy. I have tried 3 different meds since then, all the free therapists the government gives me. Nothing helps. They say I developed ocd as I most likely have psychological issues with men because of all the wrong they have caused me in my life. My family all acknowledges I need professional psychological help. They do not have the money for it. My mom is on permanent medical assistance as she has severe stage 4 endometriosis. My dad lives with his girlfriend who has kids, they cannot afford me or take me in either. My grandparents just want to live a chill retired life. They do not want me. My brother lives in a different province. This takes me to why I need to get out of here, though I have no place to go. Last night my mom got upset with me and said she wants her life back. she is sick of my mental illnesses and says she is going to have her fianc over. She acts like she forgets that I nearly starved to death last year, literally days away from starving, because I was too scared that what she cooked was contaminated because she was around him. The ambulance was called at my therapists office because he saw that I could barely stand up. I was shaking really bad. I was extremely malnourished. I was not able to shower for the same fear that she contaminated the shower. Again last year my mother called the police on me because I said I did not want to live anymore after she had threatened our relationship if he does not come over. She said that she would not watch movies with me anymore or be around or spend time with me at all (which really affected me because she was like my only friend. do not have barely any irl bc of my anxiety to leave the house and she knows this). Everyone I do talk to says that she emotionally abuses me so bad. I have a video of her saying that our relationship is nothing now anyways. This week she said she was going to lock me out of the fridge for getting a piece of balongne. She said that I have gluten on my hands (she has celiac) even though I did not even touch anything with gluten, and she said that I am probably the reason why she is been sick this past year. She wants to move in with her fianc, and I am the one holding her back. She always makes sure to let me know that I am the reason why she cannot have happiness in her life. She makes me feel like I am just a roadblock. And so much more. So when the police were called they came into our small apartment - 4 men. They forced the blood pressure machine on me even though I was crying telling them its contaminated. They told me to grow up and act like an adult. They told me that since they have been called twice now, that next time they are called they can put me in handcuffs and arrest me. It traumatized me so much. The self harm last year was out of control. Since that year I have gotten so much better by myself since my mother had been cooperating with me, giving me time to get better before she has her fianc over. I do not wear gloves inside my house anymore. I can eat. I can shower. I do not self harm. I have been socializing online a lot. However last night when she said she was going to start having him over I have fallen into some of the same habits. have not really been eating. Been super depressed. Been crying and shaking all day. I am scared it will be as bad as last year - probably way worse if he comes over. Hell contaminate everything just by being in here. I am so scared. I will not be able to leave my closed room. Ill be too afraid to eat or drink anything in fear of it being contaminated. I am so so scared. cannot stop shaking. Threw up after I tried to eat something. Last year I nearly died, I do not know what worse entitles. I am scared. I made so much progress. I do not want it all to be shattered. It will all be for nothing if she has him over. She will not let me get psychological help first either before she has him over. She says she cannot afford it and she is waited long enough. Shaking while typing this. Feel really sick. Stopped talking to my friends. Stopped doing anything except sitting in my room crying. She keeps threatening me that she will call the police again if I do not start eating. She says they will arrest me this time. But I feel so sick. I am so scared. No one can afford help for me. I cannot do anything. I am stuck. What do I do? I have psychological issues with men yet my mom is going to bring a man in the house. I am so scared. She does not care. I have tried reaching out to him personally and our family. No one cares. They all think I am being irrational. And that my mom deserves happiness too. They do not understand. No one does. And I am trapped. All I am is a roadblock. No one wants me. No one can take me. I am trapped in this home. It used to be the only place I feel safe, now its the scariest place. All I do is sleep because its the only time I am at peace. I cry every time I wake up because I realize I have to face this hell. I am trapped. I am scared. I have nowhere to go. What can I even do? I cannot drive to get out of here. I cannot do anything. cannot get a job to afford professional psychological help for myself. I am stuck. And its so so so scary. What can I even do? Throwaway - I need help, advice, anything. I am stuck.",Depression
10752,"I am not sure if this is the right sub for this question but I figure some people here may have direct experience with it. If not, apologies.I have a friend who I talk to online. He had a suicide attempt last year and his one experience with mental health professionals, besides staying in a holding facility, was a handful of telephone therapist appointments because of COVID. These, unsurprisingly, were not helpful sessions and his very first introduction to therapists, and he is very easily swayed by negative first impressions.Since then, things improved for a while but now I can tell he is getting worse again and talking about his suicidal ideations frequently again. I am there for him, try to avoid being judgmental or saying any of the platitudes that would make him feel guilty or like I do not understand the severity of his situation. But in the end I know he would stand to benefit from talking to a therapist in person the most. The thing is I do not know how to guide him to this idea without pushing him away from it. I gently mentioned it in our last serious conversation and got an appreciative but seemingly dismissive response. I feel like if I push too hard he is going to feel guilty or like it is yet another societal pressure to fix himself bearing down on him. But he is said he pretty much has no hope for a therapist to help at this point and mentioned therapists not being helpful for anyone else in his life, so those walls are pretty high up at the moment. With his history I feel stressed about the potential for him spiral again, and I would definitely feel guilty if I did not push hard enough in that case.

10759,"I have only ever tried to off myself once and that was 6 months ago. Now I am feeling worse than I did back then. I want to die. I hate myself and I just hate living. I have to constantly be worrying if I am going to have a sudden mood swing and do something stupid that I will not be alive to regret later. I do not care about how selfish it is, they all find it as some sort of fucking joke even after having to rush me to the hospital themselves. Whenever I think about pills I want to throw up, but lately, that has not been happening. The moment I am comfortable enough to take pills without immediately throwing up I am going to do it. I do not even care if I do not die. I honestly liked the feeling of being high off pills, and if I die? that is just the extra benefit. I do not see why I need to try stopping myself. what is there to live for? I hate people, I am an asshole so I do not care what they think of it. My life is fine, but I hate being alive and having to go through this. Even If I was not depressed I still do not see the reason why I would want to live. When I tried to off myself my parents both thought it was because I have a low self-esteem (I am not even overweight why would I kill myself just bc I do not like how I look??) but neither of them even took into consideration that it might be their faults. My dad used to beat the shit out of me before he got cancer 2 years ago, and my mom would just get drunk and leave me and my brothers standing outside for 2 hours waiting for her to pick us up just to find out she was not coming. Everyone on my mom's side of the family is an alcoholic, so I am pretty much fucking destined to become one too. There are so many things I have to worry about in the future so why do I need to fucking wait longer? 90% of the people I talk to just tell me to see a therapist. What the fuck is talking going to do to solve my problems?? I am sleep-deprived, I am eating like 700 calories a day, I do not remember the last time I actually took care of myself. I should just down some energy drinks and go for a run, give myself a damn heart attack. I should stay awake for as many days straight as possible and give myself really bad dark circles, then my parents cannot say they did not know I was not doing good. But no, I will probably just start ignoring my depression again after it calms down enough, and eventually I will break and end up dead. What a fun life I am living. what is the point",Depression
10760,"Not sure, it will probably pass but I have been dealing with depression for years, went through periods of medicating but I have been off medication for 5-6 years now. I know they are all kind of different but I tried a few and it was not really for me (not saying I will not try again) I have gone from someone who does not shower/look after themselves in any way to someone who is in their 3rd year of uni and nearly has a skincare routine (nearly). I know it is good, but I feel like no matter how much water I drink, how well I do in class, how often I brush my teeth, I cannot help crashing and burning every couple of weeks with everything turning to absolute shit. All it takes is a tiny thing and I feel fucked, I do not want to do anything. I feel like the universe is against me, like I am really trying soo hard and things are going wrong that are just stupid. Like random shit, I feel like for every step up I take, life's trying to push me back down and I just feel really tired and like, what is the point. I know the point is to keep going and better myself and learn to manage my emotions better and all that, go back to therapy, consider medication, but I really just feel like shit and that it is not going to change anything sometimes. Has anyone struggled much with diagnosis? I got diagnosed with anxiety and depression in my teens (I am 24 now, female) and I was kind of wondering, almost hoping that my diagnosis was wrong so I could start on a path that would actually get me somewhere. Maybe it is just like a pipe dream but has anyone here tried to deal with their depression for years before finding out it was something else? Or a combination?

10762,"I am not sure what I am hoping to gain from this. Perhaps a friend or some perspective that I have as of yet failed to muster. To shorten a long story I am an early thirties single dad who struggles greatly with depression and suicidal ideation.I have a daughters and she has saved my life up to this point and I love her to death. And yes I am already aware that the gift of a child should be enough in itself. It makes me hate myself for still struggling with the darkness of depression. However this darkness existed long before my daughter and has consumed me for years. I have always been the loner type. Extremely introverted, a homebody, and incredibly socially awkward. I have struggled to connect with people and make friends my entire life. Outside of my daughter I feel entirely alone. The depression is like a cancer that eats me from inside. Its never ever gone, just easier to cope with rarely but occasionally. But I can always feel it consuming me and eating away at my resolve and its slowly breaking me.I also struggle with finding purpose outside of strictly the parent life. I struggle with the monotony of life and routine. I do not even feel alive most of the time, just like I am going through the motions like a menial robot. I often sit in restless anticipation hating that I am doing nothing but can think of nothing I specifically want to do. I constantly find myself thinking that there has to be more to life than this. At the same time there is a voice that echoes in my head what a piece of shit I am for not finding my daughter alone to be enough to have passion for life. That same voice echoes thoughts of self harm and the release it could bring like playing devils advocate in my own mind. I know it makes me sound crazy and its just me hyping myself in my own head but its been becoming harder to shut those thoughts out. The darkness feels like its getting deeper and I feel like I am suffocating in the moment. I am struggling to shut it down. I often cry myself to sleep or stare into darkness for hours. I hide everything from my daughter because I do not want to put such burden on her. But I think she still suspects at times when it can be written on my face no matter how hard I try to be subtle. I do not turn to alcohol or drugs but it still feels like drowning as of late. I cannot continue to go on like this but I do not know where to go from here. I have dabbled in therapy and meds without success. And you cannot just snap your fingers and make yourself NOT a socially awkward nervous wreck. I feel like an alien freak, like something was majorly screwed up in the assembly process of my creation and I must be broken.TL;DR: Single dad struggling to overcome depression and feel satisfied with life. Just another one lost in the world.",Depression
10766,"Hello. First post ever on reddit(I think)Sorry in advance for this banter, but I do not feel like I can tell my friends about this nor do I want to post this where any fanily member can see. I am going to get straight to the point. I sometimes just want to die. Let me start by telling you abit about myself.I had a pretty though childhood growing up, my dad commited suicide when I was 5, and my mother remarried a man who was very abusive towards me and my siblings. She later divorced him when I was 17.I am nie 24 years old, never been in any serious relationships, not as lovers nor as friends. Still a virgin(not that it bother me much). I just want to make this clear, I am not exactly unatractive I think. I am pretty tall, strong jawline, pretty muscular and heavily tatted also I have a talent for music. But I do not feel like any of that matters. Call me narcissistic if you like, but it is the truth. The reason I say it does not matter is because it does not. Alot of people feel like if they look good they will be happy, but that is completely false, atleast in my case. The reason I want do die is because nothing I ever do makes me feel fullfilled. Once I pick something up I usually stick with it for a while and tend to develop a talent for it, but usually end up dropping it as I do not feel any fullfilment from it. I cannot develop any romantic interest for anyone, nor form any real connections. I just really want to day dream and live in my own world. The fantasy world I created feels like my sactuary. that is why I want to die sometimes. I do not know how or when but somewhere down the line I convinced myself that when I die I will live in the universe I created inside my head. I do not know why I have not killed myself yet. Maybe because friends and family will be sad, may have because my cat will be left alone(which is what I care the most about in this world). It feels like I am just waiting for a meaningful event that will bring joy to my life which will never happen. Any one else feel like this? Anyways, sorry for making you read this drunken useless banter. Have a nice day I sometimes want to die.",Suicidal

I did not have a bad social life either there was no bullying in my school, I had good at social interactions with my peers and teachers, and had a great rapo with them. My father came from nothing and achieved everything himself. I feel a pressure to out do him but nobody is telling me to do so. I have screwed up my life academically, I never had to work hard to achieve anything, I was good at sports and academics but slowly as competition started to increase i gave up on things and retreated. I started consoling myself that somehow I am destined to be sucessful and I started to belive it. Everytime I sleep, I hope I do not wake up tomorrow or if I do wake up , I wake up when i was 13 yrs old so I can re do my life with the current wisdom. Everytime my family goes out on vacation I hope they do not come back (die) so I can have an excuse for the failure I will become in future.

About 6 months ago I decided it was time to venture forward and open up my own Mobil barbershop.

I accomplished my task, and created a beautiful shop. Now I have been waiting on my freelance license and my plates and registration for my bus. Since the beginning of the month. The truth is though, I have not been able to bring myself to go turn in the paperwork to get the process started. I have completely backslid to who I was before I became a father, and a barber. I do not see the point in utterly anything. Even if I know that it will better my life I cannot bring myself to rarely even leave the house anymore.

I often struggle with feelings if depression like there is no reason to live, but I do not think of killing myself because I am too afraid of death.Now it is not like I do nothing with myself, I do a lot, but I do a lot in order to waist time and keep myself from feeling alone or bored. I work 2 part times jobs, one at whole foods, and the other at a physical therapy office. Tbh my main reasons for working are not even the money it is to do something. I also train baseball players 3 times a week for 1.5 hours. I also workout 5-6 days a week, and go on walks when I can. I also study Japanese, and study different scientific topics in my free time, and I occasionally make youtube videos. I do a lot, but I still feel incomplete. I still feel like I have no direction in life because I do not know what I truly want to do. I am afraid to commit to anything. Also, I have trouble talking to people especially women. I am so incredibly shy and sick of not being be able to talk to girls. I also do not really care for hanging out with friends. I occasionally go out, but really only so my parents will not say anything to me about not being social. I started a YouTube channel tbh in the hopes of making a career off of it. But within weeks I lost the desire and care for making videos. I still make videos, but do not really care. I think I was driven to make videos in the hopes of fame, because I frequently compare myself to YouTube stars who are the same age as me and already have their life seemingly figured out. I work out, and struggle with body dysmorphia. I constantly think of myself as fat or small, and am never satisfied with myself. I compare my strength to people on the internet and end up feeling insecure af. Even those motivational videos where a guy with a missing leg is doing squats or something makes me feel bad. I think to myself he has 1 leg and I can barly do that.I work to fill time. I work at physical therapy office to get experience because I have thought of becoming one, but tbh I am not that interested. I just cannot think of anything else to do with my life.

10834,"I have only 1 person I can somewhat open to but I have only done so to a certain extent and try to refrain from doing it at all for the most part. I feel guilty as if I am bothering them with unfairly dumping my bullshit onto them and as if I am doing it for attention or pity. I honestly have no clue how long this will end up being. Whether this story grosses you out, makes you hate me, or even if you choose not to read it, everything is fine with me. It does not really have a point. I just felt like Id never actually let my thoughts out properly and so this is my trashbin.Was raised in a single mother household and never knew my father. Mother divorced him for being psychotic and threatening not only her life but the lives of his children as well. This was after years of her holding out believing it was her duty to sacrifice herself to let her children have a financially stable home with 2 parents. We ended up in a very low class town with minimal income but my mother worked herself to the bone with low paying jobs in an attempt to make sure we still had as good of a life as she could make. Unfortunately I still ended up being a weird kid. Not really sure why but I have always wondered if I had a disorder that was simply never noticed and properly diagnosed. I know now though that I have severe anxiety problems which were hereditary. She spent every last ounce of her strength just trying to provide for the family so she had very little left over to actually raise the children. Once I got into the public elementary school my weirdness ended up with me never developing any connections. Eventually there was severe bullying. I would never paid any attention to it till my most recent years when I started to reflect on why I am the way I am now, but I know that some of it definitely mentally changed me in very not good ways. Though all these years I never thought of it as such. For what I believe was the reason above I ended up dropping out of the school system after at least a year of problems. The biggest was me refusing to go to school by faking epileptic seizures as a way to get out. I actually had epilepsy but all of the ""seizures"" I ever had at school were fake. The final nail in the coffin was 1 particularly violent bully beating the shit out of me and stomping my head into the concrete pavement for almost a minute like he was playing dance dance revolution at an arcade. Teacher was too scared to physically stop him I guess? Stayed out of the system for like 3-4 years while the public school shut down. We live in an extremely economically dead town. Like the majority of the towns roughly 1000 population are under the 10k annually mark (including us) and barely survive solely off government benefits and the low cost of living. That was when I first started to seclude myself off. It was not terrible but at the same time I had no real social connections. I did things like go on occasional outings with family members and such but I had no friends or social groups at all. Eventually I started to really dive into my playstation 2 and slowly started sticking there more and more as time went on. My grandparents both finally fell down ill due to old age. My grandmother developed parkinsons and my grandfather went through several bad falls as well as slowly developing dementia. This was an unbearably huge amount of stress on my mother who was already being torn apart by how hard she was struggling to keep the household up. Eventually she decided to sacrifice her job in exchange for taking up the home healthcare position of taking care of my grandparents. With this she would work literally next door to us, be able to take care of her parents when no one else in the family would, and she would still make an income. It was shaky but things were still fine back then. Around the age of 11 or so (bad memory of things back then) she decided to pay a heavy amount of money to put me back into school. There was a VERY small little private school in town that was run by an older gentleman named Mr. G, 3 teachers, and maybe a total student body of 25 or so children in various grades split between those 3. 2 of them were very nice older women named Miss D and then my teacher named Miss N,. I guess I had problems with anxiety but eventually I managed to be somewhat happy. Unfortunately the third teacher, Miss P who was the daughter of Miss D, was a very difficult person. She had extreme anger issues, seemed to just dislike children as a whole, and had absolutely no patience for anyone who lacked. Miss N was a much more Elderly woman than the other 2 and at some point she became far too ill to continue her teaching job. The remaining kids were mostly moved to Miss P's class with the only exceptions being the much younger children in the lower grades. Every single day was a living hell for me. The simplest way to describe it is that she held extreme animosity towards the weaker kids. If you were falling behind in the pace of your work, or if you were not producing grades that she was happy with, or if you did not understand something, she just hated you. When you did something like this she would threaten you, scream at you, talk to you like she was about to physically beat the shit out of you, oftentimes not so subtly threatening to actually do so. She used intimidation like standing directly above you in your seat and silently glaring you down. it would be even worse when she would bend down and put herself right in your face and start with her threatening. Or she would take a heavy book and slam it in front of you. There were at least 2 kids that definitely had learning problems, like a young little blonde boy named Tyler. The poor kid would often be the last to finish his work, or maybe it was even a group of 3 of us. she would slam her hand down on her desk in the corner, look at us like she was about to kill us, and then tell us in the most threatening manner that she could muster ""Get it down NOW"". The school had a physical discipline policy that was based on parental permission. she would often take Tyler somewhere to beat his ass with a belt when he was not performing like she wanted. The other method she used a lot was what I liken to a military ""shark attack"". she would take the student to a separate part of the school, plop them down in a chair, and start shouting in their face. She berated them on why they cannot do what she wants them to do, why they cannot do it fast enough, why cannot you understand this or that when you should be able to understand it, and when some poor kid can only respond with ""I do not know"" she just lays on harder. She always told us that we CAN do it how she wants but we are just lazy or do not want to do it. Or that our parents did not raise us properly.The principal, Mr G, apparently knew about some of this but Miss D did her best to protect her daughter. Some of the parents would become aware of this and many different students over the years would get taken out because they could not handle Miss P. Miss D was honestly a nice and good hearted person but I guess she simply loved her daughter and did not want to see her fired. I still do not know to this day how the school had not been hit with any legal problems but maybe what she was doing was not considered abuse or anything.Eventually history repeated itself and I continued to miss more and more school. I would wake up hours before it was time to leave for school because I was terrified of going and could not sleep. A lot of times I would cry on the way there and beg my mother to not force me to go. I think I had a hard time explaining to her why I hated school so much. She knew the teacher was causing issues but was not sure of what to do. Because she was soft she would let me skip school pretty often on days like that, but she was also pressed as she was paying the school a huge fee monthly for me to go, I was losing a lot of school work due to missing everything, and she was also legally pressed as there was a child law stating that you could not miss so many days of school. Finally after so long of it she mentally could not handle juggling my problematic school life and her other responsibilities so she pulled me out. I was labeled as being homeschooled so we were legally safe but I never touched a single bit of homeschooling work at all. Same situation as before. I had not managed to build any relationships with people and had no connections to social groups. I went back to my little room and continued to play video games. As the years went by I became more and more secluded and slowly degenerated as a person. Stopped interacting with even my family members, stopped leaving the house for days at a time, stopped interacting with my mother, stopped interacting with the house, ect. Then came things like neglecting my basic hygiene, neglecting my responsibility to assist with the household, ect. I am not worried about revealing this as I can remain anonymous but I believe my hygiene and standard of living was probably far below what most people could imagine. At the worst points of it I could have gone a month or over without bathing and years without brushing my teeth. My room had become a literal vile trash heap filled with soda cans, junk, dishes, and rotting food. How I never contracted some horrific disease is beyond me, and somehow I came out with a perfectly healthy set of teeth despite horrible yellowing. Through it all my mother destroyed herself trying to deal with me as a life sucking parasite living in the back of her house and her slowly dying parents that were succumbing to old age and terrible illnesses. I sat by staring at my computer screen, having basically no human interaction with anyone and even amongst online groups still being a weirdo that never got along with people, not paying attention to both her and the house falling apart. Even in my little computer world I was not satisfied though. I still do not understand a lot about myself but I believe I sought out video games as a form of fulfillment as I have nothing else. I looked towards competitive games or extremely grind heavy games as a way of feeling like I could accomplish something and feel like I had worth. Unfortunately I quickly learned that I was pretty mediocre at these things as well. Even if I could happily play a game 10, 12, 14 hours a day I still could not succeed how others could. I started to learn very quickly that regardless of what I dived into I was also lacking. I believe this led to my complex of believing that I am incapable of doing anything at all. Somewhere at around the age of 18 I got some awareness and finally realized where I would gone. Spent all of those years thinking ""No way I could end up like this. that is impossible."" and then suddenly I open my eyes and I am already there. Seen my husk of a mother dealing with a dysfunctional family, both from her children and her siblings. Seeing everything I would loved as a child decayed and gone. I had a cousin named Jeff and his father named Sammy who I loved more than anyone else when I was a kid. When I was much younger Jeff died after a life fighting against cancer which left his father and mother broken. Instead of trying to connect with my uncle which could have done us both good I instead spent my time shutting myself off from my family, and eventually he also passed away from a broken heart and crippling illness. I cannot tell you how much I regret that. In 2017 my grandfather finally passed away from his problems, and then about 1 year later my grandmother followed after him. That was the end of my mothers employment and thus any income we had. Her mental state was destroyed by the years of stress and then the loss of her parents, and she was already in her 50's on top of being physically worn out so even if she wanted to try she was no longer fit for work. I was a pile of shit with mental issues who could not even interact with people properly anymore much less join the workforce. What little education I started out with had been completely forgotten and I forget how to even write. I can still write letters but there is almost no way I could handle anything past a few simple words. I only relearned how to write my name in cursive because I had to start filling out my own paperwork in hospitals and such. I never actually remembered or possibly even learned how to use proper grammar and punctuation. What I am doing now is only from me copying what I see other people do and trying to figure out how it is used from there. I have tried self learning things in the past but I get overwhelmed and it feels like I cannot grasp anything no matter what I try. We spent the next several years in financial hell. Begging friends and family for money where we can just to keep utilities and internet on, of course using government programs for things like food stamps. There were plenty of times where we would lose electricity or water anyway as there is a limit to begging and what others can do to help you when they are struggling with their own lives. Our relatives in Texas were a bit more successful and it was in large part thanks to them that we even managed at some points. Even still we have had situations where we lived without water for months before, electricity for weeks, ect. We also managed to rack up a utility debt to the town which is where we would lose the water a lot. It was due to an error on their part where they failed to shut off our gas line and thus charged us for utilities we did not use. We were constantly hit by struggle after struggle but life continued on. Somewhere along the way I developed a back disability. It could have been hereditary, it could have been a random occurrence, or it could have been a result of my terrible lifestyle. I do not know the answer. At first it was not anything major but it slowly progressed to be worse and worse as time went on. After so long we started to piece things back together through a few different methods. Specifically we relied on a deposit that originally belonged to my grandparents but my family handed it over to us since we needed money the most. Then my grandfather's precious car that had decayed away in his garage was also sold. This money at least helped us for a few months until we finally managed to get more government assistance and deal with the town. We managed to get a program that pays for our electricity and then got the town to ignore the debt of our water bill for the time being while we pay a small amount every month to keep it on. Eventually though I started to crack. Over the years I refused to swallow the notion of depression. I had lived my entire life by having my mother take care of me, sacrificing herself to deal with me even though she should not have. I had not changed my ways much but I started to develop a mentality that I did not deserve anything from anyone, especially not the right to be depressed. I would have moments where it would creep up on me, but I would throw it away and ignore it. However time went on and the guilt only piled up. I could not change my ways or do anything to change my life. I am nothing but a burden and I cannot change it. The fact that I would always revert back to my ways and the fact that years went by without any sort of change killed me so much. Then one day about a year ago I watched a motivational video from an old man who started from a truly low position in life. He was a bright and strong old guy who tried to convince the younger generation that they can do it and that he understands that life is hard for people in these times, maybe even harder than it was in his. I watched a few of his videos and the only thing I could think was ""I am nothing like this person. I cannot be as strong as this person. I cannot change my life like this person. I am sorry for failing."". that is when I first started hurting myself. was not anything major. Was an old pocket knife and I did not aim deep. And you know? It felt good. Not in a physical way of course. I would been taking so many painkiller/muscle relaxer pills that I did not feel much. However I would always thought that I could not even commit suicide if I wanted to because I would be too weak to even endure the pain or have the guts enough to because it. But those few cuts proved me wrong. I could do it and it was pretty easy, and that made me happy. For about a week I would continue making cuts here and there just to continue reaffirming that feeling of accomplishment. I just passed the cuts off as my huge cat losing his marbles and attacking my arm. Since I would never really interacted with my mother much and never allowed myself to show any sort of symptoms of depression she did not even begin to suspect anything else. But then an argument happened. It was something stupidly simple. I had a pack of meat that I wanted to take out of the freezer to defrost, but it was 2 separate packs joined in the middle by tough plastic. I could not separate it and lazily threw the entire thing into the fridge to defrost. My mother stopped me and proceeded to lecture me about how I always waste so much food and I got annoyed. I just grabbed the meat and was going to chuck it back into the freezer for another time but then she got pissed at that as well and jerked it out from in front of me and started telling me how I am always so childish, impatient, lazy, and ""I am beginning to think that you will never change"". This one little line broke something. I thought to myself ""She also understands that I am worthless and that I will never change or become better"". It was like I knew that she knew the entire time but hearing it and thus confirming it is an entirely different thing for me. Even though I of course knew that is not what she meant I could not help but think about these things. I quietly slinked off into my room like I normally do but once I was behind a closed door and was not being bothered I silently broke down. I cried, I laughed at myself, and then I started cutting more. This time was harder. I was angry at myself with how fucking pathetic and disgusting and how much of a soul sucking worm I was. After a few larger cuts than normal I really broke down and finally started going for real deep wounds.Then I looked out of the corner of my eye and noticed an old fish fillet knife on my desk. I enjoy knives as a hobby so I had a lot of different stuff scattered around my room. I took it, thought about what sort of damage I could deal with it, and I was happy at the thought. To avoid explicit details I ended up with 4 deep gashes. I was not sure if I was necessarily thinking of committing suicide with that or not. I almost wanted it but I also avoided cutting directly on the wrist and also remained aware the entire time that I knew a better method to ensure it would work if I committed to it. I did not feel much of anything, maybe not even the slightest burn. could have been adrenaline, could have been the pain meds, could have been both. However as I sat there for a while breaking down further and further while I continued to bleed badly the thought crossed my mind that I could have actually done potentially fatal damage. I never really had a plan to begin with for hiding such massive cuts but they were far beyond the point of just wrapping them up and pretending it was nothing. that is when my legs gave out, my vision blurred, I became ultra light headed, and my arms and hands became extremely numb while tingling super hard. Id suddenly got scared and thought that I might have killed myself somehow. I stumbled to the front of the house and showed my mother what happened. Told her I loved her and was sorry for failing her and then just sat down on the kitchen floor and just kind of blurred out from there. A nearby off duty EMT rushed over and took a look. Nothing fatal as the knife had been dulled over the years without me knowing but stitches were definitely needed so she patched me up as best as she could and I was rushed to a hospital in a far off city. Closest city could not accept me due to covid or something so I ended up going to a larger but further away city. Mother cried so much on the way there and she was absolutely traumatized. Ended up saying goodbye to her at the hospital entrance and then sat in a holding cell for what was probably about 3-4 hours. Went through the process of getting patched up and once day break hit I got shipped off to a mental facility nearby. I spent about a week there. I had more human interaction in that 1 week than I had in the entire 10 years leading up to that point, and most of it was me silently sitting in the corner. Despite that though the facility was not worth anything at all and I am still not sure how people are cured there. Maybe it was a holding facility and not an actual hospital but I do not know and never cared to know. It was just a depressing common room where everyone just sat around in uncomfortable chairs, drank decaffeinated coffee, and tried their best to sleep through the day until they were allowed to go back to their rooms for the night. Met some interesting characters. The people in there ranged from people with major disorders, to people in drug remission, people coming off an alcohol trip, and even something like anger problems. Got to meet a gorgeous young hood girl named Audrey who I instantly developed a crush on and also got to experience what it was like having a roommate even if I absolutely hated it. Was picked up by my mother and uncle after my week was up and really had not received any sort of help or counseling. Id felt like an entirely different person though just finally being around people and even briefly opening up about myself to a few people around me. Had some sort of psychiatrist call center try to help me afterwards but all it amounted to was a group of random people who I formed no connection to calling me up whenever they felt like it to ask me if I was ok and if I needed any more meds. I was probably at fault since Id already had a hard time opening up but I felt even less inclined when it was someone I did not care about or know over the phone. Suddenly for a short bit I had family members swarming around and feeling like they had to somehow help me. Was given my first cellphone as I had not ever needed nor wanted one previously, and not but maybe a few weeks later my cousin contacted me to tell me he wanted me to work a part time job. Its really low hours which works in my favor with my disability and its a simple cleaning job so I can pick it up so easily. I thought of this as a first step that would hopefully give me a mentality that I can do better and I can be of use to people. The money is next to nothing but for the first time in years we do not have to ask someone for assistance the moment we need even the smallest of things. Can keep basic household items around, keep my pets fed, try to keep bills paid, ect. After about 2 or so months I turned towards fixing my back. If my legs recover from the severe muscle pains I experience when walking then I could hold a full time job with good pay and from there its just a slow process of building myself up. The ineptitude I feel, the lack of education that haunts me, the disability that holds me back, all of it could be fixed with some time. I felt so happy and it was such a new feeling that I had not felt in so long. that is when everything quickly came caving in. So far my doctors and related medical procedures were all moving at a crawl. I spent several years dealing with a doctor that had to be demanded to move through several visits before they would actually do something, and I repeatedly kept getting thrown back and forth between tests and random crap. I ended up in physical therapy several times but that never amounted to much because apparently government health insurance does not afford particularly quality or motivated therapy sessions. That went nowhere fast and so Id spent the years up until that point just hopped up on a high dose of painkiller/muscle relaxers. However all of a sudden everything sped up real damn quick. There was immediate discussion about consulting a neurosurgeon which we spent a while trying to find due to not only the limitations on what the state had available but also what we could find with our insurance. Dumb doctor seemed optimistic and told me it should be easily treatable. Finally got to meet my neurosurgeon for the first time and he was even more optimistic. He spun a tale of how so damn easy and quick it would be to fix a busted disc and that even if the back pain was not 100% cured there was no way he could not fix it up so that my legs were not fine again. Said everything was a guaranteed easy operation. So on my very first consultation due to my naivety and stupidly thinking I could trust doctors I agreed to a surgery. Short version of that is several shady things happened with that doctor and after about a month or 2 of recovery I could safely say that not only had the surgery failed but I was not at least 2 or 3 times worse off than I was previously. Now that were later into 2021 I have been told after a follow up visit that the disc is no longer salvageable and the damage may yet get worse as there are signs that more discs will degrade and blow out in the future. A surgery to potentially stop the problem from worsening has been suggested but all of his previous enthusiasm is gone and he believes there is a good chance the rest of my discs will go bad regardless of what happens. For now I am taking more pain meds than before just trying to keep my little job together but who knows when that will start to fail as well. In that time span of my cutting incident to now I rose up higher than Id been in years only to fall lower than Id ever been before mentally. Things like my hygiene have gotten to acceptable levels. I still have anxiety about so many things that eat away at me on a daily basis but I have gotten better at talking to people even if I cannot manage to build social connections. But I have completely lost hope of ever escaping poverty, ever having a body that is not too weak to do what I want, trying to build a normal social life and make up for all those years I wasted, or even escaping from behind my little computer screen. Any time I try to think about it, or when someone tells me what I should be doing, somewhere along in that plan that I am cooking up I reach a roadblock that stems from something of these 3 issues. I have come to hate everything about myself and where I am at now. Even if I try to explain it away I still blame myself for ending up like this. Suicide seems to be the only thing I can think about now as I have lost all form of motivation to even do the things that I once enjoyed. I am simply trying to pass through each day until hopefully I hit another emotional breakdown that will give me the push I want to overcome everything else and just end it. Rather than wasting my time and spending my entire life self loathing and living like this I decided that if nothing changes by the time I am 25 in 2 more years Ill resolve myself to end it if I do not do it sooner. Venting and dumping my story here if that is fine. it is ok if it needs to be removed for whatever reason.",Suicidal
10838,"Hey! So I am trying to get better at life. Eating better, exercising, actually doing uni classes, learning French/chess, gaming less, etc. The issue is that I started so far back from normal that I am still pretty pathetic, especially on the uni front. For context, I come from a very accomplished family. Not going to go into detail but my siblings are all geniuses. In jr high Id get 85s and even 90s on a report card and still be somewhat disappointing. Eventually I decided to just stop trying. Currently trying to reverse that. More context: last October I was very depressed and struggled with suicidal ideation. I have been tracking the number of hours I work each semester for a while and that semester I calculated it to an average of 0.7 hours a day (5.0 = 40 hr work week). I got help and got on some meds. Now I am at 2.1 hours a day (uni)+ learning French + chess + reading + exercise. I know its still really bad but I have basically tripled my output and I am proud of myself for that. I tried sharing my improvement with my family last night and I literally got laughed at. Like I know I am still considered lazy but GOD I am SORRY I WAS BUSY TRYING TO SUPPRESS THE URGE TO KILL MYSELF. It takes a long time (for me at least) to recover from that. I am just pissed that when I share my improvements people snicker. Lack of encouragement",Depression

Because he is someone very strong, he is in control of his emotions, he works out, he eats well, he is healthy in every way and I am just a piece of trash in his life. I am scared of the words ""ok, I am done let us break up"" because that would push me to just end it all. I have no reason to live, my brother keeps smoking weed and trying to make me do it too, my mother is too Ill and absent that without my bf I am just alone, I do not have real friends and I am tired to try hard to stand up and end up being hurt by something over and over again.All I want to do is get black out drunk and drink anxiolitics, but I keep trying to get my shit together. Therapy is not working in any way. I am not sure what advice to ask, I do not want to break up with my bf, he is not a bad person and I just want to stop loosing what I love most.

This past few months I been dealing with a lot so I been honestly trying to ignore my depression and everything that comes with it. So with that said I went over my in laws to pick up so mail and my MIL and I started to talk and I made a stupid mistake to complain about my husband since I literally have no one and it just kind of happened. Now she thinks I am having an affair and she is mad at me I did not say anything that she does not already know. This made me feel horrible about myself and all the feelings I been suppressing came all at once and my suicidal thoughts are worse, I am not going to do it.

I cannot support myself, I have to rely on my partner. All I want in life is the ability to be independent, but it looks like I will never have that.My last friend was driven away because I said something that offended her. I am still not sure why she was upset. I am horribly lonely. My partner and our two birds is all I have. I do not understand why my partner says he loves me. I am completely useless, like a stupid child. I have got nothing going for me.I often think about what I would need to do before ending my life. I would have to re-home my birds and get rid of my things...I would not want to leave everything for my partner to deal with.

10852,"Growing up my brother was insecure about being inferior to me and hated me. He made our parents believe that I was bullying him which is far from the truth I have always loved my bro but he could not help himself.

I did poorly in school starting out and my mom often said that I would be out on the streets if I kept it up.I was a pretty weird kid entering school. I eventually figured out if I was funny people would tend to like me but that is really as deep as my connections ever went. I was molested by a school friend's older brother which is something I have never told another soul. It seems like I have a pattern of people making fun of me and trying to take advantage of me. I am not perfect but I try my best to be kind and accepting of people.That being said I do not have much trust in confiding in or forming new connections. Luckily I have always been pretty resilient. Though I have struggled with substance abuse in the past I am in a pretty good spot now concerning my career and physical health. I even managed to still have a few friends that I occasionally do things with but I still have trouble forming deeper connections.My family life has improved as everyone matured.

Like, I has been really interested in politics since I was younger, and I am clearly leaning one side (left if I have to say...), but I just cannot get over the fact how there are people on both sides that are just nuts, no one wants to hear each other out on the internet and every comment section where disagreement happens becomes an all-out war, where it is impossible to convince anyone to at least consider other side or just respectfully disagree, no the goal is to absolutely obliterate your ""opponent"". I understand that some opinions perhaps should be socially ostracized, but it came to a level that everyone gets offended even if you try to be as balanced as possible, and if you have no opinion, you admit that you are not informed well enough (because apparently now everyone has a PhD in every field), etc. you becomes everyone is enemy, and it it does not only apply to politics, (as an example) I cannot enjoy anything, ""oh you wanted to eat a cake?"" be sure someone comes and tells you how unhealthy it is, oh you wanted to watch some movie? be sure someone on the internet comes and tells you that there are ""bad values"" in it, or something; I understand what they mean but you cannot live in a constant state of paranoia, where everyone is offended by something. Everything is becoming more exclusive, and every group becomes less and less inclusive. I am not saying that I am not guilty of those things, but I try to comfort myself that I try to be at least a bit self-conscious.It came to this that, when I read/watch anything on the internet that is not some funny innocent video, my mental torment becomes impossible to bear, the only thing I am constantly thinking of is smashing my head on the wall with all my might. News - pleas I hope this world will end soon; Comments - even worse. I am just scrolling, scrolling and scrolling, and with every post scrolled I just loose a tiny bit of my sanity, and when you magnify it by the number of scrolled posts, it becomes apparent that I am completely mentally deranged.And my depression usually, simply, makes me unable to do anything else then scroll this god forsaken web, because I do not really get satisfaction from anything, and this internet stockholm syndrom makes me feel at home with this psychic torture.tl;dr - the internet is just a toxic place that I cannot escape.I do not know if it is even a good place to post it (and I will probably delete it, like I usually do...), but it seems like this subreddit is rather friendly, and I apologize for this rant but I wanted to vent out, maybe find comfort if someone feels the same...

10861,I want to have the will to live so badly. So badly it hurts. Recently all I have been thinking about is buying as much dihydrocodeine as i can and washing them down with a bottle of alcohol and just sit on the slide next to my house. If i survive ill go on if i do not well thank fuck. The reason i want to live is literally for my parents and sister. The damage it would because them would probably kill them. They would blame themselves. But the truth is its me. Its my fault. I am the reason i am he way i am. Its unfair on them that i do not want any of this. I wish my family just did not want me or hated me or fucking something so i knew it would not kill them. But knowing they love me makes it impossible to go without thinking about what would happen to them. I wish i could just be normal. I wish i could just find the concept of life even slightly enticing. Just a little so i could have the will to chase a life that i would like. But i do not want it. All I have been thinking about is suicide for so long. I think I am going to try and see what happens. Ill roll the dice. Its not fait on my parents,Suicidal
10862,"Last year, during the UK lockdown, was the very first time I have ever wanted to die. It got so extreme that I came off of the internet for a few days to try to heal. I did not know what caused it. I will probably never find out. But i did heal...slightly. After about 3 days I realised that I did not want to die and my suicidal thoughts were gone almost instantly but the depression was not. I have spent a year feeling nothing but numbness, guilt and anger. Nothing else. I have had to force a laugh for a year. At one point, I tried to reach out for help but because of covid, no one was there for me in school or in the community. And now I have slipped back into my depression it is numb, but it is emotionally draining. I have had to force myself to write (which is the only hobby I can peruse because my other ones are social hobbies) to which I just think 'what is the point?"". I cannot look at my body without feeling sick of the sight. it is hard to get out of bed but when I do, I just sit there and wait. there is nothing to do. Nothing to wait for. Getting in showers or baths has become so difficult that I have resorted to making a timetable of when I need to shower. I cannot be bothered pretending anymore. I am not okay.I cannot reach out for help. My parents will think I am faking it. My friends could not care in the slightest. I do not go back to school until August (which I am dreading). I do not have anyone to turn to. In all honesty, I could not name one person that I would be able to go to for help. I do not want to die but I do not see the point in living. This is a rant more than anything. This is not a sob story. I am sure quite a few people have gone through this same experience. I can just feel myself go downhill with every passing day.

10877,"So basically I know I am a bit insecure person but I try my best to never tell someone about it and pretend that I am fine with it. But I am really too much sad because of the ""jokes"" made by my girlfriend and her male friends. So basically my girlfriend has only male friends and I really do not have any problem with that. So in our friends group too she is the only girl. So me and my girlfriend are in 2 common Instagram Group Chats where she is the only female. So all the other people flirt with her, make jokes and she does not care and even replies to them, around 1 month ago she and her friend intentionally flirted in front of me by saying ""can I come to your bed tonight"" and I ignored it because she always says that they are just ""jokes"". But the next day they intentionally made the same joke again, and this time I told her friend that these jokes are inappropriate and her friend talked to me in a rude way with very abusive words and in the end they said ""we were doing a prank to make you jealous"". This really made me too sad for few days, later she apologized. Now the same things have started again, in one group chat almost everyone is flirting with her, one guy even made a joke about marrying her. In the other group chat, our common friend literally moaned her name in a voice note 3 times and she continued the joke. Then the common friend said to me ""your girlfriend is falling for me and she wants to cheat on you"" in the group chat and she still thinks it is a joke. I already have a low self esteem where I always think that everyone is better than me and when I tell someone this they blame me by saying I am insecure. I am really tired of this, it literally feels like that I am a loser who cannot do anything.Also my girlfriend is too insecure too, when I talk to any girl she taunts me a lot and to everyone ""that is cute"". We had a common female friend in that gc and my girlfriend said ""you need to take my permission before talking to each other"". And everyone thought ""it was cute"" because she is a girl.

10885,"After 24 years of painful existence, it is clear I should have ended things much earlier. I cannot seem to do anything right. My mind has never been happy or at peace, and medications help but have never been a real solution. I have lived off my parents all my life and have never worked a real job. I am always lonely but have never made a move because I know deep down I would make an awful partner. I have not so much as held hands or kissed a girl, and all completely for a lack of trying - a truly pathetic record befitting of a failure like myself.I do not know why I enrolled in nursing anymore. We learn in the classroom to fight for our patients but I have been burned every time I try to. Apparently I do not speak ""like a professional"". This clinical rotation has broken me; next week, I am going to act like the robot they want us to be and get shit done, not spend time actually getting to know the people I am caring for. I have written so many reflections, completed so many learning plans, that I just cannot take failing again at this point. I refuse to try again; if I fail despite my best efforts, I will take it as a message that I am just not meant for this world.My family and few friends will be especially saddened, I know, but I am just so tired. I have stayed this long for their sake, but I think it is time to prioritize myself for once. I cannot bear telling any of them, I hate being a burden. This post is my way to vent and say my goodbyes. I will delete this post if by some miracle I pass; otherwise, I suppose this is farewell. My fingers are shaking right now and I want to cry; I have not planned this far before, but it is long overdue. If you are reading this, take care of yourself, do not waste your time on me.

Especially on reddit of all god damn places. regardless of that, I want to die. for years, the first thought that conceives itself in my mind when I awake is death. I am over it. its especially weird because I know I have happy moments in this life of mine, yet they do not suffice. It makes me upset. I try so hard to survive and push through yet my head just keeps feeling the way it does. I have been through years of therapy, and months of psych ward experience; I still crave death. The thing that breaks my heart the most is that I can recognize my happier moments, yet I still am so unhappy. Normally, I would treat these positive instances as progress, but they are not solely because I am still left with the same emptiness that I had before. Besides all of that, Imma save up some money to hire a hitman on myself.

10889,"I want to leave something like a autobiography here, hoping that it will give context to understand how I feel. I also think it will be nice to look back. So, here goes nothing. I am Doa. I was born in a Middle Eastern country 19 years ago. I grew up in a nice small town with my family. My life was pretty ordinary until I realized that I was into feminine stuff, but thought it was a fetish and kept it to myself until 2019. I searched about gender dysphoria, transexual people etc. and I realized that I was possibly a trans woman. I asked my parents to see a psychiatrist, but did not tell the reason since I was not sure. After few appointments, both of us were sure that I was trans. Then, I came out to my parents, which was a disaster. They told me that I was a monster, threatened me with disowning me and stuff. Also, that was a shitty timing because it was my last year on high school and I was going to take an exam to apply universities. As you would expect, I was feeling terrible and got depressed. Thought about killing myself several times and planned it few times but did not do it. By that time, my dysphoria was also killing me and I was running away from mirrors and cameras. After my 18th birthday, things got a little bit better. My parents stopped dealing with me and I found that studying non-stop was a good way to run away from my problems. Few months later, my exam went pretty good and I got accepted to one of the best universities in the country, which gave me hope about life. I was thinking by myself ""okay, what can I lose by fighting a little bit more?"". That was a year ago. In the last year, things got even better I can say. Since my university was progressive, everyone was nice towards me, my parents were fully accepting and I even started to look in mirrors after 1.5 years of misery. Then I got rhinoplasty, completed the preparatory year and here I am. Now you might ask ""What are you complaining about?"". I mean, I feel like I should not complain. Even though that I have not got a feminine haircut and I wear nothing but joggers and hoodies, people call me ""miss"", I am lucky to have a family like that -especially when you consider that I live in Mddle East- and I am enrolled in a good university. My life seems pretty OK compared to LGBTQ+ around me. However, as the title suggests, I just do not know what I want. I focused on my transition too much that I have no idea other than that I want to be seen as how I feel inside. I just feel like lost? I do not know what I want to study. I do not know where I want to live. I do not know what I want to do for a living. Of course there are things that I know that I would like to do or to have. But most of them are unattainable as I cannot change the past. For the future, I just know that I want to be loved by someone who sees me as how I want to see myself, but I could not find anyone who shares the same feelings, thoughts and stuff with me. So, I am here, feeling all alone, living without a goal or anything. I do not want to feel this way. If I could be a different person, I promise you I would. Not because I want to but because that way maybe I could be a happier person. I do not really know what I want nor what to expect from life",Depression
10892,"I was 12 when I realized I just fucking want to die.In the 10 years since then, there was not a single day that I did not regret just killing myself right back then. Yes, I lived on. But I had already died inside. This sounds so dramatic but it is the best description of things. Anyone around me can see this. Not like anyone would actually care, they probably think I have some mental retardation. Honestly, I probably do. I have not progressed much since then. My personality has not changed significantly, I have not experienced much, anything I did experience felt dull. Like, alcohol. It just raises my heart beat and makes it hard to walk. Or sex, it is nice, but the same way as food is nice. It does not give any meaning to my life. The only exception is mdma, the only thing that has made me feel something in ten years. But anyways, I really just feel like a ghost. Maybe I am, who knows. It would explain a lot of things. I am really just a she will of a person. Like, sorry, I do not mean to one up anyone on depression. But when I hear stories of people that are depressed and just play online games all day or watch netflix, youtube etc. It just reminds me how fucked up I am. Because I have to FORCE myself to do any of those things. Anything that is not lying in bed all day, maybe scrolling through reddit to distract myself. I do not feel like continuing writing this. But anyways, if I did not have a loving mother I would have ended this by now. there is nothing else keeping me here. Anyone other than my mum will do just fine when I am gone. I did not make a difference in anyone's life after all.

I am terrified I am going to go too far with being emotionally unstable that he will not want to be with me anymore.

This was for his job, which did not actually happen when we got their because of covid (It was for a coaching job). Today, A year later, we moved back to our hometown and my old manager said he would hire me back when they need people in my field. So if that could happen my emotions would be sorted out.

And my gf does not seem to care that inside my own head I am dealing with a lot more than looking at cute cats and wanting one. Am I being selfish in not allowing her to get one till i feel better and feel like dealing with it, or is she being selfish by not accepting my desires to hold off?As an aside, we did try adding a second cat from a rescue a couples month ago against my wishes (she begged on her birthday till I caved).

A few examples are she brought me new clothes online, i said ty when she paid and when i went to bed one night, i saw them on my bed and thought 'ill say ty tomorrow night as i will not see her in the morning' but i forgot.I got home from work, went to my room to get changed and saw she made me a pillow so i thought 'ill say ty when i go downstairs' got changed, really needed the toilet and once i finished i forgot.She asked if i wanted a doorstop making, i said no, and on the same day she made the pillow, she made me a doorstop which i did not realise until i went to bed. Thought 'ill say ty tomorrow night' and i forgot.She mentioned these and said that I am ungreatful and i said that i did see them i just forgot to say ty and she said ""its alright, ill just forget to wash your clothes"". that is not forgetting, that is pulling my clothes and only my clothes out the washing machine and not washing them.

I do t brush my teeth- she does not shower. I am always on my phone- so is her partner. I do t do chores around the house properly- she never cleans up the dirt after sweeping or puts her plate in the dishwasher. there is even occasions where she spils my dribk and complains to me cuz i put it there.

10955,"18, M. Let me just get straight into it.For the past 3 months now, every time I pass my window, I am almost 100% certain someone is watching me and it stresses me out and makes me anxious. I feel watched inside my room - almost like people can see through the wall. But it does not stop there. I feel spied by the government every time I use an electronic device and that they are plotting against me. I have blocked my camera with something, which has helped a bit, but I still feel like they are listening to my thoughts through the camera somehow. When I am alone in my room, I sometimes sense another presence. And it does not stop there.I do not trust many of my friends. I believe some of them are masters at manipulation and I am too socially inexperienced to detect it. I 'read' things hidden messages in casual conversations at times. When I say goodbye to them, my first thought is that they are talking behind my back, and it makes me question whether I should stop hanging out with them. Sometimes, it becomes too much, so I end accusing them of manipulation/lies and become aggressive. Of course, they are in complete denial. This is where I start to question whether any of my thoughts are real. I cannot trust my own thoughts, but I do not trust the words of others either. These thoughts pop up every day out of nowhere. They are so intrusive and inescapable that I just want to die because the anguish is unbearable. It is like my thoughts are disturbed and incohesive. I then wake up the next day, unable to recognize any of my beliefs and thoughts from the night before. My thoughts also are not disturbed or incohesive; they are somewhat normal again.FYI, I have been diagnosed with Aspergers and BPD, but this does not resemble any of my diagnoses. I am feeling suicidal because of it and I just got checked out from the psychiatry a week ago after being hospitalized for two weeks. I told them about my paranoia, but they did not really seem to acknowledge it, which I do not get at all. All they gave me is another diagnosis (Aspergers).. I do not know how much I can hold on anymore I do not know how much I can handle anymore",Suicidal
10959,"Back story how I got to where I am. I am 20F and I moved in with my boyfriend a few months ago. Everything was going great until I got depressed again. I could take care of myself properly, could not get myself motivated to do anything, slept in later than I should. And my bf tried to help me in a way I told him time and time again that it would not work. For some reason everytime someone in my life pushes me to do things that I am scared of or have a hard time doing, I just shut down completely. I agree I was pretty terrible to live with. Some days I helped out so much around the house and other days I could not get myself to do anything at all. I also did not have a job because he would not jump start my car because he was so afraid of me crashing my car on purpose (I would not do that). Flash forward to three weeks ago: everything got worse, we started fighting constantly. He told me I should have tried harder and he was right. He said it was killing him to see me like this. He said if I did not get myself fixed or start doing more for myself that hell kick me out. So I slowly started to do more and take care of myself. However, we still fought constantly. I still could not get him to realize how I felt the way I do and could not get him to start my car. So with that being said I still could not get a job and he hated that. Flash forwarded again, last night he packed up all of my things and kicked me out. The entire time telling me he felt so bad for doing this but it all my fault. Then he got moody and told me that until I get better that we can only be friends. So I was crying hysterically and could not drive myself back to my parents so, he had to take me home. I had a bad panic attack to the point I could not breathe and my whole body was all locked up joint wise. Took him a bit to realized that I was not just trying to get him to let me stay and I needed help with it. He told me if I start making progress with myself that we can start seeing eachother again but I feel lost. My parents are so mad at me because I failed my relationship. They because very strict with me and are pushing me the exact way I told them it would not help. there is more but this is the just of what happened. I just need someone to listen and encourage me to do better.",Depression
10966,"(sorry for bad english, I am from Italy and my English is not that good... I am using google translate)For a few months I started feeling sad and suicidal, it all started on April 6th. I ran away from home because I could no longer manage a strange feeling (like stress but with anxiety and sadness) and I found it as a method of release. A volunteer friend of mine helped me, from that moment she has always helped me and she has made me feel better, simply by integrating me into the activities that are done in my association. I finally felt good, after years of being locked away at home all the while hoping that the days would end soon. The problem? I have been an asshole. I continued to feel bad instead of trying to do better by causing problems and annoying everyone. Until, on April 26, I was forbidden to volunteer (for reasons related to my age, for nothing else) he did not write to me anymore, when he looks at me he avoids me and I returned to my life before, on a fucking chair sitting all day, near a computer, looking at the time every few minutes, hoping that the time to sleep is approaching as soon as possible. The first few weeks I was VERY BAD and I could hardly get out of bed. I started therapy with a psychiatrist and I go there every Monday. I continue for weeks to feel bad and feel suicidal in a very strong way, but over time these feelings have been felt less. Now I spend the weeks doing nothing, all the time on a screen, I swear it feels like torture, time never seems to pass and sometimes it seems to go by very fast, I arrive at the weekend without even knowing what I did (memory loss) and what worst is that I no longer feel anything other than this feeling of stress. Writing this I realized I was in a really shitty situation ... the only option I really know is suicide, but I do not want to die, I wish this hell would end. The worst thing is that I do not have any friends, I stay silent for weeks except when I have to talk to my father, who never cares about me for work. I have always been hated at school, and now I have social anxiety ... for various reasons I have skipped school in the last two years, and having to go back this September makes me too anxious. I honestly think if even that goes wrong then what a shit life, I will kill myself. Sorry if I wrote things that are sometimes not connected to each other, I write this just to let off steam. just letting off stem &lt;3",Suicidal
10969,"NSFW for cursing.College student stuck at home here. Probably been depressed for a long time but it got a lot worse this year. I cannot really talk about it with anyone who is not paid though. I try to describe what it is like to my parents, but it always goes poorly, and I always end up feeling worse. I feel like they always blame me for it, saying that it happened because I am not as active as I used to be, do not eat as well as I used to, and cannot get a good sleep schedule together, and that I can cure it by fixing these and taking the antidepressant that has not worked for the past two months. I used to love working out and lifted every day, and I also used to love making healthy food too. I did not just quit because I got lazy and said fuck it one day. I got so tired that it took the amount of effort I gave maxing out my deadlift to get out of bed in the morning. They also say that I am probably sad all the time because I cannot pay attention in class, but in reality I am so tired and upset a lot of the time that I do not give a fuck about class. It just makes me upset how casually they give me the advice. As if it was super easy, but I am such a lazy and stupid piece of shit that I suddenly forgot that exercise is good for you. Even without their 'help', I have been starting to drag my ass outside for a walk as often as I can, and I have been trying like hell to get into yoga. It just does not feel the way it used to. Whenever I try and express it though, they say that me telling them how I feel and not having a solution for it, and not liking their input makes them upset. Then I just sit there feeling like a selfish piece of shit for spreading the misery instead of just keeping it inside, and thinking that this was the time that they would just listen and sympathize. that is my rant for the day. I feel trapped in my own mind",Depression
10970,"I started meds a few month ago, Wellbutrin, they worked before just fine. But my anxiety was getting to the point where it was making my so depressed. I felt hopeless, like I would live with a sore chest forever, snapping short gasping breaths. My therapist thinks it is the meds, my doc disagrees. We put me on a new anti-anxiety med, Buspirone. it is made the depression so much worse. Within a week I feel like I just want to give up and die. I am sitting in my rehearsal right now. I am a professional musician and doing really my first real, almost normal, gig since COVID started. I am with all my dear friends doing awesome music and having a blast. But I am singing and behind mask in crying. No matter where I have ever been. The lowest pit I have been in. The worst amount of circumstance this has never happen. I have never wanted to stab myself in the chest while singing. I feel like life has been way worse for me before. I have been in much more depressing and anxious circumstances. I feel like these suicidal thoughts are not real. I feel they are not authentic. Are they chemically manufactured? I should be happy. But I just want to die. I should be happy, but I just want to die",Suicidal

The vet said hes heart stopped pumping, so at least it was not painfully for him.My little boy, who barely turned 1 year old, who is been waiting for me every day when I got home from work, sleeping on my chest and rubbing his little head against my nose for hours watching tv. The one who helped me smile and laugh again, after years of being unhappy with life, was ripped away from me just like that, and honestly I can only see the way down from here..Times have been tough these past years, and you helped me find a reason to wake up every day. Even when money was tight, I would always spend my last money on food and treats for you, and the happiness of you would always do me better than a meal.He used to love to play fight with me, and even as he got bigger, he always knew how hard he could be without being too much. I have so many great memories with you my dear friend, but not nearly as many as I should have... The huge personality in you made me smile just thinking about you, and its what got me through the days the past year.. Now I am not sure how to fill the gap anymore..I have always felt so lonely, and even though you could not talk, I felt like I understood you, and your company was worth more than the company of any person..I will miss you, and I will mourn you for a long time...

I hate my life, I hate feeling so uncomfortable in my skin, I hate the fact that my parents do not love me for who I am, I hate how I know I will not be able to transition ever. I hate my family, I know that is a bad thing but they are just not my family. All of them hurt me daily, they let my brother hurt me psychically and emotionally. They tell me I am worthless, and I probably am. I have not done anything important ever, I have not helped anyone, I just exist. what is the point in continuing when no one will miss you? I am so tired, I cannot sleep, I cannot eat, I am useless, and no one understands the pain. The pain of existing every single day and having to go through it again, even though I cannot explain why ""it"" is so painful. I do not feel comfortable, and I do not feel safe. it is like having your own personal storm that no one sees, has, or notices. I have hurt more people than I have helped, and I do not see the point continuing when I can quit. All this pain can go away and all I have to do is one thing, one thing to escape. I do not see why I should not take the chance. Anyone I have tried talking too online, says to think about all the people I will hurt. Yet no one will be affected by my death, I do not have friends too hurt, and my ""family"" does not care. I could be free right now, I could escape, I could not exist, and I still do exist.

10980,"Really need help here, I have struggled with feeling this way for weeks now.For the past month or so I have had little to no motivation to do anything anymore. Even writing this post requires a tremendous amount of effort. I have plenty of things to do, but I just have no desire or motivation to do anything. Going to the gym, working out, studying, learning a new skill, cooking and eating, it all just feels boring and dull to me. Some days I will force myself to go to the gym but I end up leaving because there is no energy/motivation to get through a workout. Nothing is enjoyable, besides video games and porn, but even those two things are getting really boring and do not provide me with the same amount of satisfaction any longer.I finally figured out that a large part of this problem stems from how lonely I am. I am 35 and I live with my parents. I left my job in the military because I could not take it anymore and wanted to earn my bachelors degree. I moved back in with my parents because of the pandemic, although I will return to school in the fall. I HATE living with my father, who is even more depressed/lonely/pathetic/miserable than I am. he is an incredibly toxic person to be around, and I know once I am gone and away from him I will begin to feel better.I do not know anyone where I live. I have absolutely no friends. I looked for groups to join on [meetup.com]( but nothing really interests me. Besides, going to clubs like that just seems so strange to me. I have never had a girlfriend and never had sex. I am a good looking guy who is in great shape, but I think years of watching pornography online has really harmed/damaged my brain in some way. I have incredibly high expectations in women. I am trying to stop watching porn, but it is the only thing in my life that I enjoy and look forward to. That really hurt me to say that, but sadly it is true.The worst part about this entire situation is the amount of time I am wasting sitting here doing nothing all day. I have plenty of things I could be doing, but NOTHING interests me anymore. Everything is a chore and requires a tremendous amount of effort to do.I just want to feel productive again, but I am not sure what to do.

10983,"This may be very hard to read for some.as a kid, I was exposed to a lot of explicit material on the internet that I should not have had access to whatsoever. i was familiar with the concept of sex, but not masturbation. my pent up curiosity and sexual frustration lead me to doing some pretty awful things. i was sitting on my couch one morning feeling very horny for reasons that were completely beyond my understanding. my dog was sitting on my lap and when i adjusted myself on the couch, i felt a slight tingling sensation in the private area. initially i thought i had to pee but decided to explore it further as the feeling was completely different than what i was used to. so i kept moving and lightly rubbed up against my dog's back before i reached an unexpected orgasm. i had no words to describe it. i was never too aggressive and the dog was not harmed. i was always fully clothed and reached the orgasm fairly quickly, almost frighteningly so.this happened on and off, very rarely, for the next 2-3 years or so before i finally brought myself around to stopping for good. at the time, I simply just saw this as a convenient way to masturbate because i did not really know anything else.the last thing i wanted to do with this post was cook up any pathetic ""excuses"" that would justify these actions so if anywhere you think i did, please hold me to task in the comment section. acts like this will naturally result in some well-deserved moral condemnation, and rightfully so. i am now fully convinced that i have committed one of the most depraved acts a human being can commit, regardless of age. i was young and stupid and acted out of my own morbid curiosity and i just wanted to express the fact that i am deeply remorseful and cannot apologize enough. are these actions any bearing of who i am today? are suicidal thoughts warranted in this situation? i posted something similar a while ago on a different sub but it quickly got removed before i got many answers so i decided to give it a second chance. my hope is to merely seek closure.i am so fucking sorry I took sexual advantage of a dog in my preteen and I feel like shit about it today",Suicidal

I got into drugs after high school and overdosed on heroin like 4 or 5 times. Each time I either woke up or was saved by someone. I guess ""saved"" is not the word I would like to use because death would have been a relief, but still, there it is. I hate my life. I have a great job, a great girlfriend, great friends, and a loving family, but it does not seem to matter to me. What I want most in this world is for my life to end. Everything just seems pointless no one has ever been able to convince me otherwise.I am going to be poor forever. there is no hope of retirement or becoming independently wealthy, which I think might be the only thing I would have to look forward to.Every single day I struggle to get out of bed, pretending that I want to go to work. The fact that I have to slave away at a meaningless job in order to survive kills me inside. There does not seem to be a point to anything.In 40 or 50 years I will finally die, but why the hell should I allow myself to suffer for that long? Happiness does not seem real or even worthwhile since I am going to die anyway and everyone who cares will also die.I hate living so much. I never asked to be born yet here I am desperately trying to fake it. All I want is for this life to be over. I do not even care about heaven or hell, both of which I do not believe in. I do not care about a legacy or having kids or a family. None of it seems fair to anyone else when I would just be faking it the entire way.If I did not have a girlfriend I would be dead already. I love her so much that I cannot get myself to leave her in pain. But I want it so bad. I want to die more than anything else in this world. Idk what I am expecting to hear but I guess I just needed an outlet. I will probably try and end my life for real eventually but until then I guess I will just struggle on and pretend to be happy.Sorry for the post I guess, I know I am not asking anything or seeking out advice but I have no one I can actually talk to. I have a therapist and a psychiatrist who both do not take me seriously and think pills will help. They do not. They just make me sleep better which I guess is a relief of some sort, but nothing helps. I have tried so many different kinds of meds and professional help. Nothing fixes anything.I fantasize about the day I finally grow the balls to kill myself but I cannot separate myself from anything or anyone keeping me alive. I am just absolutely miserable.

It also did not have her face so it at least it will not ruin her life. I ended up confessing a while later out of fear, the guilt came later. Her, being the angel she was, was willing to stay and work it out, but eventually she left because she could not move on. Why did I do it? Because I got a fucking kick out of it for one moment. I was exposed to fucked up shit from a young age and had a lot of creeps who ""talked"" to me. I knew I was fucked up, but never thought it would affect my relationship with this perfect girl. I was a loner for most of high school and pretty much everyone thought I was a loser and I had a crush on this girl. I somehow got to be with her like it was a movie.

Some days I feel better knowing she has moved on and people make mistakes, but days like today, I deserve to die. I want her to put a gun to my head and shoot me because I emotionally scarred her and we loved each other so much. She trusted me. I tried doing stuff to myself, but I am too much of a coward to finish the job. Parents found out, but that died down. When we broke up, I had a tough time and everything was going wrong, but that was okay because I deserved it. I wanted to suffer, but now things have started to get better in my life and I hate it. I hate that I am alive and God is not punishing me more. I feel like I need her permission to live. I like to starve myself, dunk my head in ice water, or do something so I do not go insane. My counsellor ignored my last email after I missed her call.I do not want her to be sad because of me. She was so nice and I broke her. She said she forgave me, but I want to make it right.

11021,"Greetings everyone. I do hope you are having a good day/night. I have come here to post my final message, thank you to all who will read it and please hold on tight to your life. I have seen many things throughout my life. I lost my father and several other family members early on. My mother was beaten and spit at by my father and grandmother when she was pregnant with me. That is all I will mention here abuse wise. I grew up alone without any supporting figures. I have survived a war in my country, although it lasted only a few months, it was still not a pleasant experience. I was used by people I thought were friends and I was in three toxic relationships. I have tried ending it dozens of times but I just could not do it. Now that I finally have nothing, actually nothing, only confusion and pain, I do believe I can do it today. I used to be a happy optimistic kid and now it is a shame to see myself as corpse (mentally) I wish I made the right decisions and did not traumatise myself even further. I regret what I have done, mental instability was never an excuse to harm or plot against others, neither can it ever be an excuse to hurt animals. Please please please get therapy as soon as you feel something is wrong, I did not do that and it was the biggest mistake I can think of. Please hold on everyone and do your best to work with what life has given you. I wish for others to not end up like I did, I wish for others to be at least somewhat happy. Farewell people, I do not know any of you but the only thing I hope for is that you do not go through what I have. That your heart does not die, that your hope does not die. And I assure everyone that someone out there cares. The decision is mine, I have already been considering it for a long time. I know I could have kept going and achieved something. But with the near insane state my head is in, to keep going would only be torture. Today is the day",Suicidal
11022,"The past couple years have changed me and really put things into perspective for me (I am in the US). I have lost all motivation and reason for doing things, I am always negative and pretty much constantly worry about death. I have gotten so fucked up mentally this past year. I have become extremely depressed, I stopped working out, to do any of my hobbies is a chore for me, I hate my job and cannot find a new one or figure out what to do with my life, I am always snippy and short tempered with my family. I did not go to my sister's birthday BBQ last night because I knew I would just bring my dread, depression, and misery with me. I do not think I am suicidal but it is definitely the easier option and I have considered it alot recently. I do not see much to look forward to if the world is ending and there is political mayham in almost every country. Seriously why cannot people realize we are all in this together and billionaires and corporations can fuck off. I really related to Bo Burnham's Inside and recently cannot get ""All Eyes on Me"" out of my head. I feel like this great life I had planned from when I was young got ripped away from me. what is the point of a pointless, meaningless job, if I am not helping people or trying to save the planet? what is the point of having kids, if they will just see the end of the earth? what is the point of getting married, I will just be miserable and alone forever? I do not want to live like this, please make it stop. I just want the constant existential dread to stop",Depression
11028,So I have suffered with bi-polar most of my adult life (I am 36 now) This last year has been tough. Not just because of the pandemic but family issues as well. I have the support of my wife and luckily a really good mental health nurse. But I do not plan when I want to kill myself. Its always really impulsive. Which is quite dangerous - because I do not have any trigger signs where I am like okay I need to do something Anyway I took one this week. Zopiclone - 28 tablets 7.5mg. Wife phone the police and ambulance. Police turned up first. They were fine (I have had previous police visits and they have been utter knobs) ambulance rolls up. I am feeling pretty woozy now. So straight to hospital for me. On a drip - blood tests and stomach pumped. Nurses and Drs were actually sympathetic (I have had it again where they treat you like shit) then I had to see the mental health worker - explained to her it was impulsive I do not want another new mental health nurse. Then the next few days after have been rough as fuck. Constant sickness. Foggy head. Pins and needles all over. The sense of I cannot even kill myself. Another thing to add to the ever growing failure list. But I am still here. Writing this. So part of me is gripping on. What happens when an overdose does not work.,Depression
11030,"Background info: there is something wrong with me where when my stuff is moved around or organized differently it makes me freak out its such a horrible feeling. Idk why, it makes me have this huge rage I cannot control and flail my body around and it always makes me want to sh a ton (but I cannot bc my parents know I sh and check). My parents have organized my rooms lots of times without telling me and every time it becomes some huge fight. My room gets messy a lot because of my depression and my parents get upset about it and stuff. I am 18 and I cannot afford to move out even though my relationship with my parents would be 10x better if I could. I was on vacation for a week with a friend of mine and I was excited to get back. My moms appendix ruptured when I was gone, and every single day I would bike out far where I could get service just so I could check up on her. Before I got back I called my dad and I asked if anything was organized differently bc I really did not want that and I woukd rather know in advance. He said no. But when I got home, a bunch of my stuff have been hung up on my walls. To a normal person this probably is not a big deal but for me for some reason it makes me feel like my skin is burning and the world is ending. I cannot control it and I do not know why. One was my art project I worked on for WEEKS. So I tore it all down, and I very carefully tried to take my project down and it ripped on the side. That makes me so upset it was my favorite thing I have ever made. So I walked into my parents room and was flipped out and I was like there things on my wall when you told me you would not, and my project ripped. They got very mad and just told me to leave. The next day I went to talk about it. It was the biggest fight we have ever had. And I tried to explain my side and I apologized for getting upset, but explained I am very frustrated bc idk how to fix my project and they know this makes me upset and it has become a pattern. They yelled at me and said things like do you know how much we do for you!and I said yes and I appreciate that but I am just trying to explain this. They also brought up how one time they had to reorganize my room because I was going to the mental hospital and that they did not have a choice, I said I understand that and I am not upset about that (expect for the fact that when they cleaned it that time they threw away a letter from my best friend that I had to dig up from the trash). They go do you think we wanted to have to dig through your room looking for things you could use to cut yourself! And your room was disgusting and It was like a horders room! I was extremely depressed at the time, so yes my room was a mess but I was to depressed to care at the time its not like that anymore. Like I am sorry I am a burden to the whole family. Clearly I hate myself already. They did not have to be so mean. I do not know what is wrong with me but I wish they would have just talked about it instead of yell at me and say mean things. I am so fucking tired of living and so tired of not being able to sh. I just got in a huge fight with my parents",Depression
11032,"Two thoughts i would like to share today. How i feel and how i see myself in the future. Maybe I am being selfish coming here with ""such a small thing"" but i cannot see myself talking to anyone about this. So, i live in the contradiction of ""having a perfect life"" and finding no joy in whatsoever. I am only 21, currently in med school, i have family, a few friends, used to get laid sometimes before quarentine, have not lost anyone to covid due to our hard isolation. Yet, i still feel like nothing can make me happy. Things i used to enjoy are no longer fun, and i have no new interests at all... feels like things are not ""worthy"" (like ""oh, ofc i want to play guitar, but uh, it takes so much effort, i do not want to anymore). Nowadays i just wake up with no motivation whatsoever do the hateful remote college stuff and wait for the night, when i cannot sleep and, for no reason at all, feels so lonely, so empty, so lacking the reason to wake up tomorrow that i want to seat in the room and drink until i forget who i am and sleep. Tbh, even that is denied, cuz i have epilepsy and alchool makes me convulse. I do not want to kill myself, but i do think about, and i figured out i woudnt do it because ending it now feels like a selfish decision to my parents, my dog and probably half the world whom would envy my life. When i think of my future, on other hand, every scenario leads to this: I am coming home late night after some pacient die in my hands. Parents dead/old enough to care. All by myself getting a drink and finally getting the guts to mix my own damn medications with some other pills. A whole life seeking happiness and just failing finding one single thing that can, as spinoza would say, increase the bodys power of being I am not suicidal TODAY, but anywhere i look into my future, i see it there",Suicidal
11037,"I feel hopeless! I cannot eat, cannot sleep, cannot remember the last time i laughed! This all started once i decided to check up on my childhood friends from school. I am 24 years old and due to anxiety and depression I have had since i was eighteen led me to isolate myself everyone i knew. So fast foward to now. I went on linked and saw that my old friends are graduating with msc at the age of 24 and i started college jan 2021 but i fucked up my first semester. Ill be graduating at 27/28 with no Work experience. I feel hopeless. What makes it worse is that, is that i have zero self confidence due to my shitty childhood. My mom taught me to be afraid of everything and my dad beat the shitout of me and always told me i was dumb. But at 24 i cannot wait life to get better specially knowing how low my self-esteem. Through out my uneventful life i was always felt like i was going to grow up and have fun and exiting adulthood. But now i see that is not the case. The only thing stopping me from ending my life is, the pain it will bring my family. And also due to my religion. But incase this does not get better, what is the easiest way to commit suicide?do not have a gun. And i do not want to hang myself because, its painful, long and i would not know how to do it. I do not know any life threatening drugs and even if idid, i would not know how to get them. Throwing myself in front of a train seems to be my only option. Life passed me by",Suicidal
11042,"Me - 24M My Partner 29F I have undiagnosed anxiety - at least I think I do. Whatever it is, its taken a toll and ruined most of the romantic relationships I have been in. And its rearing its ugly head again, or I am. (I am trying not to place the blame on the anxiety, I need to own it)I have been obsessively checking my partners location using Find My - even when I know where she is (work, home, sisters, etc) It occurred to me recently, What would I do if she was not where she said she was? It always worries me when she (or my past partners) would go out for the night to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. I get this overwhelming feeling that they are going to find someone better, bring them home and be unfaithful; just the thought of it makes my stomach turn. I want to be able to tell myself that is not likely and get out of my own head but Its all I can think about. It does not help that my current partner is Bipolar 2 and has manic episodes where her sex drive is elevated - that scares me even more. What if she needs to scratch that itch and I am not around? What if she is mad at me and does it to get back at me? What if this? What if that? Its a deep rabbit hole. To pile on the crap, she works retail and I have an office job so there is several hours every night that I try to keep myself busy and not imagine her sneaking off from work to be with someone else. Speaking of work, she is fairly new at this job in a management position and they are already talking about moving her to a new store possibly out of state as the next step career wise. Now this is not for a few years but I have got obligations here that make it more challenging for me to pack up and move to a new state if that is what happens. She, she just has me and lately its felt like she would be willing to drop me like a sack of potatoes should the offer come up.Its been a recurring argument; we never have time for just us you are always on about workJust be present with me they call you in every day, even on your days off its taxing to say the least. We talked recently and it came up that our priorities are out of order Hers are: 1. Her career 2. My Career 3. Our relationship Mine are: 1. Our relationship 2. Our careers It just feels like she is not willing to compromise at all. I have asked her multiple times if she would be willing to but its always I do not know what my plan is yet I do not want her to give up her future for me but I do not want to be considered when she thinks about her future, that does not seem crazy, right? The icing on the cake is I have developed a little bit of a weed addiction. Problem is - I work for Uncle Sam. And also, I act like such a child when I am high. I try not to I try to be chill like everyone else but when I am high is the only time I feel like I can not worry about everything else.So yeah I act like a child when I am high because the rest of the time I have to hold everything together and its this sweet sweet release from that. I do not know what the point of this rant is - is it a confession, is it a rant, I just want to be heard, validated maybe. What does it look like from the outside?Ask questions for clarification if you want. I feel like my anxiety is ruining my life",Depression
11049,"Well here it goes since this is my first post here and just looking for a positive comment or maybe some advice. I will start off by saying that I am 21 and unemployed. I have a GF and we are great together. I have family that is within an hour drive. I have a decent support system in my life. But lately I have just felt bland about everything. Any hobbies I enjoyed have kind of died and I do not have much hobbies other than gaming. While I have been unemployed for the last few months I have been trying to get my head straight, I quit my E-Cigarette mid May. Used to smoke alot of weed. Now I have cut back and using that as a reward instead of a nightly ritual. Since I have been off work I have been trying to figure out what my interests are and what I could see myself doing in the future as a steady career. I will be honest... I am a lazy guy. I go for walks sometimes to get me out of the house. Listen to podcasts. Apply for jobs. Gaming seems to be the only thing that I slightly enjoy simply because all the action is happening infront of me, I am not physically moving but I am controlling what is happening in the game so that is entertaining for me. I have gotten job offers and I always find something wrong with them, whether it be the commute, the pay, or the hours (too early or too late). I just cannot seem to get any traction, any motivation. I just do not really know what to do. I look at our planet and hate it because it is dying and we HAVE to do something but big company's are not doing anything. Society is breaking down slowly but surely. I do have a doomsday mindset I will admit and I am trying to kick it, but it is hard when there is so much negativity and so little positivity in the world. Everyone just keeps saying to me ""you will be back on your feet and feeling better once you get a job"". For some reason I do not believe them. I feel like I do not fit in this world sometimes, that I am a wasted space. That I do not want to live, but I do not want to die either. I just simply exist and I am not enjoying it as much as I once did. So what is a good stepping stone to start with? A rant about myself",Depression
11050,"Hey guys - I am 32M, and have had pretty severe depression and anxiety for many years now. When I think about it, I think it all started with my mother's death when I was a child, but for many years I buried everything, I got on with life, did not complain, went to school, went to work, did ok in life. But somewhere around the age of 21 I just cracked, I started having sleep problems, I felt anxious and depressed and even had nightmares about my mother a lot and I just could not function. But instead of seeking help I tried to just march on with life, as I had done before, but this time I was not able to. Things got worse, I was isolated, did not respond to messages/calls from people I knew, became more isolated and tried to commit suicide. I wish I had known that I was genuinely depressed. As strange as it sounds I had no idea what was going on with me. Not a single person noticed in my life, they were terrible with things like mental health etc. Not an ounce of support or understanding, just a tacit understanding that I should not talk about anything like this.I spent a period of 2-3 years pretty much bed ridden, even more isolated, lonely, health failing, mind crumbling. But with therapy and medication managed to crawl out of that hole. It has been 10 years now, 10 years of struggle and I still cannot believe it has been that long. I have been destitute, alone, isolated, homeless for a period, jobless for long stretches. Basically just so unwell that I was not able to ever plan for anything, or get my life back together. I was taking it an hour or a day at a time. There were days when just brushing my teeth was an achievement. But how could I explain this to someone? I could barely look after myself.I managed to start medication and get therapy and that was a huge help, and for the past 3 years or so I have been doing ok, but there are still moments when the pain I carry from those difficult years are hard to shake off. I thought I had friends, I thought I had family, but when the time came I was truly alone. Not a single person really helped me, and that broke my heart and changed many of my relationships. I do not feel the same, even though I still see some of these individuals...Anyway, long story short, I think I am doing ok now, but at times it really gets me down when I think of all the time I have lost, I know there is nothing I can do about it, and on better days I tell myself just to carry on and it will be ok. I try not to compare myself to friends or anyone else, but at times I look around and see people I know, people who were at one stage the same as me, and they are doing great in terms of career and relationships, and I am truly happy for them, but I see myself and it really crushes me. It dawns on me how truly sick I was and how much time I have lost, and it is hard to get myself out of that hole. I feel like I still struggle a lot and it has cost me relationships/friendships and also financially/career-wise. I look healthy, I am tall, have hair, in very good shape, but I cannot seem to tell anyone, a few times I have tried but how do you open up with such heavy stuff. Family members have just dismissed me, and acquaintances sometimes cannot believe me because they say I look like I am well. But deep inside, there are days and weeks where I feel such pain that I do not know if I can carry on.I do not know why I am posting this today, I have had an ok week, but this morning I woke up and just felt terrible. I am still on medication and yesterday picked up some more from the pharmacy. The only thing is because I take generic sertraline sometimes the brands change, I do not know if my mood has anything to do with the fact that I started taking another brand of sertraline the other day...but I just feel so low right now, have not felt like this in months, I feel like killing myself, it is a horrible soul-crushing feeling and I feel like I should hang myself to just stop feeling this. It just crept up on me all of a sudden. I know this sounds a bit negative but I just needed to reach out and talk to some fellow human beings, and just be heard and listened to, I do not have anyone I can tell and I feel like I am drowning right now. I feel such profound pain it is almost making me cry, which never happens. Like my mood is just out of whack and cannot be controlled.Please, anyone, help, suggest something or just say you hear me and that I am not alone. I really need to just talk to someone, or to be heard. Having a really bad day.",Depression

11053,"Originally posted on the r/suboxone, I thought it might be more appropriate here. But peeps, kindly let me know where it should go. AnywayJust wondering if anyone is in the sameboat. My story of addiction is a short one compared to many but this post is long so Ill provide a concise TLDR at the end. My mother (who I was extremely close to and saw every single day, even when I lived by myself) died suddenly in her sleep a week after my 27th birthday. As you can imagine, the word devastated does not do it justice. I already had been battling depression since I was a little girl, never without any relief (SSRIs, NDRIs, atypical, even ketamine infusions followed by sublingual ketamine drops. The only thing I have ever tried is an MAOI). They finally put me on adderall for several years for treatment resistant depression. It got me out of bed, made it so I could hold down a job, but if I chose not to take it for a day? Id spend the day in a blacked out room, leaving the bed and seeing the light as little as possible. The adderall made me feel horrible physically, moody, reckless but I was worthless otherwise. My mom was the only one in my family who ever knew any of this and knew that I was always a much, much different kind of little girl. It was s problem her and I tried to solve together but never could. I am the youngest of three. A sister 12 years my senior and a brother 9 years my senior. They both chose to never do anything significant with their lives. My sister was always a waitress and my brother was a bartender. I was the only one who attended university and built a career (as a writer despite this poorly written post). Its actually very abnormal because my family moved here from Israel when I was still very young because of the better schools. Most Jewish families take education very seriously but my siblings always had zero confidence, ambition, or passion. And my parents were not the type to push. In hindsight, they are like my father. My father retired in his 50s and my mother supported everything and everyone. She still paid my siblings phone bills even though they were nearing 40, lent money to whoever needed it. And and I am sure the financial stress she was under contributed to her early death. When she died, the bills and debt did not stop and someone had to take over. I was the only realistic person to take over and I did. But I was overcome with such incomprehensible depression and grief, I just could not work. And I could not lose my $75k a year job when I suddenly had a family to support. My sister was unemployed at the time and stayed that way for a year and a half following my moms death despite the obvious pressure I was under. My brother had recently had a baby (a year ago) so that was his excuse but he would not have helped regardless.To get to the point, I started getting prescribed oxy 30s by a doctor who ruined my adolescence and is now no longer allowed to practice. He prescribed them to me for carpal tunnel and they numbed me and made me capable of working. I knew I was making the choice to become addicted. I knew Id have to face it eventually, and about 10 months later after losing 15 pounds (I was less than 130 to start with) and when Id gotten to the point where I was spending hundreds and hundreds of dollars on more pills, I overdosed after taking 90mg of oxy and 30mg of adderall. Well I had a seizure, I do not know if that is technically an OD. It happened in our driveway and when I came out of it, my father screamed at me for hours, saying things that Ill never fully get over. A month or so later I was prescribed buprenorphine. At first I thought I felt good because I was not going through withdrawals constantly while stressing about finding my next pill but buprenorphine totally changed my life. I felt like a normal person for the first time in my entire life. I was still more of a depressive than your average 20-something girl, still an introvert but I cleaned things, kept my space tidy and organized, I got promotions and raises at work, I had healthier interpersonal relationships, I went to the gym for nearly two hours every day for a year and a half. Two years after (almost to the day) of my momss death, I met the man I am nearly certain I will marry. He knows everything about me and has never once judged me. And for the first time, I know I can be a good partner who will not drag him down into my depression. Hes also on Prozac and is a bit of a depressive himself but it somehow makes us even closer. Hes about 10 years older than me and his wisdom about sadness and depression really help me. And we just love each other in a very pure way. It feels right. I have read everything there is to read about buprenorphine and its use in depression. It breaks my heart that more people cannot access it for this reason and that as long as I take it, I will have the label of an opioid addict, something that reminds me of the darkest period in my life. I recently tried going off and trying Wellbutrin instead. It was a horrible experience. During that 8 weeks I bought Xanax and cocaine (two things Id never had any addiction to or interest in but felt I needed them to work and sleep). My boyfriend saw the change in me and really urged me to say fuck the stigma, I am going to take whatever pill makes me the best version of myselfWhen it comes down to it there are people like me out there. Who knew from the time they were little kids that they were depressed. And they cannot find relief. At some point, although I have never personally had suicidal thoughts, I can see how people feel like giving up. Maybe this post is better for the depression thread, I am not a Reddit pro. Just sharing my experience with a medication that turned me from a train wreck who never felt sober happiness to someone on the precipice of engagement who derives pleasure from painting and reading and running these are things are never thought were possible before buprenorphine. TL;DR: Buprenorphine finally successfully relieved my treatment resistant major depression and has been a literal miracle for me personally even though it took going through hell to get here. After lifelong treatment resistant major depression, Buprenorphine changed my life.",Depression

Sometimes I drink coffee in between meals so I will not eat anything because of my ""complex"". ANYWAY, I have had some downfalls the last few months, which led to a serious stage of depression.

11059,"This will be really long, since i have not opened up to anyone and i want to say everything here, so I do not think anyone would read this. It all started last year, when me and my best friend randomly became friends with a boy from our school, after online classes started. we suddenly got close and were known as a trio and the boy started liking my best friend. he confessed to her after some days, only to get rejected by her since she already had a boyfriend. that pissed him off, and they had a fight and blocked each other everywhere. i was asked to do the same.after some months, in my mathematics class he texts me saying that he wants to be friends with me again, and i unblock him. we became quite close, and somewhere he had begun calling him my best friend. it is not like i minded it, so i went with it. he started going out with a girl during this time, whom he said that he liked a lot, but i knew that he only wanted a girl. this pissed me off a bit, but i did not say anything. we were quite good friends during this time, but the way he treated the girl annoyed me a lot. he went as far as asking another girl for n*des while he was with her, and when asked, he termed it as a joke. despite all this, I was still friends with him.The last straw of their relationship was when the boy forced himself on the girl inspite of her asking him to stop many times. that was it, i was ready to break my friendship with him. i cared about the girl, and i could not be friends with someone like him.this is where the entire problem began.i wrote him messages, saying that I wanted to end our friendship, and i think it was during this period when i started getting manipulated by him. he kept nagging me for forgiveness, and convinced me that he was the victim in that situation and that it was not intentional. i knew that this was wrong, but I think it softened my view for him, a bit. i wanted to hate him, but it was practically impossible for me to do so. so i started talking sh*t about him in group chats and calls where he was not present, so that my friends would think i hate him.somewhere during all this, he was again my self proclaimed best friend, and along the line i lost many friends too, which made him the only support i received in my life. when all my classmates talked sh*t about me, he was my support. or so i thought. i tried getting rid of him from everywhere. blocked him, ignored him, everything. but somehow he still contacts me and i have no idea how. he can go as far as calling my parents to tell them that I am ignoring them and tell them to ask me to unblock him. i hate him, very much, and I have tried countless times to push him out of my life but he keeps coming back. I even faked having a boyfriend, so that he leaves me, but he did not, and said that he would wait for me till i broke up with him. after all this, he keeps saying he loves me, did so for a long time and he is done a lot for me.along the line, i kept getting softened and manipulated by him, and mistook his obsessiveness and toxicity for love and affection towards me. I had a therapist but she kept asking me to focus on my studies and one time i tried opening up to her she shut me up saying this is all just superficial sh*t. somewhere along, i started taking anti depressants, which were of no use since they make me feel numb and devoid of feelings. I cannot talk about this with my parents either, since they love him and think that he is a really good guy. and when i try to talk to them, they ask me to take anti depressants and that they are busy for my bullsh*it.to be honest, I am a very impulsive person. I do everything out of impulse. I cut my lower back length hair short because of impulse. and then i regret everything. my last straw was a similar decision. he said he loved me one day, and with all my tangled feelings of love and hate towards him, i agreed upon dating him. a decision i deeply regret, since it was really my last straw. it was suffocating for me and i just wanted to run away from everything. but i could not break up because that would mean me losing the support of my classmates all together, since he had already manipulated all of them into thinking that he loves me a lot, they would think I am toying with my feelings. i could not do that anymore, so i broke up with him, with my best friend's support. i thought i would finally get rid of him, but he created a lot of drama saying that i toyed with his feelings and everything. and all my classmates called me all sorts of things because of that. he somehow even managed to befriend my best friend too.I am just done with all this. I have run away countless times from home, but i always end up coming back because i have nowhere to go. Recently, I overdosed on anti depressant pills, and currently I am in the hospital. I really thought I would die, but I did not. I do not know what to do, and how to get him out of my life. I am going to get into a college soon, and I just cannot focus on my academics or myself because of all this.

11063,"I hate to sound lazy but there is just so much to do...and for what? You have to study or work, have to maintain a good job or grades, have to have a sufficient social circle, a relationship, be healthy, work out, maintain hobbies..its just too much for me. I have hope for the future, I have goals but there is just so much effort to reach them. Last year I had motivation and I tried for months on end with meditation and exercise and journaling and reflection and I fell off this year because it was not working for me. It was all that effort for nothing. Whenever I work up the courage to go seek out a friend or romantic interest ( I have anxiety so its a hard thing to do and I need to psych myself up for it) it barely ever works out and once again my effort was wasted. So I am here thinking about my plans for the summer, working out, trying to meet new people and getting my license ( I failed earlier this year after months of learning *I have adhd* ) and I wonder how am I supposed to muster up that effort to even have a chance at success?Every day for me is just finding different things to keep me entertained and its not like I am content doing nothing but to get out of that and live a better life I have to put in a ton of effort that is not even sure to pay off. I am mentally exhausted. I feel like I physically do not have the capacity to fight and persevere through stress anymore. Its just too much effort.",Depression
11072,"So, let me take you back to 1989. I had made a pretty bad decision in joining the USAF, as I ended up as an SP (Security Police, pretty much a patrolman), did not realize my ADHD was still there and only controlled by a lot of caffeine, and depression had been lurking in the background. I was stationed in the UK, and was pretty much miserable. My Sergeant was a full-on asshole, as were his two subordinates. Things came to a head one night while I was guarding an ammo depot. I am sitting in the shack, trying to read through a manual to help me be a better cop (as it was), and that darkness hit me hard. As a Law Enforcement person, I was issued a service revolver. Before I realized it, I had it in my hand, and was putting the barrel in my mouth. I could not feel anything but emptiness and no reason to keep living. Cocking the hammer back, I sat there, and mentally asked for a reason - ANY reason - to not pull the trigger. At that moment, the faces of my family and friends flashed in my head. I realized that killing myself was not going to end my pain; it would create pain to those I cared about. I took the sidearm from my mouth, eased the hammer back, and just broke down crying. I told my C.O. what happened, and was taken off duty and sent for therapy. Not long after, I was discharged (Honorable) and went home. It took me 32 years to finally open up and talk about that night, because I was so bothered that I had come so close to ending my life early. Sure, life has had its up and downs, but I am glad that I chose to live. It has given me an over-developed sense of self-preservation. Yes, I am still dealing with depression and seeing a therapist. There are days when it just feels like everything is shit, but I just push through. &amp;#x200B;***\[MODS: I am hoping that this is within the rules. I just needed to get this posted to keep being able to talk about that moment. Please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit, and if there is one that would be more appropriate. Thank you.\]*** It took 32 years for me to open up about this...",Depression
11083,"Honestly it feels like I am living a hell that was created for me. My father was negligent and never bothered to spend time with me, blaming it on the fact that I looked unapproachable. To this day he still owes my mother 8k in child support. My mother was abused and so, i too was abused both physically and mentally. I remember that when i was young, i did not want to shower because i did not want to get my hair wet, her solution was to put me at risk for hypothermia by keeping in a shower with freezing water. And honestly, to this day I never got over it. I never got over the fact that she never made time for me, meaning that I had to raise myself since I was 10 years old. I never got over her tantrums. Wherever I set her off, she would threaten to knock all of my teeth out. I finally moved out after a really shitty fight that made me feel like that place was not home. The place that I am at now does not feel like home either. I have 3 roommates and the two guys that I live with are such a hassle. The first one will not pick up after their dog and there is always a mess of fur everywhere. He will not even pick up after his dog's poop from outside. The second person believes that if he does not talk about his problems, they will go away eventually. they have resorted to calling me childish and immature because I get frustrated that they cannot pick up after themselves. They do not clean, put their dishes in the dishwasher, cook, etc. Even leaving the lights on all night knowing that it will raise the electrical bill. I honestly feel like maybe I am the one that is causing the problems. I am the one that just does not understand the people around me. But I just do not feel like I can right now. My mom uses me as a punching bag because her mother is passing away, my other grandmother passed away a couple of weeks ago (whom I was much closer to), having to move out, trying to locate my first job, and having to deal with my own constant thoughts...I just cannot anymore. I am trying so hard to give myself a reason to still be here because I want to live most of all. I want to fail in love. I want to grow old. But most of all, I want to try new foods and see so many new things. If I left then I would never get to finish reading my webcomics. I would never get to listen to songs from Colliding with Mars and Unlike Pluto. I would never get to finish any of my favorite games. And I am still here because I recognize that my pain would just transfer over to my family. Just the thought of it all being over, it sounds like such a blissful idea. It makes me feel like I will finally be at peace.I would not have to cry anymore. I would not have to feel hopeless. I would not have to suffer. I finally would not feel so lonely. And I would not have to deal with the fact that I am emotionally fucked up. I wish that I knew how I can make things better. I want things to change but I do not know how or where to start. Because if I have to hold on, I know that sooner or later, I will let go. And when I do, there is no turning back. Every day feels like a burden",Suicidal

11093,"Sometimes I think it would be better if I did not exist. All traces of my existence erased, nobody would suffer or remember me. That would be perfect, bc I do not want to die (or live either) or feel pain but I want to take the weight of living off my back peacefully. Life is not worth all the sadness I feel when I start thinking about how I am miserable. There are times where I am feeling good and think ""Life is good, after all. I want to live like this a little longer, I want to live"", but this happiness does not last forever and I start overthinking againI also feel guilty for not wanting to live bc my family is wonderful and I have everything I want. I do not think I have the right to be sad about my life bc I definitively could be worse. I live normally, I am not really sad or gloomy most of my days, it is just that I am tired and empty. I go to a good school, but now I hate studying, I do not want to study more in college and I do not want to work after that, but I will do it because I have to. If I am going to be forced by life to choose what to do for the rest of it, then so be it. I do not have a career I would like to follow, so I will just pick the one I hate least. Whatever, I am just a lazy mf that does not want to deal with hardshipsI'm young so maybe I will feel better someday.

Am 32 and if I have got another 40 years of this shit to put up with I do not want it. I was also just hanging on from having a mental breakdown so I went and done a long distance walk. I came back and slowly started to become depressed again. I met a woman and even tho I only seen her for 4 weeks I loved her from the moment I saw her dove right in feet first. Total fool that I Am. we had the smallest of fallouts and I have been given a two week break to better myself. But all its done is bring everything I previously thought about myself to the surface again. So the doctor prescribed me Prozac. I really thought it would stop me crying and feeling sorry for myself. But I have reached a point today I have started looking for the best way to end it. How the hell I still feel anything after starting these tablets is beyond me I literally cannot stop crying and am on Prozac I thought this would have numbed my feelings but I have cried since Sunday last week.,Suicidal
11100,"Hello everyone! I just want to put a disclaimer that I am poor right now and I cannot afford therapy or even just the medicine alone.I grew out of wedlock and after a year of marriage, they had annulled their marriage because divorce is impossible here. I am barely hanging on a thread right now despite being currently semi-stable. So, I grew up to be extremely neglected by my parents, having no emotional support and it was really tough because I could not cry in front of my mom as it was considered weak. I would like to say that we are decently close because I came out as gay to her and my family included, but she is not really the type to give any emotional affection especially now that I am older. I have not heard any *I love you*s from both of my parents and they cannot tell me directly how they are feeling and that I have the same situation. We do not communicate at all and I am already 18 so I do not absolutely know what it is like to be loved through affirmations and physical affection. Currently, both of them have their own separate families and I am staying with my mom, but of course, I am living near poverty. It sucks because I have not really felt what family is nor do I feel belonged because most of the time it is forced interactions. My father messaged me that he was sorry, but he is not really because he just happened to know what was happening to me. If he was sorry, then he would have been at the start. there is too many information I could say, but know that I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents because they were too busy, too selfish, and too complacent.Anyway, I just wanted to know if it is normal to feel and say to myself these words while growing up: **I want to die**? It probably started on elementary when I was constantly bullied both physically and emotionally by my classmates and I remember trying to open up to my mother. I downplayed every problem I faced to my mom because she would often say how she is filled with problems, so naturally I had to talk to her in a non-worrying and non-stressful manner. She said to just be strong and fight back, and I did. For many years, I pointed a knife on my chest and wanted to stab myself with it many times at that age. But, I eventually moved on from that because I stood up for myself. It did lessen, but to my female classmate, it got worse.Moving on to 7th grade, I transferred and of course I was again on the center of ridicule with somehow showcasing slightly feminine behaviors. It was stupid, but I was made fun of, though I ignored it because I was better than them. I was intelligent; I was better than most of the kids at my age, however, I knew that I was going to be ridiculed always and such thoughts came back.Moving on to 8th grade where I transferred again because we moved places again, I was in a new environment. A more competitive environment whose friend groups and cliques have already formed and stabilized. I was basically an outcast in a block section of 40 students. I was terrified of crowds, I would often get nervous when conversing to other people, but that was fixed by myself when I joined ROTC for high school. Anyway, with me being an outcast and people avoiding me because they already have their own friends and also me having a quirky personality, I often spent my time alone or trying my best to sit with others. Since, I felt so deprived of friendship and bonds, I subconsciously wrote ""I want to die"" again in a piece of paper because that is what I felt and I never talked about it to my mother, even up until now.9th grade came and I was raped by my uncle. I was scared and scarred, mainly because I thought I was going to contract any virus. I attempted to ask help from my mom, but I downplayed it again to just a dream and mentioned it was vague. I was afraid of putting someone in jail, afraid of what others will think of me, and afraid of what will happen in the future. Up to this day, I am still frightened by the thought and image of him, but I already have moved on from the nightmare. I cried many nights because I still did not have any close friends and I was always called weird. 10th grade was a bit better and more tolerable and I ranked 2nd on the whole batch. This was the time, before I transferred again to 11th grade, I hooked up with someone from Grindr. It was mainly a one-time thing, but then when I reached 11th grade and moved to a more-populated area, I found myself using that app many times to seek comfort, connections, and distractions to my problems. This was the time I recognized my mental health was worsening even more. I attempted to jump off a building twice, but failed. First was I talked myself out of it and the second was I slipped backwards and broke down. Or so I like to tell myself. I made those two scenarios up because that would at least have a more viable scenario for my situation. Truth is, I am scared of pain and being shouted to at. I fear being left out when people come in my life. It is what it is, but I am damaged. I mentioned to my mom I was suicidal, but she also said that she is suicidal and I should deal with my thing.12th grade and graduation came and until now, I realized a lot of things. I know who to blame for damaging and scarring me and I have been trying my best to cope. Again, there were so many scares that I dealt with HIV-scare (I am negative), but when you gain enlightenment, it is just dragging you even more down to the abyss. All the nights I cried and had panic attacks, all the unnecessary self-hate by hooking up and trying to OD myself, and all the negative suicidal thoughts in my head right now are all present in my head clashing.Right now, death is the closest comfort I have because I cannot handle these emotions and thoughts anymore. I feel suffocated, trapped in my own hell. I do not want to be abandoned; I want to be loved and to be hugged, and be said that I matter to the people I care and think about. I think I might just take my life sooner or later. I made a promise to myself to kill myself in two years if I do not find a constant source of happiness and I feel as if things are being faster and now I just want to remove the mountain on my back and finally feel peace through death. I just want to be loved, but it seems comfort and eternal peace is my only option right now. I do not want to be invalidated that those are not my options because (1) I am poor, (2) my parents and I do not communicate about our feelings and experiences, and (3) death is a permanent solution to my permanent problems. I have been suicidal since I was really young",Suicidal
11111,"A few years ago I have been diagnosed with Autism. I have difficulties adapting to my environment. Since the Corona happening I have been forced to adapt to the way things are (remote school, not being able to do the things that made me happy). I have not had an easy time. The fact that the things that kept me busy were not possible anymore gave me time to think. I realised I would never really matter in this world. I would just sit behind my piano for hours and hours straight. My thoughts overwhelmed me, I would just let them come, and let them go. I think the whole world is going through the same. I have a hard time accepting that it may be harder for me because adapting just takes a lot of energy.I have played with the idea of killing myself. Whenever I have these thoughts I would listen to beatles and that made me feel a little bit better.I did not really reach out to my parents or psychiatrist. I think I was afraid of bothering others.

11140,"tw: suicidal thoughts and drug usea couple nights ago, i was on lsd just to have a bit of an exploration and have some fun. my trip was fine for the most part but towards the end of the night, I was just lying in bed, face down into my pillow, and my mind made me feel as if I was dying. it was as if i was given a choice to just pass away and in the (seemingly) final moments, i thought about loved ones and people who loved me and all the happy and good things i had going in life. despite the fact that i knew i had so much to live for, i chose to let go. i think i just went to sleep so i woke up a couple minutes after. instead of feeling relieved that i did not die, i was extremely overwhelmed by the fact that i had chosen to willingly let go, and also by the fact that i did not actually pass away. i just cried for awhile, for multiple reasons. i feel guilty for what happened but i also feel a range of other emotions. i know what i need to do (seek help again) and i wanted to tell my bf and close friends about this but i just could not bear the thought of worrying them about what happened so i came here to vent a bit. tldr; used lsd and confronted the severity of the suicidal thoughts periodically come and go need to vent a bit/hear some thoughts",Depression
11145,"I feel like I have lost my humanity. I feel like an empty she will drifting through space and time, nothing more and nothing less. There is no soul, there is no me...what am I? Am I an amalgamation of chemical components working in unison to produce this thing we call consciousness, or am I something more? The more I live and the more I think, the more I know the former is true. We are chemical systems with an imperative to continue existing forever, every choice, every thought, every reaction was preprogrammed, free will does not exist.Every problem my thinking solves just causes further dilemma. Each dilemma deepens the existential dread. I yearn for love, but love does not exist. Love was a lie, love was a fairytale and a marketing scheme used to exploit the people. Love is a chemical reaction, another preprogrammed reaction that drives us to reproduce, to continue existing forever. No two people love each other forever, the feelings fade and time drives them apart. I have seen it countless times, so why do I expect any different? Why do I still dream? Why do I cling to a lie so urgently? Does this mean there is something more? I wonder, and then I realize there is not. I realize its the same reason I crave intimacy and connection, why we despise being alone, its more biological imperatives instilled within us to increase our chances of survival. We are social creatures, we evolved this way because it was the most effective strategy. I crave for that which I have never had, only because I was wired to crave it in the first place.I think about my estranged relationship with family, I think about how my father will soon die and all we will leave between us is painful memories and regret. I feel a slight sinking inside of me, just for a moment those old emotions rise within me, but just as quickly as they come, they go and again I am left with emptiness. I quickly remember that none of it matters, when he is gone it will be like I never existed in his perspective, for his perspective will seize to exist. The same will soon happen to me. The feelings fade because I remember they do not exist. I remember that they too are just chemical reactions firing off inside my brain. They mean nothing, the emotion is not real. It existed because it was imperative to my survival that I feel love for my parent, just as with every human life. Its funny how I wish I could go back to when I felt human, to when I felt alive. I miss feeling, I miss when life was still a mystery, to those days where I was not a jaded husk. I stared into the abyss and saw only blackness. Those painful days where you wish the pain would leave forever, you soon realize those days were still better than the days you thought you wanted. Careful what you wish for.I wonder, why does life want to live? Why does life fight so hard in a universe where all the odds are stacked against it, where the very intrinsic functions act to destroy it? why does it adapt and arrange itself in way to keep going? Well, maybe its because it does not know any better. Nothing matters, nothing is real",Suicidal
11152,"These past few years have been aggravating, and now I am just logged off of my social media, pretty much where anyone in real life, knows me in some way. ( No ones about my reddit account).I hate social media. All I see are a bunch of stupid posts. Post that think are funny to those people but they are obviously not to me. I get annoyed at everything. I hate small talk, so when someone, whether it is a random person or someone I know, say some stupid shit like ""hey"" or ""how are you"" I just want to throw my fucking phone out the window. I hate it. I hate talking to people. I was not always like this. I never really had friends (a bff, reliable, etc) in my life so I would be kind of open to try and make new friends, but everytime, something about it just makes not want to hang out with them or talk to, and it is not the introverted side talking, it is the annoyance of that person. Just when you think someone is okay, first impression, over a short period of time, I realize that these people are just not my type to talk to, hang out with, etc. I ghost them because I do not want to talk to, what I think are ""pathetic"" people. I have never told anyone about this kind of hatred except for here, so in their perspective, I am a ""chill"" person. I keep everything bottled up. EVERYTHING including grudges that I could remember since the day I learned to walk. No ones cares about me, no one pays attention to me. So out of the blue and without any thought, I am just logging out of my social media, hiding and deleting content. I hate looking and my class graduates having the time of their life. I hate how when I try to explain something to them, they do not get it or get the actual point of it.All I see is a bunch of stupid people. I know if these see what I typed here, they would think less of me. They already think I am a nobody. I was a nobody in high and I am a nobody now. I hate when people say ""If you need someone to talk to I am right here"" because that is what EVERYONE says. When i do manage to talk to someone, it is just stupid advise, stupid talk, surely they do not understand how I am feeling and what I am going through because they say some shit that does not even relate to it. there is not even a point in get some kind of ""therapy"" talking to someone because I think I am too stubborn to listen to so-called ""advice.""I have always been the quiet person, in school, at home, everywhere. So this post just seems more like a rant than a cry for help. It might be just the symptoms from the withdrawals I had from my antidepressants. I take 75mg of venlafaxine, and my pharmacy fucked up my prescription order so I have been off of them for a good few weeks. I finally got back on them about yesterday. it will take some time for me to calm down now, but when I am on this current medication, I still feel aggravated.My first meds were 10mg of Lexapro, then 20mg lex., then 10mg of Prozac, 37.5mg Effexor XR, now 75mg of Effexor.I am for this post. I am sorry for this stupid rant. Surely I am going to regret this later and feel embarrassed, but I just do not let anything out. I bottle up too much shit. it is hard to talk about stupid feelings and such. Ghosting my social media seems like a great start for me, I have hated it for many reasons.Sorry again. I am 21F. I hate just about everything. I am ghosting social media where people know me.",Depression

11156,"I do not know where to start this story but I recently turned 18 and I have spent the past two years mostly unhappy and anxious, I hated who I am and where I came from. As my dad died when I was nine years old, I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building, at-least that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasons.I held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope. Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died. Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it. I am still not sure if that is the truth, but sense then I have never entered my balcony. These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with. This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors. I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay (I am bisexual) and awkward. I always went home in a bad mood because of this. Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates. I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed. I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners, because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues. When COVID-19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense. All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did, and I almost succeeded. As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity, that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am. All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently, I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future. Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous. I began hating myself for being jealous and I am spiraling back down to where I was, in the past few weeks I have already missed a few college assignments, I need help to cope with these emotions, I do not know what to do anymore.

11157,"I have wrestled with being suicidal for a long time now. My life is in shambles and I am disabled physically and with mental health issues to such an extent that I am a burden on several people. I thought therapy would help, and it has...but when I explained my suicide plan for if I should ever decide its time to die to my therapist and he said that he would stick with me and ""be supportive"" regardless of what path I choose and complimented me on having a very responsible and well thought out plan.Now I feel like I have no good reason to exist and that I must be really fucked up if a medical professional, who is supposed to stop people from killing themselves, would ""be supportive"". What does that even mean? Am I misunderstanding what someone could mean by saying they would be supportive of suicide? This is not some super green shrink either. He has over 40 years experience, is considered the best care available locally, and specializes in working with people who have severe mental health issues and physical limitations. He even said that if I was able to go th route of physician assisted suicide he would even come be with me for my final farewell if I wanted him to. Is there a point where you cross a line and suicide becomes understandable or even expected? I feel like I have worn out life's welcome. I fight so hard to hang on and many days just not killing myself is an accomplishment. This feels like a blow, it has leveled me. I am in therapy to try and find reasons and ways to hang on and this just feels like permission and encouragement to let go. Like it is not OK for healthy people to be suicidal but if a disabled person is everyone is all in? My family thinks I should wait till my mom dies (as to not put her through it), find a home for my daughter, and then throw a big farewell party and die before my kid is old enough to remember me. I only have my mom and one friend who are not super supportive of me dieing. One of my aunts even offered to send me on a vacation if I wanted to go somewhere special to do it. it is hard to feel like there is hope or help out there when I express struggling with being suicidal and instead of offering support and assistance to keep living people have opinions and support about the logistics of how, when, and where I should die. Even my therapist says he will be supportive if I choose to kill myself.",Suicidal
11158,"I am a female 18 and I am in depression for almost 4 years. I feel extremely uncomfortable with my parents. they are everything I could ever wish for, but still i feel very unhappy when I am with them. Does anyone feel like this too?I think to myself that I am happy but I somehow feel insignificant to my family and the world. I cannot sleep at night properly and not be happy about anything. I was once admitted in the hospital because of panic and anxiety attack. Also had extreme stress. My parents then told me to stop studying a lot. I always feel like they make a better family without me.My feelings and their rude words that comes out of their mouth unintentionally makes me even more sadder. My head pains too much and I cannot stop crying. I am worth but not to the extent of others in this world.My family is very sweet and happy. My mother is a temperamental person and is always angry. She blames me for not doing anything as she is scared of my elder sister and blaming her and shouting at her will lead to her reciprocating the same. My sister is adamant and very much like - I am what I am I do what I want to...kind of person. She sleeps all day and night and watches movies on her computer lying on the bed. While I study all day to improve my grades. Studying has become a escape route for me. I also started watching other entertainment like k and bl series as I have never been into movies. My whole family just sits and watches movies as everyone in my house are just attached to the tv. My mother still shouts at me for not doing dishes, improper working or just simply for random stuff. She also came to know I watch kpop (does not know I watch bl lol) and started to nag at me. My father is quiet and just asks me to do tasks.. Repeatedly again and again that I get so bored of it and just leave my work to do it. My mother would still shout at me for doing the task. If I mention it was dad who asked me to do so, she would just scold me anyway. My sister will dump all her chores to me too. My mother is very unfair between us too and my sister.Sometimes they would all be in the same room teasing and shaming me while I just fake laugh everything.This is not everything. The thing that pains the most is when they act like nothing happened when others visit our house or something like that. They say I am the best and my sis is equally great and that we study and live great and just like life is perfect is every sense! My sister also likes to cajole and kiss me like a child though I mentioned countless of times that I hate it. She says I am the beautiful person she has ever seen. My mother also agrees to it as she just listens to everything my sis says.The fake mask I wear in front of everyone is starting to pain. I smile at everyone and make everyone laugh till they cry while I am always crying deep inside my heart.I hate that in a place like home, I cannot be myself. I am yet to call it a home, it is always just a house to me. I just want someone to understand and be with me Ps.

Tonight before I go to bed I am going to give myself the remaining vials of my short-acting stuff all in one sitting putting me into a diabetic coma and killing myself. I have just a little over 500U of humalog to use. There is absolutely no way I am going to survive this. I live alone and no one is expecting to come over and find me. I have a will in place with my family that was done way prior to this, so at least the money I am worth will be going to them. I have no one to depend on me - no children or partners or pets. Just my miserable, pathetic self. I give it about a week or two before people probably notice I am gone. In regards to work, I work as a nurse and I took some PTO prior to this so I have 10 days before I am expected to come back. No one will be the wiser. they will just think I skipped work until the news finally sets in. Honestly, what might be the reason people discover me is the smell. Maybe I should go outside? Idk. Everything is planned out regardless. I can finally be at peace with myself. Goodbye everyone. Fuck everything. I cannot wait to end my miserable existence. If there is a Hell, I hope I burn for all eternity. I deserve it. But it does not really fucking matter does it because I am in hell each and everyday. There is no way anyone can convince me to change my mind. I am only posting this because I want this to be kind of a send off of sorts. I have seen similar people write these and they are almost like online suicide notes (speaking of which, I should probably draft one). I do not know if that is too messed up or not.

Ill probably read some of what you guys say when I wake up, but please do not try and convince me not to do this. My mind is already made up.

11166,"I know I should not care what others think but part of me worries about others using this post against me sometime. I still need to post it though. So wednesday was the anniversary of when my brother died. For some details I guess check out my post on r/PTSD. I am autistic and really struggle to do a lot of things I want to do when they involve just myself. Its a LOT easier when others are involved. I finally was cleaning my room today, FINALLY, and then I found a spider. I had to take work off yesterday and did get some stuff done and then today but now I am hiding on the couch. I tried asking for help but that did not do anything except show me I should be trying to figure it out myself instead of asking. My dad died last month and I am just so tired of going on by myself. I hope a dog is worth fighting for but there is a lot I need to figure out first and I do not know if its going to happen. Not sure what will happen if I have to wait even longer for that. I also have mild versions of many other disabilities and it does not feel like life should be this hard because of that. I am trying to reach out for help but its not enough currently and takes time to get. Plus others have lives that do not involve me and I hate interrupting that so much. But I cannot do it myself either. I would honestly rather not do it than ask for help if possible but that cannot happen for everything so I am stuck being a burden. I am a major fawner, meaning I try to please when possible and make life easier for others. I prefer others offering than me asking and I keep getting frustrated by minor things, especially when something does not go how I want it to. My laptop decided to stop turning on last month as well and I should just get a new battery but its not that easy. My therapist gave me a different one but it is not a gaming laptop and needed to update when I turned it on. TLDR: I am trying, I really am, but its not enough and I really do not want to bother anyone else. I was FINALLY doing better and then a spider ruined it and now I just want to give up. I have already tried asking for help and I am just a bother and need to figure it out for myself. I might ask for help one more time but now there is a chance of other spiders in my room because I have not been able to keep it clean no matter how much I try.

11167,I have (F16) questioning this for awhile after my most recent productive period. i realized that maybe around a month ago i felt that i genuinely and i mean it nearly cured my social anxiety and was on the brink of recovering from my depression. this period of happiness lasted like at least a week for sure and more. i was soo productive i ran everyday in which i never do and i was even artistic and made a full drawing that i framed later. i felt so good and like i was not going to feel the loneliness of depression but this time sadly ended. i do not know why and i realized that I have felt this way before. prior i had another time period where i was super creative and decorative i decorated a full wall on my room and took time to make this spirited away painting. i was just so artistic but for some reason after i fell into this hole of anger and slept so much and rarely got out of bed. i even ended up destroying and cutting that painting i spent hours on and i broke things in my room.i do not know why i got like that but that sense of irritation/irritability followed me after my most recent high of my depression.i do not know if i should bring this up to my pediatrician or not. i also currently take wellbutrin XL 300mg which worked at first but I have been on it for so long its hard to distinguish if it works well still. questioning if my MDD is actually bipolar disorder,Depression
11170,"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there.

I am 411 and weigh 40kg, so that was WAY more than i could handle. and on december 30th, 2020, i drank an entire wine bottle, 8.5 drinks, in an hour. again, that was too much for me, and my mum realised i was drunk and came to my room. she told me she was going to call the ambulance on me again, and i told her not to (the last time i went in august was incredibly traumatic, and i cannot hear a siren even now without reliving it). she kept threatening to, so in my state, i jumped down, pushed her onto my bed and choked her. i fucking choked her. not to kill, just to scare her from calling anyone.

I keep trying to open these doors with different keys in different ways, but its exhausting. Yet, there is one door that only needs to be opened once, and it does not seem to be that heavy. I keep feeling it pull at me when ever I get in a bad mood. A door whose key has always been with me and everyone owns. Most people want to push this key away, pretend its not an option. But its always there, waiting for the day to fulfill its purpose. Because everyone will go through that door one day, whether they are prepared on not.

I have had two major depressive periods in the past and neither time was I at this level of neglect. I wish I would have just signed up for the later date, but that is not what you are suppose to do. You are supposed to graduate and immediately study full-time for 8 weeks. I even started early technically, but I put in one full days worth of work and just...stopped. I said oh after graduation when its official to start is when Ill pick it back up...but I did not. And very early on I already felt like I was so behind. I had people asking me what my progress percentage of my bar prep course was at during graduation (we did not even need to technically start yet!!) and it freaked me out. I basically decided at the beginning of July that I was too behind with only 4 weeks left, so it was not possible and I was going to fail. And I gave up even pretending to schedule studying.Part of the issue is/was covid. I felt like a real law student with real obligations, benefits, and consequences before this. Then we went online for the remainder of my degree program. I instantly lost focus and drive. None of it felt real or worthwhile anymore. I could now BS my way through my classes (school had relaxed grading policies) and when it came time to actually learn for the bar, I was incredibly overwhelmed.And hell even if I studied studied, there was never a guarantee that I would pass, but there is absolutely no chance for me to pass now. I do not care what any of my peers have to say about me not passing because well, I did not actually study, and regardless of that, peer pressure just has not ever been a motivator for me. I wish I did care what they thought in actuality because I am completely lacking motivation. My family is truly supportive and I know already they will not think badly of me. But they have checked in practically everyday. And I lie and say I studied when I did not. I cannot tell my friends because I know they all are studying by the stuff they send me. All this to say, I feel very alone at this time in my life.I cannot back out of the exam now so I am treating it like a practice test as I have heard others suggest. I can and will retake it next year. I already know that I am changing my environment so I will not be so isolated, which will help. I know in the end everything will probably be okay. I think it speaks loads that even as I am writing this with the test days away, I do not have that much anxiety. This entire time I have been numb. I am sure I will probably freak out during the test. I hope that this experience will actually motivate me in the end. If you read all this, thanks for listening. I am going to fail the bar exam",Depression

11200,"[Trigger warning] This is mostly based on the fact that my mom always wanted me and my siblings to go to the curch but I was the most sensitive one.I do not have any friends so I did not talk about it with anybody but my mom but I cannot do that anymore.Three years ago I confessed for the first time that I tought God was evil and they told me to pray for things to change.Three years later I have always been praying with the same feelings and now I cannot even think about God without feeling hatred and despair.When I was a kid my mom always tried to get me to go to the Orthodox curch and fast. Three years ago I was having problems sleeping due to my growth and my mom told me it was because I did not come to the curch with her.I got really scared.Basically being scared was the only reason I believe in God and why I am doing so badly.Now I was scared of more than not sleeping ,I was scared I will go to hell and that God will punish me for the tiniest bad tought.I even got a tic in my mind I say ""forgive me God"",I was not alowed to sleep more than 6 h ,to eat fully or without praying and I prayed more than 1 h and did 50/100 prostrations and reading everyday ,fasted for half a year every year, I slimmed up 20 kilograms and got sick, and after a long period I have had an operation to remove my colecist.I was extremely stressed out everyday, not to make a single sin and do everything right.Now cannot go to curch anymore and I want God to dessapear and to live a paceful life but I fear I cannot.I want this to end, be it depression or anything else.I am hurting myself and cry every single day for the same reason for a year and my mom does not really want me going to a therapist nor to get medicine.Sometimes my family makes fun of me and over all does not care.I do not have any friends and I do not know what I will do with my life.My mom now blames me saying that I was a fool back then but I was just a child and she were so prowd of me back then. She was saying that God had blessed her. I have never seen my mom so happy and proud and now that I am not trying to do everything right she started to scolds me again and I felt so bad.Recently she admited she had mistaken but she still makes so many of those twisted assumptions about me and thinks suffering it is my fault for having a bad temper.All these Years I have been doing whatever her and my father told me (my father was knoun for baing the weirdest and most insufferable one; when I was arownd 13 he told me I may become a slut because I was having impure toughts and that gave me so much suffering for all these years,now he died and my mom still thinks he was a saint but thinking about him is like thinking about hell)All these years I prayed that I will love God and I ended up hating God.I do not really want to make up with God.I tried but things only got worse every timeI cannot help but blame my mom because I always believed in her worlds weather I wanted or not.Even now it is the same.She is very confident and her belief is everything there is for her.She told me everything there is wrong about humans and life and it gave me depression because everything was bad and everyone was wrong. She also believes stuff that hurts me like ""it is the fault of the damn feminists that womans suffer these days working and the families have been destroyed"" and tells me there is no hapiness on earth nor something worthy of your time other than going to heaven.I do not want to go to heaven ,I just want a paceful life.But what can I do and where can I go to escape God?Everything normal people do is a bigger or smaller sin and I cannot stop thinking about all my mom had told me and I believed.Everything comes into my head :how if you are making a mistake God will give you punishments for you to wake up and come to the right path.And if you do not then that is your fault for going to hell where there will be fire 10000 hotter and if you are debauched bugs will eat you alive forever and there is guilt fear and dispair, and crows eating the belly and chest of women whom aborted children forever and ever.What can a therapist do about that though?I do not know if my family is bad, my dad is disinterested but my mom never let me believe that God can be interpreted in any other way,and I am scared to do it.She also thinks that God is all loving but the fear of God is the first love.she will make fun of other people who do not have the same beliefs as her and I hate that.She also thinks that I am genuinely a bad person and that I have to change.I do not think she is ok with me not being perfect, she tells me ""if you behave like that you will end up in a hell hole in life, nobody is going to be good with you"".She wants me to always forgive ,she always tells me a story with a woman who confessed she was getting bitten by her husband and the father told her to keep water in her mouth all day(so she would shut up).She wants me to accept life is trash and be humble and kind no mather what, sometimes she just tells me I do not understand and that is why I feel like this is bad...

11201,"I have severely autistic children. I should not have had kids. It was selfish. Completely. And now, their long term future is going to be awful. Every day is noise. there is no break from the constant hum and screeching. I have gained a massive amount of weight since I had kids. If they are awake I cannot sit down for even a minute. cannot watch a show. Can barely have a conversation. Trying to work with them and teach them anything is a fucking nightmare..I have been homeschooling because of the pandemic and it is pulling teeth. My niece and nephew are a year older than my oldest and watching everything they can do.... The freedom their parents have... The way they can just be part of society has sucked my soul out.Every program for ""autistic"" people is actually for Level 1/Asperger's. We were basically shunned out of a karate place and a haircutting place that said they worked with ""people on the spectrum."" Went to a birthday party one time and the stares and whispers were so much we just left. I would kill myself if not for the kids. But I could not do that to them. So, I guess I just keep... Muddling through whatever this is. Life?We have 0 support now that they are not in school. At this point I do not know when they will return. I want to keep them out until there are vaccines but I feel like I am losing my mind. I have seen how things are going to be when my oldest ages out of school. Supports are so awful. I will have to quit any job I have at the time and be a full time caregiver. And keep doing it until I am basically dead and the state can finally help with a care worker. Then I just hope they do not get abused. I feel like I am on the verge of a nervous breakdown. But I cannot stop because I am the one who takes care of them. I guess I go until I breakdown and hope for the best... Lol The kids stop me.",Suicidal
11202,"Sorry about the title, just wanted to grab attention I am slowly recovering from depression after so many years of suffering from it. I was in such a dark phase and since I was able to come out of it, I just want to say this to you all (to whoever suffering from a lot of things in life) : I may not understand what you are going through but there is definitely light in the end of the tunnel, provided you are willing to reach there by putting efforts. I believe we all need the push we require to excel what we are capable of in life. there is definitely hope, no matter what situation you are trapped in. I know when you are depressed, you tend to be way too hard on yourself. I have felt hopelessness for the longest time in life and eventually I got way too comfortable in feeling that way and failed to get out of the hell, which indeed ruined my life further. So, please start reflecting on yourself from a different perspective and you will definitely find a way to deal with any situation by nurturing yourself. Talk to someone who would help you get out of whatever situation. Yes, we all need validation and we seek to find people who would say comforting words and it is necessary but not every single time. Sometimes, you need people who would push you to do your best by being honest with you. Never start to pity yourself then you will eventually get too comfortable being that way and it will be very hard to get out of it. Be compassionate with yourself by knowing how you could improve certian attributes to enhance your performance in life and start taking small steps. Remember, to take only small steps in the beginning because since we are depressed, we may easily find the job overwhelming if we set difficult short term goals. Trust me on this because I have been there and have ruined my life enough. there is ALWAYS HOPE!!! START TAKING CARE OF YOURSELF!! Exercising helps a lott!!!!!! I just want to she would some positivity on whoever reading this. Sorry, if I came across as condescending anywhere across the paragraph. LISTEN EVERYBODY!!",Depression
11203,"did not know a better way of phrasing it as a title. I want to pre-face not exactly and suicidal state right now I have overwhelming wait for depression but the urge to go ahead and actually take my life has since passed, after i had overcame and pulled out of my attempt last min. so am not in immediate danger but i feel like this is the only semi private place i can ask for help since non of my friends and family know my reddit account.I, F22,Have always been depressed and being in a on/off suicidal state ever since I was 12 years old and got sexually assaulted by a family member. In the most recent year i found my self back in that scary place and bc of that i thought if i burned a bridge if would not hurt as bad of them when i was gone. When i was planning my attempt I noted that i should break up with my then Boyfriend. I was madly in love with him but i had this since of guilt that it would be selfish if i took my life while we were still together bc i was too embarrassed to tell him that i had been feeling like that and i avoided telling him about my depression out entire friendship and relationship. So when we broke up I created a bullshit reason just for the situation to be over and we have not really spoken since the break up happened in february. oh now I feel like if I myself in a better place soon I have been getting therapy I cannot help but feel so guilty I am feeling like I need to apologize because i miss him, not even really as a romantic partner but genuinely as a friend.I just cannot help but feel so selfish because I purposely burn a bridge with someone i loved so much bc i so scared of causing pain by proxy. i want to apologize and tell him the truth but I am scared ill come across as emotionally manipulative.

11207,"I was fully committed to my plan that was going to happen this weekend. First, I was going to say goodbye to my unsuspecting family and go for a walk into the woods, where I was going to gather approximately 20 leaves of *Conium Maculatum* (Poison Hemlock), eat them with a few shots of smuggled vodka or something to that effect, and die within a few hours of respiratory collapse. But now, obviously, I am having second thoughts. I knew that eating hemlock would not be fun and peaceful (but at least its not water hemlock, which kills you way worse), and I even thought that I deserved the pain that it would bring, but now I am scared. Dying from respiratory failure sounds awful. Imagine someone sealing your mouth shut, and then plugging your nostrils. I wanted a way to knock myself out very quickly after eating the leaves so I would not feel anything. Chloroform? Steal horse tranquillisers from the farm on the way to the woods? Seemed too unachievable. And I also had second thoughts because my brain was flooded with things to live for (despite them all being highly romanticised, when in reality I know that my life is shit). And now the stress, shame, anger and everything else that accompanies continuing to live is upon me. I have put off all my work because I thought Id be deadwell now what? I do not exactly have the motivation to catch up with anything, and my family have planned a bunch of outings that I am way too depressed to go on, but I do not want them to know that. Honestly being dead is practical if nothing else. Can we talk about how stressful it is to plan it and not go through with it?",Suicidal
11208,"A few months ago I was drinking almost every day and finished about a bottle of whiskey a month on top of other alcoholic drinks. I was planning on downing sleeping pills and drinking a bottle of whiskey, but when I took a shot and was ready to take the pills the shot made me throw up. I have never puked like that so I took it as that I need to stop before this becomes a habbit. I was definitely working twords it and I do still have a few bottles of whiskey but I ahwvnt touched them since. I am way too young to ruin my body hell I am only 18 but the cravings to drink lately have been strong and I almost made a drink last night but did not. it is what I am only really thinking about right now and I probably should sleep but idk I just want a swig or that warm feeling of being buzzed. its always in the back of my mind that I know I have access to that feeling but I cannot do that again because I know I will be drunk almost every night again. I was not drinking for fun I was doing it to suppress shit and not feel.I was drunk mostly from April through May and in June a little too but that is when I slowed down mostly. Now it feels like a need just to do it, I just wan to be drunk right now. Fuck this sucks even thinking about it makes me want to say fuck it and get drunk. it is all mental too like physically idk if I want that but mentally I want it if that makes sense.

11215,"Hi. I really have not done a post before, so this is my first time. But that being said I am kind of struggling. I have been feeling kind of worthless, but I want to do stuff to help others. My grades are doing terribly, and I am taking five summer classes to try and get more hours and pull up my grades. Also, my parents are living overseas with two of my little brothers, and the other little (21 year old) brother, J, is living with me in the house that my parents are letting us use. I only just started getting migraines this year due to stress. Within the last three weeks, my car is broken down, and I have had to use my parents nice car; I had to quit my job at my next door neighbors house so that I could take care of summer classes; I started falling behind on some of my online class work because I had to take care of the house as my brother now only seems to care about our pets and his job and his video games - we have zero clean dishes left, and low on laundry, and I had to spray for cockroaches as we live in the woods and they decided to come to visit yesterday.The other day I spent about 2.5 hours cleaning the bathroom that he uses if he finally agreed to do the dishes. He did, but its been about a week and they still are not done - because he has not touched them, and has only added to them. I have not been in touch as much with my mom because I have been so crazy busy trying to take care of everything else. J got the Covid vaccine, which would have been fine and I would be thrilled for and proud of him actually doing something good in his life, except he did not tell me he got it until after he got it and it was feeling horribly sick and nauseated. I was trying to take care of him, but then he was talking about how I was not doing enough. The day before yesterday, my brain had a temporary disconnect from reality, due to the amount of stress, where I felt like I was in limbo, and everything was spacey, and nothing felt real. Then I got an asthma attack and a migraine after taking the dog out for a run. Finally I texted my mom to let her know a light version of what is going on, because she is my mom, and you expect your mom to at least be there for you. Yesterday, I tried to do a group chat with my mom talking about what was going on. What happened next was is she blamed it on my stress of school and she just took Js side rather than actually hearing and listening to what I had to say, and saying that I was not being supportive enough towards him, and then I just needed to let everything go and forget about the dishes, and the stress, and my emotional problems and focus on him which, while I understood her reasoning, really hurt and made me feel even more kind of worthless.. I was so frustrated, that I backed out of the group chat and said I needed to leave to finish homework. Insert on the kitchen chair for a bit and cried. And then the fermenting plastic containers of peaches,from bout three or four days ago, that my brother forgot to tell me about but put in plastic bags on the floor (I thought it was just cans of food that he was going to give to our neighbors since that is what he would told me), exploded all over the kitchen floor, creating a very sticky mess that I am going to have to clean up. And I just feel worthless right now, and uncared for, and small, and kind of burdened down right now. I am not trying to burden anybody else with my problems, but I do not know who else to talk to, since no one else is willing to listen. Not sure what to do.",Depression

For example, that movie was ""Egg""celent !. Some people really do like it and genuinely laugh.I also asked a lot of questions regarding social life and it seems to make some people annoyed and complained about me. The questions I ask are simple questions such as ""Do you think my shirt is alright to go to the event ?"". But people can ask me a lot of question regarding ukulele but no one ever said anything about it ! I once lash out before that why you guys get angry when I ask questions when I answer all of your questions politely. They replied with my questions all the ukulele questions are ""good questions"" and my questions are all ""stupid"" questions.There are cases too where people seen me entering or exiting a mental health facilities and people became uncomfortable with me, saying I am very dangerous.

I feel so broken and lost all I can do is cry and think of how terrible I am. Its every day these thoughts of hating myself run on replay in my mind.

11227,"Summary: I felt great but then I called the cops on my friend for sexual assault (some nsfw) which they took extremely seriously and I do not want to go to court. Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet, there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her, I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke, I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared, I cannot go to court, I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record, not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though, my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago, like really happy and confident, I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy, like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court. I want to live and I want to be happy but I am so scared and do not think I can do it I really need help right now because everything is going wrong",Depression
11230,"I had a pretty bad mental breakdown last week, and my psych (whom I really trust) added two things to my treatment.I am on Bupropion 300mg which I love.She also gave me Eszoplicone for sleeping (worked but it made me very tired). I used to take zolpidem but my anxiety was so bad it would not work. This worked but I still slept terribly, waking up every two hours, vivid dreams, drowsy brain, etc.She also gave me an anti psychotic (Abilify). My experience in the past with them has been quite bad. I took quetiapine and one week later I told her I never wanted it again. I have experience **the** worst feelings when I took anti psychotics.I also read they are not so common to treat depression and anxiety and seem to be given more to people with well... psychosis?

But things have been getting worse and now I am just losing my appetite everyday and even if I am hungry I have gotten to the point where i hardly even let myself eat anymore. Also I have been trying to talk to my friend but it feels like she just ignores me. She always leaves me on delivered for a day or more even if she is the one to start the conversation. And my feelings for her have just been growing more and more and it is really getting on my nerves holding everything back. I want to talk to her but as soon as I get a reply from her I feel really anxious and do not know what to do then regret even starting the conversation not because I do not like its just because I am so anxious. I tried to stop watching porn but now I think I am watching it more than before and then afterwards I feel really really bad and disgisted in myself and just look down on myself for the next 30 minutes.

I feel like I am being swallowed up whole and there just is not anything that I can do about it. It does not help either that I bottle up all my emotions and then turn around and cry myself to sleep every night bc of how horrible I feel about myself. Like somehow everything and anything bad that has happened to me is somehow my fault and that I deserve it. I truly feel that I do not deserve to be happy or that I am worthy enough to be loved in any kind of way.None of my best friends really understand the pain I have been feeling nor have any of them cared to connect the dots that I disconnected myself from all of my social media platforms. I do not blame tho, I get that everyone else is just living their lives but it would be nice for someone to notice that I am not myself anymore and have not been for a long time. Although I feel so alone, I do have one person in my life that I can always turn to and that would be my dad. Yet, I am ashamed to admit to him how low I feel all the time and that what I am feeling is far beyond my own personal control at this point.

Amongst my mental health issues are lots of variables at play including co-morbidity such as OCD, GAD, PTSD, Bi-Polar but at the end of the day, no matter what treatments I received, (therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists), the depression became treatment resistant. So far the best years of my life were the last year of high school and all of my twenties. Unfortunately I had to make a bunch of very difficult decisions that all seems to happen at once. , my car got totalled with me in it (thank you fxcking Nissan Pathfinder trying to turn right from a left lane and took my Mazda along with him.

11253,"Well, I guess I am nearing the end now. Sometime within the next 3 years I hope, I will be dead. I have started cutting my friends off and mentally preparing for when it comes. After all, if I have nothing to fall back on, then I will just attempt again naturally and one of those will be my last.When I try thinking about actually killing myself, a million thoughts run my mind. What happens after? Where do we go? What will my family think? Especially the uncertainty after death, is keeping me alive. Maybe we reincarnate, and maybe I will end up luckier than this life. I am supposed to live until 80, yet how am I to survive that long if I cannot even think about living to see adulthood? 4 years until I turn 18, but everyday feels like an entire lifetime of pain, I am supposed to live 66 more years of this?None of it feels worth it, I have become so lethargic that getting out of bed to eat has become a hard task. Nothing feels necessary, at least for my life. Even if I had some kind of prophecy to fill, what do I receive, what is the point? Is it the journey, could it be salvation? Because if this is the path they gave me, it better be some heavenly reward.Sometimes I wish I could not have the power to reason, to think. But I think the life of an animal to be even more monotonous and bland than my own. So I am stuck between being able to reason and think about my thoughts, but having a vivid and unique life; and having an almost mindless and empty life. Though that does not mean an animal would care, they just do what they are meant to, survive. Sometimes that is what I wish I can do, like at a flick of a switch. Isolate and live as if I were only living to live and survive, not having to think. Unfortunately, that is not a life society sees to be useful or productive, so I hope to be reborn as an animal of the sea. While it does not matter what I think now, I would like to be born as a dolphin as opposed to a lion, the ocean is vastly mysterious and unexplored; land is mostly explored and uninteresting(to me).My death will probably be a while away, but it brings me peace to plan and prepare for when the day comes. For now, I guess I am sticking around. That is all, Thank you. Isolation, planning, and life after death.",Suicidal

11261,"Hi there. At one point in my life not so long ago, I was worried that I lacked all drive. I had no desire to do anything, to improve, to go forward. I thought that I was doomed to apathy.Now, my issue is a little different. I wanted to have desires, and I got them. Finally, I have goals and hopes and dreams. But I cannot seem to pursue them. I cannot sit down and do work. I cannot focus. I cannot get the will to make even one small move towards where I want to be, and in many ways, this is worse than not having any drive at all. I feel like a climber who wants to hike a mountain so *badly*, but my mind holds me back from ever taking that first step.And this is not really a motivation thing. I can tell myself a thousand times that I need to start going, and I just cannot.

11277,"I really do not know where to begin. I am 38 years old and on my second marriage (this will be explained in detail) This marriage also includes a 6 year child (that is not mine by blood but I still claim as my own). I am feeling really down right now and there has not been anything that can lift me up as I keep finding shit that brings me down. I am really trying to find to positive side of things but it just has not been possible. Now, here is a long story of why I just cannot seem to get a break...My first marriage was medicare at first. I honestly did not want to be with her but she won me over and I married her.. We had many years of happiness and life events (buying house, cars, etc). I ended up losing my job and joining the army to make ends meet and try to progress our status in life. I was gone from home for at least a year for training then another 6 months for orders due to premobilization of my unit. Shortly after I was off to iraq for 16 months. Needless to say I was away from my wife and home for quite a long while but I was paying the bills and trying to give her a life she enjoyed.During my mid tour leave I decided to give her a chance to ""come clean"" with any doings that I would have a major problem about (mainly cheating). She said she started smoking weed but that was all... I do not mind weed but I did not want her hobby to interfere with my security clearance so I asked her to stop by the time I got home. Fast forward a while and I found out through her computer that she was sexting another guy, a cop (this will play a part later in the story) and they were sending pictures and videos back and forth along with skyping all dating back to the time I was in Iraq. The first time I found out abou it I told her I wanted a divorce and left our house to live with my friend. She made a Deal with me that she would go through an uncontested divorce if I moved back in and went to marriage counseling. If that did not work out then she would grant me my divorce. Win win for me I thought....One of the conditions of the consousling was I was able to check her phone whenever I wanted to assure myself that no communication was happening with the cop. I did not find any for months. But I decided to put her to a test and see deleted the dude from her Facebook. All while making sure that I could see her text messages even if she deleted them. It was not but hours before I found the first text between them. They were not suppose to be communicating at all and she was trying to hide her tracks by deleting her messages. Then I laid another trap, I left for military stuff for a month or so and decided to ask her for nude pictures. My goal was to see if she sent the pictures to the cop. I got the pictures I asked for, and so did the cop... I immediately started the procedure to divorce this woman... Now on the the part that hurts the most. I found a woman that made me so happy and I found her during the finalization of my divorce. This woman was everything straight from the start. I told her ever single detail of my life and everything between. I even left the military for this woman ( I wanted a family and the military is not conducive to that). She already had a baby but that was fine with me. I fell so in love with this woman I asked her to marry me. We got got married, then tragedy, again.Our young relationship did have quite a strain. We bought new build houses twice within 2 years and then our house was hit with a tornado. We lost a friendship with someone that took us in to live with them, we lived in a hotel for a few months then covid hit and everything locked down. We managed to move into an apartment during this time but it was still difficult. I managed to get t-boned in my truck in which I broke 3 ribs, punctured a lung, and was knocked un conscious. So we had that to deal with. Eventually my new family found its way back into out newest ""tornado"" house. After we worked so hard to get it repaired.Mere months later I found out my wife was sexting with a cop. Keep in mind, this is wife #2 now, doing the same thing as wife #1. We are in marriage counseling now but it does not feel like it is helping. As of late I have been asking her if she is still thinking about this guy and she is flat out lieing about it.Tonight I found it she was upset over the fact that this shitbag found another girlfriend and that she thinks about him everyday and that she 100% knew there was a connection between them.Also, fuck sexlife on Netflix because she feels that while the physical portion of that show did not happen, the mental part did with the cop, I found that out tonight as well so yay me...

After that it now comes in episodes. Sometimes these episodes are extreme (like right now because I have lost a family, people on tumblr spread false information about me, witch hunt me, I am all alone and I am getting doxxed), medium or mild. Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short: Yes, I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me (that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now) and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus.

I am no softy but I wish I had someone that I could just be vulnerable around and not only be cared by, but care for. I am moving in about a month anyways so it makes no sense to try and get into a relationship but the new job I am starting will make it very difficult to start a long term relationship. I wish I had a cuddle buddy if anything. Totally non-sexual, uninvolved, but just someone that I can turn on a movie with and snuggle up against. Maybe fall asleep. I feel totally pathetic writing that but it could not be closer to the truth. It seems that all I am really good at is getting angry, being angry, and feeling like an asshole when I know I am anything but. I am 99% sure the reason for this is that my dad is mostly a good guy, that can get REALLY angry, but only when someone is being beyond stupid or inconsiderate. I guess I rationalized this as being mad = being right, and if someone pisses *me* off, out of all people, it must be for a good reason. it is really just me being on a power trip for a short moment because otherwise I feel incompetent at most shit. I think I just like being mad because it gives me some sense of superiority, and also because deep down, I am just secretly a lonely, hurt man who is tired of having to hide his emotions.I guess I will end it off on some good news. I love running. there is countless trails I run on that no one else really goes on, so I just leave my phone at home or in the car, and just go. I feel so free. And at the end of each one, there is always a beautiful view waiting for me, so I take a break and just kind of stare off and appreciate it before heading back home and enjoying my short-lived runners high. I am also pretty good at basketball and enjoy playing it. that is really the only time I am happy most days, otherwise it is just constantly checking my phone to no new texts, and playing video games and patiently waiting to head to bed just to not sleep.

They feel like absolute shit for not telling me in the first place and profusely apologized. They also were in major denial when they noticed they were aromantic and saw our relationship as a way to try and be normal (being aro is completely normal and okay by the way). They soon started to feel sick for not telling me this and felt terrible after noticing they should not of forced a relationship on themself.

He always suspected that everyone is planning something against him, but when my mom comforted him, he took that also in a negative way and blamed her for no reason.

It feels like my whole body is burning and I always mitigate this by punching in the air, as if I am beating someone brutally and it goes on for 15-30 mins kind of imagine it like flash pictures, happens mainly in the night before I sleep.

Or (been) in a similar situation?TLDR: can barely afford a place to live + food + meds. Taken out a good amount of debt just to survive and cannot take out any more credit cards. Am in constant pain but doctors do not care enough to do anything for me. Only reason I have not killed myself is my gf and my dog because I am all they have. Spend all day working an exhausting job I hate while being treated like shit for shit pay while fighting back tears and suicidal thoughts.

11311,"I have been on new medication for the past 2 months and I thought it was genuinely helping my mentally state. I did not seem to be weighed down by a lead anchor of despair and sadness. The woes of the world did not seem to demotivate me like they used to, to an almost debilitating degree. I even landed a job interview at a place that would have been pretty stable income. I felt a genuine sense of progression and growth. Today, everything came back and hit me like a freight train. I did not land that job, as soon as that news entered my headspace, it seems like all effect of the meds dissipated. That shit must have been a fucking placebo because now I feel just like I used to 2 months ago. I am so scared for the future. I fear there is only greater deals of pain and suffering to come for humanity, we clearly do not care enough about each other, and those in power actively despise the rest of us. They would gladly watch us slowly rot to death than let us have anything more than mere breadcrumbs. I have no hope that things will ever change for the better. I am so lonely, I just want to love and be loved. I just want somebody to care and to care for, to hug, and to cuddle with and look up at the night sky, or watch the sunset and feel at least a temporary sense of peace, love, and safety in this traumatizing world. I do not know how much longer I can keep getting up out of bed everyday when I cannot stand existing. Sleep is the highlight of my life at this point. I wish I could stay asleep forever. And maybe wake up in a perpetual dream world of being in bed with my soul mate, laying there watching the sunset on our own little private hideaway.I am not sure what venting here will do, venting has not really helped much in the past. I guess this the only place someone who I do not have to pay $80 a session might listen and give a fuck for a single moment. I do not know. I am so close to being done.

11317,"over the past year I have lost every single one of my friends. most were friends that were insignificant and i was not impacted by my loss. but 2 of the people i cared about most, one recently, completely ghosted me and left my life so fast its like they were not even there in the first place. i do not know what it is about me that repels people. so many of my old friends who completely betrayed me and fucked up my life and my self image are out with their own friends living their lives and having fun. and I am at home, sleeping in every day so i do not have to face my own loneliness. my best friend moved a state away a few years ago and were growing more distant every day. my boyfriend and i are on and off, and i have no one to rely on at all. i never thought i would face true loneliness but i am and its worse than anything i could have ever imagined. i do not see a point in living this way when no one cares about me. some people say oh i have no friends I am so alone when they really are not and they do not really know what true loneliness is like. seeing people i care about and getting out of the house helps my depression become more manageable but all summer I have been alone and at one of the worst points in my life and i genuinely do not know what to do.

I wish it was not so taboo. I wish it was not seen as selfish, but it hurts to keep living.

Or at least I think I am. I am not sure anymore. Maybe this is something everyone goes through and I am just overreacting. I do prefer to be asleep, there is a certain bliss with sleep.

But it is hard to stay motivated too long.I can distract myself, with games, working out. But I question if distracting yourself by being busy, even productive busy, is any real way to live. Is it really living if I avoid the pain, bury it inside, and go on with my life pretending to be normal? I cannot tell if that is the right answer.

11330,"Tomorrow's my last shift at a job that had become nothing but a source of anger, frustration, and toxic energy that turned me into a person I do not want to be anymore. I recently went on a family trip and I was actively angry that I had to go back to working there when I got back. A week later I put in my notice. No regrets on getting out of a situation that made me feel like I was going through the motions, like I was just a character in a video game playing out my script until clocking out, like my input or ideas or suggestions were not listened to or ""I agree with you but (other person) said no"".No regrets, that is, other than leaving when I had nothing else lined up after. Now it feels like the only jobs I will ever be able to get are things that I will end up hating just as much. And the career path I would like to pursue is impractical, untenable, unrealistic, and I should just stop fooling myself into thinking it is possible, so I might as well just accept that I am never going to be happy in what I do for a living.I had been telling myself that I needed to get the 900-pound gorilla off my back before I could move on in a healthy way. Nope, you just could not put up with a standard retail job. Get over yourself, your dreams are pointless, just give up now, and put the customer service voice back on.I would been telling myself ""do not leave a job unless you have another job"". Yeah, and you did not ever look for other jobs while you were working because you were too stressed out and exhausted (or more realistically lazy and like to complain) from your current job that thinking about work became the last thing you wanted to do so you would just wallow in it. And now that you are at the exit ramp, you still have nothing to show for it. Why? Because you are fucking lazy and you need to accept the fact that this is all you are ever going to be. Just give up and get back to work.I would been telling myself ""work yourself out of a job so they will either have to promote you or you go somewhere else and do the next step on that ladder"". Even if they did promote you, that just would have kept you stuck there even longer, or if you went somewhere else you would be still doing the same thing you hate. Which is the only thing you are ever going to get paid to do, anyway, so suck it up and put the tags back on.The only thing I have *ever* truly wanted to do with my life, and I mean across all of my years of existence, is to put on a show, make people laugh, and help them forget about their problems for a while. But I am not a good enough actor/writer/comedian/performer/anything to get paid to do that for anyone else, I know I would never succeed trying to start something on my own, and the wild card option I keep toying with is unrealistic (for many reasons), most notably because I am already probably too old to start and I would be even older by the time I was good enough.So I might as well just accept that all I am ever meant to do is suck it up, accept my fate, and go through the motions of living doing something that will never let me be happy. Tomorrow's my last day at my job, I do not have anything else lined up, and I see no hope.",Depression
11336,"As soon as I start to feel comfortable with the way I look, I start to notice all my flaws again and then feel stupid for even thinking I was pretty in the first place. I am just so tired of always comparing myself to other women my age and feeling like Ill never be good enough for anyone because I am not as beautiful or as fit as them. I am sick of being so insecure that I always think any man I am with would leave me for someone else because I am far from being as pretty as some of the girls I see. Or Ill see these women and feel bad for my s/o because they are with me when they could be with someone so much better. I hate feeling ugly all the damn time and idk how to stop. But then when I do feel good about myself, I question if I am really as pretty as I think I am or if I am just lying to myself. I just want to feel beautiful in my own skin and I want to stop comparing myself to other girls. It fucking sucks because I know my heart would break if someone told me they felt this way about themselves so why is it so fucking hard for me to stop hating myself? I do not want to live the rest of my life thinking I am this hideous mofo.

11338,"Lately I have been feeling very listless and like an absolute failure in every department. I am a survivor of child abuse and I thought after escaping that, the remnants of my family would be okay and we would be fine and that was the last big battle I had to fight.. I went to college like I was told to. It was fine, but I got a useless degree (German). I got my masters in teaching but it has been impossible to find a district teaching job. Student loan payments are coming due and I already barely squeak by on my meager charter school salary of 36k. Sadly, this is not all that is wrong. I am fat and have struggled with bulimia and body dysmorphia. Not to mention having a million acne scars all over my body. No one has ever loved me more than a one night stand. I am probably the ugliest person alive. In the gay community I am the picture of repulsive. I do not blame anyone but myself. The ptsd nightmares never stop. I am the only one in my family who is not with a long term partner. I want kids so bad but I am getting too old (I am 27). I do not want to become a parent when I am too old. I have tried everything to lose weight and nothing works. I have arthritis so working out is so hard, plus I am so shy that I am mortified of people looking at me while exercising.Everything is going wrong, I am so poor, and fat, and ugly that it just really feels like there is no point. I have to take so much medicine to keep my mental health from crippling me, and it makes me feel like I am nothing more than damaged goods. I just feel like such a burden to everyone and everything and I really do just feel like it would be best if I spared everyone from dealing with my worthless self. Because of my obesity I will probably die young anyway. I just want to find a way to make it look accidental, to spare my family a bit. I am sorry this is long I do not know",Suicidal

11353,"I dream a lot nowadays.. I dream when I am awake and I dream when I am asleep. I dream when I am working, and when I am doing nothing at all. At first it felt nice.. dreaming all day and night. Forgetting reality and thriving in another world, as another person. There, in those dreams I could be everything I wish I was now.. it was- and is still so welcoming. But slowly- daydream after daydream i forget that it is not real.. I forget that those emotions and people- that this world I created is not real.. Ill see my surroundings change- when I am taking a walk outside all of a sudden I am in a forbidden forest. When i look down to my clothes I am wearing a corset and dress, instead of the jeans and crop top I wear out.. and then Ill whisper words to no one but in my day dream I speak normally and with a friend. Ill wave my hands, and Ill cry and feel every emotion in my bones, as if it were real. Then all of a sudden I am dragged back into reality, my mind still hardwired to that of my daydream and I think things like when I find a dragon or of course! The Bermuda Triangle is where all the mythical creatures hide themselves away from humans! And I forget that it is not real. That in reality that type of magic does not exist. Then I fall into depression again as I remember my life is not like the books I read.. even as a witch who communicates with her gods- the type of magic where you just wave your hands and everything is suddenly clean and put together is not true- that fairies are not real and werewolves and dragons do not exist. I forget to often- what is real and what is not, the lines they blur and i fear I am going crazy. Like I am split between another reality and this one. Escapism has become to much, instead of the great coping mechanism it was- its started to slowly kill me.. is it wrong of me to want to let these daydreams overwhelm me.. is it wrong that I want to stay in them forever.. never waking from them.. I want to let them drag me away, kill me, and overwhelm me.. all because I do not wish to face reality again.

11356,"I am an 18 year old trans guy. I do not think words can appropriately express how much I fucking hate myself. I know I am never going to be a real man, and I am never going to be attractive to anyone but my current partner. Cis guys work out to get ripped and hot. I work out just for my body to remotely resemble that of a man. I know that in order to look like a guy I am going to need thousands of dollars of surgery, including plastic surgery to masculinizar my face. I have been on testosterone for more or less a year and all that is improved is a little bit of hair and a slightly deeper voice. I feel like a mutilated hairy woman. I feel disgusting. I come across gay men in the internet who would never accept me as one of them much less be attracted to me. I feel like a total fraud. Everyone at work respects my pronouns but only because its company policy, not because they see me as a real man. The more testosterone I take, the worse my acne gets, and the more bloated I become, this driving me towards worse self esteem. I know the effort necessary for me to be passable and attractive is so much that I would have to center my life around it and make enormous sacrifices to do so. I also dropped out of high school my senior year. I had a 4.2 weighted gpa, tons of AP classes, countless teachers ready to write me shining letters of recommendation. I was President and founder of my schools film club, I was an activist and a member of many other student clubs and organizations. I was on numerous occasions pulled aside by various teachers to be told I was a favorite student and that I was going places. I was also heavily involved in volunteering and was even appointed to leadership positions within the organization I volunteered with outside of school. I scored 5s on all of my AP tests and was often the only one in my year to do so. This year as my former peers are graduating, I am scrolling through their Instagram pages as I get off a 9 hour shift at my shitty restaurant job. I see that multiple of my peers are attending ivy leagues and other schools of similar ranking. This confirms what I long suspected and longed for - I could have easily been admitted to many of the top schools that my peers got into seeing as I outperformed the vast majority of them both in academics and in extracurricular activities. I really fucked that up. But at the same time I intensely hate all of those people I attended school with and am glad I am not surrounded with the likes of them anymore. Why? Because the majority of them were super privileged neoliberal assholes that ostracized me for being different and only tolerated me because I was smart and over-achieving. To make matters worse I honestly miss a lot of aspects of being a girl. I was always the best dressed in school but I never got verbal attention for it because I was an outsider. Instead people just stared at me as I walked down the halls with high heels and a perfectly curated vintage outfit. I had the perfect female body and a pretty face. Even though I was always uncomfortable and everything felt like a performative sham, I was insulated from the outside world and I felt like I had some value. Now i just feel like a chubby, unattractive, worthless blob. Its disgusting . I was also severely depressed and anorexic before my transition and although the anorexia has since disappeared I almost miss it. Its gotten to the point that my self esteem is so low that I cannot orgasm unless my boyfriend calls me a fag or puts his hand across my mouth (which I ask him to do by the way). Now he sometimes refuses because hes seen the effect it has on me so instead I just imagine it even more degrading in my head.

11364,"At one point I was having fun doing these things. Its true that robotics competition taught me useful skills like how to code and build, but I was more obsessed with actually winning than learning. Unfortunately for younger me, school teams coaches were focused on ensuring every student learned something and I never had teammates that were super passionate about winning the competition. In hindsight, Its not like winning really mattered anyway. Now for video games, i do not think playing them is bad until you start playing them to avoid your problems in real life or with the dream to go pro in some esport title. I wish I had realized that before i spent thousands of hours alone in front of the screen honing my skills. I never actually stuck to the same game either, i just played whatever was trending at my school during the time. I suppose I was the best there at competitive, but that is a pretty meaningless title. Compared to the rest of the country I am nothing.I used anime/tv and youtube as a means to escape reality as well.

11368,I left my previous job because of COVID 19 concerns last Year and having to help family and such. It was my choice to leave but given the pandemic my old job was unable to transfer me to another position. I went through a small phase of depression after I left thinking it was momentary. I started a new job in the same field. Thinking that if I got back in the swing of things I could rid myself of depression and be productive again. Its the complete opposite of what I thought it would be. The people who I work with openly do not like me because of my association with my previous organization. Yes we are all adults and I cannot push off negative comments because I do not care but it makes me miss my old job and the environment and positivity that was there. Its almost been a year now since I started at this new job but I am finding myself crying more and more because I am so depressed from missing my old job. It was a calling and I loved what I did. I keep trying to tell myself to hang in there and it was just a right choice at the wrong time but I am still struggling even though I am doing something similar to what I was doing. I know this all sounds silly but I am trying to decide whether taking the risks to try to go back outweighs any negative backlash I may receive from those I work with.

I do not want to make this post too long or anything but this really is the last thing I need right now and all of my suicidal thoughts are coming back and I do not know what to do. Growing up I had almost no self esteem, I am barely 5'5"" in a family of tall people and up until last year I was overweight. I have struggled with depression since I was 14 as well, and I let myself go all through high school. I am gay, and still not out of the closet, so I had no reason to want to even try to look nice up until last year.I decided that I was sick of being lonely so I started to work on myself, I got in shape, I bought clothes for the first time in three years or so, and I started to do my hair for once. It was all going great, and I started to feel pretty good about myself. Up until three or four months ago, when my hair started to fall out in droves. I went from having a thick, nice head of hair, to now being at the point that you can pretty much see my scalp no matter how I do my hair. I am devastated. Just when I started to care about myself, and try to get out and meet people, and maybe even start trying to date, this has to happen. I have gone to my doctor and got blood work and all that, and the verdict is it is genetic and just coming on strong. I do not have money for implants, and even if some ointment or whatever works my hair is already so far gone I am afraid it will not ever be the same. I do not want to do this anymore. Every time I start to feel happy or at peace with myself something happens and tears me down to nothing. All I can think about is killing myself now, again. The medicine does not work at all. I have tried a cocktail of anti depressants and this always happens. There is no happy pill, life is always going to suck no matter what my attitude towards it is. It feels like someone is watching me in some Truman show scenario and fucking with aspects of my life to drive me to suicide. I am so alone, and losing my hair is the nail in the coffin. I work construction, do not interact with anyone but my boss, one coworker and my family, and I am unattractive. I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. My teens and 20s were supposed to be the happiest of my life and I have only spent them miserable. I do not want to live another 50-60 years like this.The good moments just have not been worth dealing with all the misery to get to them.

I keep randomly bursting into tears in my room alone and then calming down and then sobbing again 10 minutes later. This is high school all over again and I do not want this. there is so much else on my mind right now besides the hair but the hair is what is finally pushing me over the edge.

I have been mostly socially isolated since I was around 11 due to my parents feeling it was necessary for me to be home schooled due to severe bullying (I was severely injured by a group of older students, so I can kind of see why?) but it was mainly my dads decision with my mom not liking the idea, even though I stated multiple times on how I feel homeschooling is a mistake and will only lead to failure, 4 years later and now it feels like ill never be able to fit into society again, I mean I have completely forgotten how to talk to people. This year I have convinced my mom to put me back in due to my ""dad"" not being as close to the family. But at what cost? All I want now is death, plain and simple. All I know is I am not living past the age of 21, It feels as if I am destined to kill myself, no other ways out I must take my own life to escape this hell. I know even later on in life that if my mother dies its all over for me, so why even give birth to me in the first place?I have argued with my mom about how you should not have children if you are incapable of giving them a good childhood and she usually uses the same bullshit excuse of ""Well I know I could not be a good mom back then so now I will try to be a good mom now"" No, those were meant to be the best years of my life, before I had responsibilities before I was even thinking about the future. For those who are wondering my Mom and Dad divorced pretty young in my life, I mean so early on that I do not even fucking remember them being together. Something about my dad having some mental health issues and being extremely violent but even still they stayed in contact due to them obviously having to ""take care of me and my 2 older siblings"". Now for most of my early years whenever my mother had a problem with how I was acting instead of dealing with it herself she would just drop me off at my fathers house and let him deal with it. Now not to mention that his shitty old house was filled with bugs to the point where I could not sleep and had reoccurring nightmares about small little bugs crawling all over me and I would wake up in a panic. Not to mention he was pretty verbally abusive. Pretty much the average shitty father shebang. There is a lot of what hes said to me and done to me that I never told my mom and kept inside and I still do. I mean for example one of the things hes said to me is ""If you turn out to be some gay disappointment I will crush your fucking skull and I do not care if I go to prison because it will be better then knowing that I raised a shitbag"" Keep in mind I was 11 years old, and well it obviously worked because I am extremely afraid of even being friends with other guys. I have so much pent up sadness and anger that I just simply cannot express due to me not knowing how and being a emotionless person for so long. If I would have known back then that I could have called someone to get me out of this shithole I would have back then but now there is not even much of a point because the damage has already been done.I have never gotten therapy or anything because I never said anything because I was so young I did not understand what any of this meant and since it was so long ago I do not know how to bring up this trauma and all of this other feelings of sadness and guilt with my mother because for 1. How are you meant to bring something like that up to the same person who somewhat caused it, and 2. I would not even know how to bring something like that up because of my outwards image as a emotionless zombie. Which has lead to me seriously hurting myself mentally and psychically by cutting. I mean there is truly 0 hope, victim of obvious child abuse, lacking in education, socially inept there is is no way out I have 0 future. I mean I love my mom, she is changed so much in the last 2 years after she found out what my dad did to my older brother and has cut him out of our lives so I am not mad at her I just cannot trust her. I know I must die soon. I know all its going to take is for one thing to go wrong and then I am done, ill make that impulse decision and kill myself. Honestly my thoughts on death have changed so much since I was young. It went from ""holy shit I do not want to die"" to ""holy shit can someone fucking kill me already?"" I have already tried to overdose on Benadryl off of a impulse decision after a argument with my mom, rushed to hospital blah blah idk why anyone would try to save me but its still funny how my mom still did not question how I would even accidently take that much which just shows that nobody fucking cares. I have already planned how I will kill myself when I am feeling that impulse decision, I will take my belt and hang myself. Due to me being able to take some amount of psychical pain from me cutting myself I am sure I can handle that 2 minutes before I pass out from lack of oxygen. I mean the more and more I think about it the more appealing it sounds. I get to feel nothing! You know how awesome that sounds? I wish I could feel nothing today, unable to think or do just relax. I have not been relaxed in such a long time I would kill just to not feel tense. I do not think I have gotten more then 6 hours of sleep for the last couple of months which is just slowly driving me up the fucking wall. I am becoming more and more easily frustrated at the smallest things, I mean I got mad at not being able to find my razor to hurt myself its gotten so bad. I will fucking end it soon, I have lost the fear of death and now I am somewhat determined to kill myself. If I cannot hang myself then I will endure the pain until I am 21, buy a gun and will not fucking hesitate to blow my brains out the instant I come home that day. Its weird how I am not mad at anyone but myself, I ware my self down on everything. &amp;#x200B;I have been alone for so long, do I even want death? do I want to just escape from the problems? I just want a hug man, I just want someone that i can just fucking hug and cry and tell them all of my problems. I have too much trust issues with my mom to do that and my siblings are all way older then me and I have never been super close to them. I have never been super close to anyone i have never felt loved by someone not even myself what is the fucking point? it just sucks knowing that ill die a nobody fucking loser but its not like i can change it. sucks knowing that ill probably not make it past 2023 but who cares anymore everything becomes irrelevant when you are faced with death. if there is a higher being that decided they were going to give me a shit life then ill be the higher being to fucking take it away. abused early in life and feeling unloved. I want to fucking die. I have no future.",Suicidal

Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle. I had not seen a man more useless until i looked in the mirror. Have a nice day, i can assure you it will be better than mine I feel completely useless and hopeless. I am a joke of a person .

This is not a reflection on you or your parenting but just a reflection on how I see the world as it is right now and I do not like it. I see so much misery and pain. So much fog and I do not see anything in my way. You have given me so much but I feel like I am not worthy on this planet. I want to see Koda again. My best friend who still after 2 years after we had to put her down I cry and think about her. I want you to know I made a melody for her on my guitar and I played for her less than a day that she died. She must have loved it because I gave my all when I played it and I want to play it for her one more time and I want to know how she feels about it. A man's best friend is his dog, if he has nobody else and that was my girl, Koda! No animal has ever made me feel stupid and my friends have made me feel smart. Jack is my boy and I have always wanted him to be happy and the only task that I will give you is to honor him as my angel. Feed him honorably. Pet him and scratch his tummy. Give him regular walks. Bath him regularly. Love him 24/7. Please be patient with him. do not hit or yell. Please play with him!!!!To my lovely sisters I want you to know that I cherish the lovely days when we were kids. Playing Nintendo 64 together and watching you play meant the world to me and it still does. I have tried reconciling that joy thorough watching people stream but it has never brought up the memory of when we were little. Thank you for helping me and mothering me when I needed it the most. I will never forget the times when we huddled up crying and embracing each other while our parents fought. It did not scar me but I hate to remember those times when our parents hurled insults back at each other. Money now seems like such a waste. But anyways I want you to know that I care for you so much. I would do anything to make you feel safe. I am the baby of the family and have always felt like the black sheep. A gay man who was curse with fantasizing. My head can never shut up and I am fed up with it. No meds or therapy can take away the pain. Life is just a void of work and misery till you die. I could have a billion dollars in the bank but I know I would just be drinking eating and smoking till my inevitable passing. Die now in my prime or die after years of mental torture. I truly do not see another side to this. A final note id like to make is to my nephew Bryce. I want you to know sweety is that I have always loved you and care for you deeply. I missed those days when you under a year old and I was feeding, burping, bathing and changing you. I greatest moment ill never forget is when you had a big accident and poop was all over my arms but I want grossed out. I knew that was most important was to make sure you were safe and clean. I will never forget when I was giving you a bath in the sink and I turned to grab a rag on the floor and turn to see you peeing a fountain in the water and making eye contact with me and giggling. that is when I knew you were a special child with a great personality. Such a boy like your mother. I hope that you turn into a Warrior and not let anyone step in your way. You fight like a champion but you never throw the first fist or hurl the first insult. You are better than that. You be respectful and kill your enemies with kindness. Then ditch them to rot in the filth that is not towards you. Walk away.I love you all. Please cre mate me and throw my ashes with Koda in the ocean so we can be at peace together.

11389,"for over 2 years now as a straight girl I have been struggling with the realization that the majority of men whether they claim to be straight, bisexual, or gay, enjoy sex with men much more than they enjoy it with women. men nowadays do not show much interest in women at all. most men are far more sexually satisfied by men than women, and i feel like any man who says otherwise is in denial. this has been the because for multiple suicide attempts as i am in a relationship with my boyfriend and am very in love with him but live in terrible fear that he would deep down enjoy being with a man more than with me. i do not know what is wrong with me. i feel so unsexy, undesired, and so sexually unwanted. no one wants women sexually anymore. it hurts so bad. it makes me contemplate suicide every day, like why am i even trying if I will never be enough for any man? it is either that or it is the fact that men do not consider women to be funny, or cool, or worthy of any accomplishments. it makes me so sad. my boyfriend means the absolute world to me, i love him with all of my heart, and I am so attracted to him i have barely even felt sexual attraction to any other guy since I have known him. and to think that maybe i hypothetically am not the best he could get sexually makes me ache. maybe he would be better off if i died and left him to be with some hot guy, as all guys want nowadays. men even prefer femboys over girls now. it is like girls will never be enough. men are not even sexually into women anymore. feeling like shit as a girl, i feel so unwanted in this world.",Suicidal

11397,"I am 20 years old (M) and have been having recurring nightmares for the past month that my gay best friend (34M) blew me while I was blackout drunk and passed out. I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream, but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background: He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night, doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up, and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend, and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare, but it was not. I feel violated, in shock, devastated, enraged, and a million other emotions I cannot begin to describe. I do not know how to deal with this.

11398,"Tw: Suicidal IdeationLast weekend I met up with my ex who I used to (and still do) love very much. It was great for a day and a half...Then my anxiety started kicking in. I started over analyzing everything he did during the time we spent together. I started to ruminate. And now it feels like all of the progress I have made has gone down the drain. I was not exactly going upwards in the week proceeding the meetup either, but it was not this bad. I am currently on anti-depressants, but I feel like they are not helping right now. I had two panic attacks yesterday, over really stupid stuff that should not matter in the long run since what I was considering were hypotheticals anyway. I also got drunk for the first time tonight, and that felt good. Had some sloppy sex with an FWB, and it was good. And now I feel bad again. Empty. On the way over to his place, I started thinking about suicide again. Like what if I decided to take my antidepressants before I was fully sober again, and kill myself? What if I just stopped caring and drove my car into a pole at 50+ mph?Like, I cannot handle this. I have been in love with him for more than a year after our breakup. These feelings refuse to leave, no matter what I do. I have done talk therapy, I have gotten a new job, I have tried going to college, studying, working myself into the ground, getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy. All of it for a month or so at a time, and I just do not feel good. I have also tried the quick fixes, like pot, alcohol, and sex. Oh, and the anti-depressants.These things do help, do not get me wrong, but especially recently I have been feeling like utter crap. And these feelings because guilt, and because me to want to reach out to him, and I know my ex would not push me away, but I do not want to rely on him too much. And talking about these things somehow make it worse... And I feel entirely at a loss for how to express my emotions without annoying, burdening, or causing other people pain. Being in love is getting tiresome. Trying to move on is getting tiresome. Life is getting tiresome. And to be clear... I do not blame my ex for any of this. I reached out to him.

I am a really sensitive and analytical anxious type of person. my social anxiety has put me at a crossroads of wanting to improve and get better but finding that when i try, it never goes in a overall positive direction, or i end up regretting putting myself out there because I am worried i did the wrong thing or people will not like me. to put it to scale, my social anxiety is the type where when i go to the grocery store and people just glance at me, i start to hyperfixate on what they are thinking of me. or when I am squeezing past someone and i say sorry excuse me and they do not really acknowledge me, i start to think they do not like me because of x, y, and z. i do go to therapy but sometimes i find that even when i tell my therapist i want comfort and she gives me the i am proud of you i feel like i cannot tell her the negative, shitty, and depressive thoughts i have because she will not be proud of me or that she will judge me (which even though she has every right to, my anxiety hates when i think people are judging me). i say i am high functioning because i have an internship and i do run multiple clubs and i do try in school &amp; i do force myself to go out with my friends and put on a happy face to not worry them. reaching out to my friends are not an option because during the few times i did tell them about my sadness, i am met with a always here to talk but get declined calls and when i say I am doing bad in person, they never really know what to say, so the conversation ends at I have been feeling bad and a subject change happens. i have no hobbies because if I am not working, I am anxious and stressing and i just want to rest. i do not think I am in the mindset for hobby hunting even if that would be good for me.

But fuck that, man. there is literally no evidence, its just people cherry picking parts of the Bible to support what they want to do. But at the same time, I wish god would come down from the sky for one second and just tell me, hey, its okay. You can do this. But he will not because that is not what he thinks. I have no choice except to keep living as a woman. And Id rather kill myself.I have a plan to cut myself enough that I bleed to death tomorrow. And if that does not work, I am going to take a nice peaceful sit on the railroad outside of my house and wait for it to end. I do not want to live like this anymore.

11416,"Can I just say how lonely I am but its a huge contradictory because I cannot get along with most people and I am terrible in relationships because of trust issues and jealousy mostly. Not only that but social anxiety kills me in just about every situation. I have been sober for over 3 years and its a good thing because I have addiction problems that spiral out of control and effect my ""work life"" like I get fired or just stop showing up. I have no friends because I do not know how to talk to people casually and the only friends I ever had were people I drank or did drugs with and now I do not do that anymore. My one and only ex cheated on me with a friend of mine and I did not even see it coming. It was a huge shock to me and I was ""in love"" with her at the time. This was like 5 years ago and I have not been with anyone since and I still think about her and ""miss"" her even tho we do not talk. I take anti depressants but they do not work I am going to and I feel suicidal 50% of the time and I do not see a bright future for me like more loneliness and working for the weekend just to do everything or nothing by myself. Hypothetically if I were to get a girlfriend it would be more work than its worth to me because of constant worry about cheating or leaving me and then being right back to where I was. I am 33 year old male with nothing to live for, looking for some sort of advice or just to be heard I am not sure. Help? If that is possible",Suicidal
11420,"I have been friends with her since we were pre-teens and we have been friends for 10 years now. I was always the quiet one and she was more sociable and got along well with others and had quite a few other friends but we always stuck together throughout our teens, confiding so much to each other, right through to adulthood.&amp;#x200B;She got married today and we had not seen each other for a few months or messaged much since we have both been busy with assignments but checked in each other at least once a month by text. She introduced me to a college friend of hers at the wedding today and we got along. Everything was fine until they discussed the fact that college friend was sleeping over after the wedding. It was then explained to me and I was invited on the spot which of course I had to decline because I was not prepared at all. (she is staying at her family home for this night.)My heart is broken right now because it makes me sad that she would not ask me to sleep over after her wedding. She would not want her childhood friend, her oldest friend with her on that special moment, even if I was busy, she did not check if I could free up time. I have never been asked to sleep over at all over the years of our friendship.And to be honest, I know that it is my fault for not being nice company. I know that the college friend is so much more enjoyable than I am. she is more chatty and humorous and of course my friend would prefer her. I cannot blame her at all for it. I do not blame her really. it is my fault.Or maybe I gave her the wrong sign by not messaging enough? But really I think it is the former reason. I am going to try to be more enjoyable company and message her more but I do not think I will get over the sleepover thing for a while. &amp;#x200B;I just wanted to vent somewhere because I have been crying for a while. she is my only friend and I never thought that I would begin to lose her.

I have been riding rides all day and I have been eating without purging for two days. I did not want to ride the Simpsons ride (bc I get motion sick and could throw up) so I went off by myself to wait for them. I walked into krustys burgers, sat at a booth upstairs alone, and put my head down. I have been here for an hour. Its a busy day. Many people have walked past me. No one has come up to me. No one sat with me. My friends have not even asked me where I am. They all just let me be alone. Which is fine. I want to be alone so I do not understand why I am thinking about how no one has worried about me. I do not even want to be worried about. It sucks yknow? no matter how hard I try No matter how much I force myself.. I can not be happy. Depression always hits at some part of the day. And its exhausting pretending that I am having a good time when really, I just want to lay down. I do not want to fake the way I feel, but its not fair to them if I ruin the mood with my moodiness.

11425,"first of all, sorry for my English. it is not my first language and I am tired. I do not know where to start, do you know that feeling you have when you are super attached to a person and everything she/he does affects your mood? Well, I am there. I am fearing for her/him to abandon me, we are just friends but I am not sure when this happened, I just cannot be happy if we are in a bad spot on our relationship. And most of the times there is no ""bad spot"", it is just me destroying myself after over-thinking about a posts, or a bad response from him/her etc. The worst part of this is that the most important person in my life does not really have that same feeling for me. I know I am important to her/him, but not the same way, and it fucking hurts, I do not KNOW WHY. And I cannot make it stop. My life is nothing without him/her, and I am ashamed of myself for that, it is just ridiculous. I am even trying to change my body because maybe he/she will like me more. He/she never told me anything bad about my body, but I feel like I need to do it. My body is not bad tbh, but I want it better, not for me but for him/her.I need some advice, what does people do to end this? it is been a lot of time and I cannot see how to get out of this wheel. At this point I do not have anyone I can talk about this with, that is why I came to Reddit. it is super late here and I cannot sleep, my brain will not stop thinking about that person and how our conversation today was not good, I made him/her felt bad in some way and we did not talk much more. We are not angry at each other, but it was a but weird.

11426,"Most of my life I was, I believe, neurotypical with very few mental problems if any. That is until the pandemic. Last semester I was in dorms but due to covid they forced everyone to be alone in their room. No room mate, no visitors allowed, and you could not eat inside with others. With it being so cold, that meant you could not really eat outside either. Every day I would take my food from the dining hall back to my room and eat alone infront of my computer. If I hung out with friends I would risk losing my housing and being kicked off campus, so I mostly kept to myself. None of my classes were in person. Less than a month of being there I felt these terrible feelings i had never felt before. I felt deep loneliness and isolation and hopelessness. I felt suicidal for about a week and had multiple nights were I came close to attempting to take my life. After some time, I started to feel better. However throughout the entire semester I still felt traces of that loneliness and sadness. I have since moved home, and even now with family and friends and work to keep me busy, I still have regular multi day episodes where I feel empty inside and I feel like I have nothing to live for.Why is this still lingering with me? Can that one semester really be enough to because changes like that inside my head? Idk if I have depression and I am fairly certain I do not, but I have not tried getting diagnosed because it seems to be more of episodes rather than a constant thing. Can 4 months of isolation break your head?",Depression
11431,"Sorry this is long but I have to get it out.I have a dissociation disorder and I struggle with attachment/abandonment issues. A couple years ago I ended up in the youth psych ward. I got discharged and sent to this place called Woods Homes. It was a residential program for youth who have pretty bad mental health issues. Long story short, I got really attached to a couple of the staff there and sometimes they would leave without saying goodbye. That would always break me but I kept going because my favourite staff (J) was still there. When it came time for me to be discharged J informed me that she was also leaving. That broke my heart in a million pieces. me and her did have a decent goodbye but it still hurt just as bad. AnywaysLast weekend was really rough. My mind was spiralling. I was in such an intense physical, emotional, mental pain. I just wanted it to stop.My mind was just going over things that happened at woods (good and bad) over and over and over. My memories are what hurt me. The good ones hurt the most because it makes me realize I am never going to have that again. I am never going to find another J. Never going to see them again.With all this on my mind I wanted to end it. There was not a point to living without them in my life anymore. So I made a plan. I have attempted before but I have never made a plan. At least not a serious, detailed plan. Basically it was death by cop. I have a BB gun that looks exactly like a real gun with no orange tip. My plan was to go to read my confidential files from woods, go to woods, make a scene, have the cops come, Id say what I wanted to then Id point the gun and walk towards them. Bang.That never happened unfortunately. I ended up breaking down and dissociating. I was on autopilot and I ended up picking up my belt and tightening it around my neck. Even if I wanted to, I could not stop it. I was seeing spots and my vision was fading. Then I heard my cat outside my room. His meow pulled me out of my dissociation enough for me to undo the belt. It stayed around my neck for about 45 mins while I laid back and just sobbed. All of that did not change my mind though. I still wanted to bad to die. But I was too exhausted to do anything about it. After all that I smoked a huge dab and went for a walk still dissociated. I was hearing shit all around me, people walking, loud bangs and people yelling. I was seeing little shadow animals running across the road. But it was 4am and I live in a small town where the streets are absolutely dead at night. Just paranoia I guess. I ended up sitting on the sidewalk and dissociated then fell asleep. I got home around 6:15am. It was really a nightmare I was trapped in. The next day I was very physically sick. Just from the exhaustion and all the emotions I was feeling. could not do anything. I reached out to someone I work with at a life skills program and she graciously changed my appointment to monday. I went and saw her and gave her all my writing. After reading it she recommended I go to the hospital. I went to ER and waited for a day and a half before I got transferred to a short stay crisis stabilization unit. that is where I am currently. Its not helpful. I have been doing the work. I have been making an effort. But the staff do not seem to think that my problem is as big as I say it is. Everytime I have gone to the hospital and tell them what is going on the staff always look at me like really? that is it? Okay then its very frustrating. And usually leads to me making a scene on purpose so that they take me seriously. But then that leads to getting restrained and being put in high observation and getting tackled and getting a needle in your ass so you sleep for two days I have been through all this before and it was just as useless then. The problem is.. when I go home I know I am going to go right back into that state and want to carry out my plan. I feel so lost and hopeless. Not sure what to do anymore.Anyways. Thanks for reading.

11432,"I am 17F, Asian.For my entire childhood my mom has projected her insecurities onto me, a behavior which has manifested into relentless cruelty and emotional torture. She used to hit me a lot ( I still have a scar from when she hurled her keys at my face because I told a friend that she had called me a curse) but stopped when CPS came. She has incessantly berated and demeaned me for over a decade, to a point of viciousness words cannot describe. whether that is trying to force me to kill myself or calling me a worthless fucking idiot or shrieking at me that I am a maniac who everyone thinks should be locked up, the pain she has caused me is indescribable. every single day she terrorizes me with insults, comparisons, belittling, threats and manipulation. and I do not know if I will ever be able to recover from the anguish.but whenever I obey her she is nice to me and acts like a good mother. I know the love is real, albeit conditional, and it will disappear the moment things do not go her way. but I try so so hard to keep her in a good mood because I just need her affection so badly. I hate myself so much for this.my father is more normal but he has bursts of uncontrollable rage when things do not go his way. I try not to think about these times because other times he loves me very much. I would like to emphasize that he is very kind to me usually. But these outbursts include physical assault, smashing stuff, death threats, suicide threats, and really mean comments to me like 'I bet you get orgasms from destroying the family like the sociopath you are'.But that is not very common so I do not want to focus on that. what is more common is his enabling of my moms behavior. he always sat back in silence on his phone whenever my mom was shrieking at me and always pretended it never happened. he never validates my feelings and always jumps to comments like 'nothing will ever satisfy you' and 'your mom does so much for you why are you so ungrateful you bitch'. he always sided with her and her bullshit narrative about the family dynamic (essentially I ruined everyone is happiness). It is so frustrating especially when I am begging and crying for him to intervene but he just tells me to shut up and go away and listen to my mother.anyway yesterday my mom was screaming at me as usual because I had not finished a college essay draft. she said something along the lines of how my dad always tells her how he thinks I should be locked up in a mental institution, how he wishes he had his friends daughters instead of me and how he cannot wait for me to be out of his life. I felt really sad about this for some reason even though they have said things like this to me since I was 9.My dad was driving me back home from a dr appt today when I for some dumbass reason asked him if what he had said was true. he obviously got very defensive and skirted around the question and claimed I was always searching for stuff to be mad about, that I was always blaming my problems on my parents, and he did not know what to do to satisfy me. this really upset me as all I want is a loving peaceful family. I will admit it, I called him a bad father. I was so angry by him invalidating me and making it look like such a simple request was absurd and ungrateful. I hate how they will always see me as overemotional and dramatic and selfish without ever looking inward and recognizing their flaws. well anyway that made him super mad and he basically said that he hated me and my mom, and marrying her was the worst decision of his life, that he had stopped loving her years ago and it was all my fault. He said that the family was not worth resurrecting and the only reason he had not left and/or killed himself was to preserve his reputation. When I got home I went and cried to my mother and told her she was right, that I am a failure, and I begged her to hug me. She hugged and kissed me and I felt so much better. She got impatient pretty fast but I did not care. i just wanted someone to love me. I feel so much self loathing for not being strong enough to withstand a family deprived of love. I hate that i am relinquishing my autonomy and purpose and strength just to feel some love from my parents. it sucks. Idk if this is depression or a coping mechanism or what. I do not know how to keep going on. anyway sorry for rant ty for reading if you got this far Both my parents are incredibly cruel to me but sometimes I am so desperate to fill the void I abandon all my morals and appease them so I can get some affection. I viscerally hate myself for this. Is that depression?",Depression
11435,"I do not know why am I writing this at 4AM in the morning but I really cannot keep it in and I have no one to talk to. Also I do not know if I have any mental disorders because I have never been to a therapist to get diagnosed. So here goes, I do not know what to do anymore.. Today I attended the engagement party of my life long friends ( have been friends for almost 18 years now ) and I am almost 25, do not know if it matters. Anyway, Everybody is having fun; singing and dancing with the couple while I am just sitting there doing nothing. I want to go up there and join them but I cannot for some reason.. at times like these I wish I were dead and it is funny to me how I am willing to die at those moments because I have a huge death anxiety problem going on.. so being driven to the point where I am okay with being dead makes me wonder ... Been like this for 10 years now. I cannot have fun, no matter what. Go to a trip with friends ? Everybody's having fun but guess who is not ? guess who is trying to enjoy his time but cannot ? even though I would be happy but i cannot bring myself to enjoy those times. I am sorry I do not know how to explain, I am probably an Idiot.

I was not like this before but I was not fine either. The problem just became more apparent I guess ?Guess being called a failure and judged for every decision you do in your life by your father ends up in me actually being a failure and I sadly cannot moveout cuz I am from a country where the culture does not allow that..I am not suicidal, I am convinced that there are a lot of good things and that life is worth living but I just cannot seem to enjoy it right now..I am sorry If this makes someone else sad but I really did not mean it..

11436,"This week iv been trying to contact my ex after, we were together for 3 years and it ended more than 2 years ago. 2 years of only a couple of texts when a family member died. She left me on read on my first message where I asked how she was. She left me on read on my second message where I explained my new diagnosis and how much better iv gotten.She left me on read on the 3. Message where I told her how important she is to me and how happy I am for her and how I understand and respect that she will not talk to me.But I do not really respect it, I cannot believe she does not talk to me. I took distance after she broke up with me. I texted her earlier this year but do not even know if she uses that number anymore so I went to messanger this time.I am actually disgusted and incredibly surprised that she acts this way. I do not understand at all.I am wondering if i should drive to her parents house which is 2 minutes away. I think she is home, she was a week ago my friend told me.

11437,"I have set a date for August 4. Simply for the sake of irony, since it is my birthday backwards. I got the helium tank, the plastic tube, the duct tape and the oven bags. Just waiting for the elastic chord that should arrive sometime next week. I have written two letters: one for a friend and one for several other friends. I think I should try to write something to my family, but I do not know what. The only ones in my family I truly love are my dad, my only grandma and one of my aunts. Perhaps one of my grandfathers, but I do not really know him. I do not love my mom, but it would probably break her heart if only my dad got a letter. I just do not have anything to say to her. So perhaps it is better to not write anything at all. My last will and testament is done. I have some laxatives I can take just before, to avoid making a mess. I wish I had some sedatives, but I have read that helium acts quickly. Maybe anxiety will not be that much of an issue.I feel so relieved. So calm. Soon it will all be over. I will not have to deal with being me anymore. Pretty soon I will just be a memory. Later on I will not be anything at all but someone who used to live for a while. I am sad I am going to have to hurt my loved ones. that is the only worry I have right now. I wish there was something I could do to cushion the blow for them. Finally going through with it",Suicidal
11438,"As the title says, I feel defeated. Ready to just end my life and never have to worry about this constant cycle of stress, only to see a glimmer of hope that gets crushed as soon as you think it is safe to reach for it. It genuinely feels like life, for me and people like me, in this society specifically, is only granted to prove that hope truly is not viable and that our lives and our beings are merely stepping stones for the more lucky.I used to genuinely love people. Deeply, unconditionally love people. I still do, but I hate to admit that because it makes me naive and open for hurt. And it extends to most all people, and before I could handle the fact that people are imperfect, that is fine, I can still handle that. I still feel that love for people in my life, even despite terrible low points. I have always been able to forgive, and distance, and move on if wronged. Not wishing bad on those who wronged me. I still do not. But that changed these past few years. I went into a deep depression, and I still have not gotten over past trauma my dysfunctional family inflicted on me. That they still inflict. Because I love them, and I forgive them and recognize what they did was wrong but I still care about them because we are all only human on this planet. there is always a reason and meaning, and people have good in them most of the time. If they do not expand it, I just distance but still wish for them to change and do what is best. So I distance, but the distance does not fix my mental state, or the distrust and pain that plagues me and my current relationships to others. I am secretive. I find that to be my biggest downfall. I never allow myself to be truly open, and I lock away deeply intimate parts of myself and the things I enjoy and love personally. I never share my writing, the things I enjoy most, or my media preferences. Even though it is all harmless, I keep it under wraps, and I know it is due to trauma from my upbringing. I can link it distinctly. Nobody would expect my death, and I know they would not because even my partner has no idea how debilitating my mental health gets. And it makes me angry, I feel burned. I am not able to be myself. I am not able to honestly connect with those in my day to day life. I was forced to hide most everything about me growing up, lest it be suppressed or judged harshly or used to hurt me. And I cannot do it anymore. I have lost so much of myself that I will never find those pieces again, to put myself back together whole. Words are only a temporary distraction before it all comes down to crush me again. And, for that, I know that without the 24/7 distractions of other people and work and hobbies I cannot function. I am not whole on my own, mentally or physically, I feel. My cousin committed suicide 5 years ago and it is like a mirror and some days I envy them. I envy that they escaped, and I hate myself for even being capable of thinking that way. I feel like a hypocrite, for thinking of doing what I have begged and convinced others not to do.I am currently unemployed due to the pandemic. Started taking care of a stray, now I have kittens to take care of as well. I cannot drive due to disability, which makes things harder, I feel too burdening on my partner. So I push myself into freelance work, up keeping everything to a high standard, never taking a break from videos or auditory outlets as I work, always distracting myself. But it is all a distraction, and I am wearing on them when they ask about what is wrong and I open up about my mental health or have anxiety attacks or mental breakdowns.""Why are you like this / Why do you have to be like this?""""I cannot stay in this relationship if you cannot get better.""""Why is something always wrong with you?""""cannot you do this later / Why do you have to do this right now?"" ""What the fuck do you expect me to do / What the fuck is wrong with you now?"" And so I keep it all down, I suppress it, and I feel physically awful all the time. Chronic migraines, I never get a break where my mind is not trying to distract itself or is not in an existential dread or downfall. it is not worth living like this, even as much as I love my pets and partner and family. I do not want to leave them but I feel I have to. I wish it was like the romanticized versions of mental health issues. Where your partner holds you and tells you it will be okay, instead of the reality of your partner getting stressed and cracking every now and then and yelling and making it worse and saying hurtful things that come back around the next time, no matter how hard you try to forget it. When I get like that, being held and told it is going to be okay sounds like something otherworldly and heavenly and amazing. I really want to end it all, especially knowing that I will never have that. I have had that maybe a few times, and only after being torn down, only after the person who has the misfortune of seeing me like that calms down. Even then, they never learn a better way to handle it, or listen to me or care to remember when I try to get out what I need and how to handle the situation (I say what my therapist has told me to tell others, it does not work) because I guess they all forget. it is a cycle of pain, relief at last, and then forget. Then repeat. Constantly. And I am too weak to handle it. there is good reason for me living. I know if I passed many would miss me greatly and my pets would likely be confused or miss me as well. I do not want that to happen, I suppose, but I want to end this constant suffering and that seems like a small price to pay. Though I also do love being sentient and conscious, I love listening and seeing and hearing new things. I love learning, and in this world and universe there is so much to learn, I could spend a lifetime doing so, even though I may not have access to formal higher education I have a phone and access to videos, lectures, news and studies. That might be worth sticking around for, but I only love it so much because it is a distraction from my deeper troubles. So why dwell in it and continue the distraction? Even when I write this stuff, it makes me cry hard because towards the end I realize how much I enjoy life and living, and I realize how hard and near incapable I am of doing so fully. It makes me feel shattered and bleak. Why even write it at all?It feels like I cannot even trust my own brain anymore. I already cannot trust it. Why even go on if I cannot trust my own brain? I just want to be happy like I was before. I feel defeated",Suicidal
11444,"I should say at the outset that I am a survivor of 20 years of suicidal ideation. Please do not accuse me of making light of this subject, I have a right to. (As I believe everyone does, if they do it with love, but that is another story.)My motivations are as follows:1. Expose the ridiculousness that is as inherent in suicide as it is in every action. 2. Replace upsetting brainworms (actual plans) with scenarios which scratch the itch but are also amusing or distracting, or are calming because they are obviously fantasy. I have seen this approach taken, without the above reasoning made explicit, in an old blog I came across once. The only one I can remember is from a standing start, drive your head full-speed at the pavement. It could have been considered a hateful site I guess, but I do not think it came from that place, and I found it hilarious and calming.Please share the most hilarious and fucked up suicide methods that have occurred to you. Ill start with one that recurs to me. I would not wish it on another who never thinks of suicide, but for anyone that does, I hope that it occurs to you in a bad moment, to bring you humour and remind you that you are not alone.So here is my funniest suicide method:Hanging via bungee cord in front of a train. The train hits, and any remains left attached to the stretched rope are comedically pinged back in the opposite direction, disappearing from view near the end of their arc.(I know that this would not work and I know that train drivers deserve better. Realism and empathy with hypothetical characters are not the point here, ok? If its that shit, write a better one and that can be my comedy suicide brainworm) Funny suicide methods?",Suicidal

11448,I met this guy on tinder and he seemed really nice and different than other men. It was too good to be true. He would tell me not to trust other guys because they will just use me. he would tell me he never lies and will always be here for me. Well of course those were just lies to get me to trust him and sleep with him. I always trust the wrong people. Later on after I slept with him he kicked me out in the middle of the night. I asked him why and first he said he was worried my mom would be upset I was out late. His second answer was that his boss was coming over and I had to leave. That made no sense so I knew something was up. He later admitted he has a wife of 3 years and he has blocked me. I feel used and worthless. I am already extremely depressed and I hate myself so much..what hurts most is that he dosen't care at all. I mentioned to him before that I was suicidal and he comepletely ignored it. All this just makes me realize how much of a useless piece of crap I am. For someone to just sleep with me and move on with ease let us me know I am not worth shit. I was so nice to him. I even tried to help his new business out by asking a bunch of people to leave 5 star google reviews for his store. what is even worse is that he planned to sleep with me then leave the state this whole time. He did not tell me he planned to leave until after he slept with me of course. I am worthless,Depression
11449,I met this guy on tinder and he seemed really nice and different than other men. It was too good to be true. He would tell me not to trust other guys because they will just use me. he would tell me he never lies and will always be here for me. Well of course those were just lies to get me to trust him and sleep with him. I always trust the wrong people. Later on after I slept with him he kicked me out in the middle of the night. I asked him why and first he said he was worried my mom would be upset I was out late. His second answer was that his boss was coming over and I had to leave. That made no sense so I knew something was up. He later admitted he has a wife of 3 years and he has blocked me. I feel used and worthless. I am already extremely depressed and I hate myself so much..what hurts most is that he dosen't care at all. I mentioned to him before that I was suicidal and he comepletely ignored it. All this just makes me realize how much of a useless piece of crap I am. For someone to just sleep with me and move on with ease let us me know I am not worth shit. I am worthless,Depression
11457,"Call me a psychopath but I have been fantasizing of killing my mom and maybe my little brother, calling the cops, and have them kill me. I know that sounds super deranged but that is an actual intrusive thought that invades my mind almost every single day. Everytime I go into the kitchen I see the big butcher knife and all I can think of is driving that thing straight into my mom's chest or sometimes into mine.I am really scared about what is happening. I really do not want to do that but the thought just keeps coming back to me. I am a 17F so my mind is still young, so could the thoughts be normal? I am a very quiet introvert with only 2 close online friends (I do not have irl friends), and have been bullied a lot.Also, my older brother passed away a few years ago and that really fucked me up. Could his death have triggered something in my brain? I do not want to tell my mom because I do not want to scare her and my severe social anxiety kind of prevents me from seeking help myself. I do not know if I am having suicidal thoughts",Suicidal
11464,"I honestly do not even know where to start. I do not want to dox myself or share my entire life story, so I will try to keep this concise and to the point.In the spring of 2020, I went to rehab. Afterwards, I moved out of state and spent 6 months in sober living. I had originally planned to spend a year and possibly start a whole new life in this new state, but as fate would have it, my dad's health kept getting worse and worse. Trying to be a good son, I moved back home to look after him. I will be forever grateful for being able to spend the last 2 weeks or so of his life with him. He died 2 days before Christmas. I stayed with my dad's brother for about a week, that was not working out. My uncle's oldest son, feeling bad for me, offered to let me stay with him and his wife on the condition that I stayed sober and found a job so that I could pay rent. I ended up staying with them for about 6 months, until I had had enough. One day, I overheard him talking with his brother on the phone bragging about how well I was doing and how hard I was working. here is what killed it for me - he then starts talking about how my parents did not make it easy for me (""they f*cked him up pretty good""), and then he went for the jugular - ""I loved uncle [redacted], God love him, but he was a f*ck up"".Like dude, it is not enough that I am working full time, I am paying you money to stay here, and when I am not busting my hump at my paying job I am cleaning your house, washing dishes, vacuuming, cleaning the yard, doing all the things that you are too lazy to do so you wait for your wife to deal with it. So really, I am doing all these things (FOR FREE) to make her life easier since you will not, and you thank me by disrespecting/insulting my dad who JUST DIED?! Oh hell no. To this day, I still have not confronted him. Instead, I have chosen to forgive him, but I will never forget how that made me feel.In the effort to save face and leave as gracefully as possible, I said thank you both for your hospitality, I will be forever grateful, it is time for me to be my own man and go my own way. That was the end of June. I have been homeless ever since.The little bit of money I have managed to save (not squander away), I have been slowly bleeding away living in hotels. My 2 weeks notice at my job will be up next Friday, after which I will be attending a trade program for 6 weeks. I am in my mid 30's, never finished 4 year college (although I have an Associate's degree), and these last few years I have really been racking my brain trying to figure out what to do with my life. I mean, I am currently working at an auto parts factory making under $12 an hour and have been working 13 hour days for a while now and have literally nothing to show for it. I am sick and tired of breaking myself down day in and day out, a prisoner of the time clock. it is time for me to find something that will pay way better than what I am doing now, something where I can make a good life for myself without breaking my back, something I can see me doing until I retire.I got paid today, and I get paid again on the 6th. Whatever I make between now and the 6th is going to have to last me til I graduate school about halfway through September. I have reached out to friends and family on FB to see if anyone can or is willing to help, hell I would even take a sublease at this point. So far, no luck. Even my own mom asked me if I knew anyone who was looking to rent out a room.About the only possible saving grace I can think of at this point would either be to reach out to my local housing authority and live in section 8 for a while, or to liquidate my stock portfolio and try live off that until I graduate school in September. I would really rather not have to go that route if I can help it because the stock in question is potentially poised to take the f*ck off soon and I would hate to miss out on a possible once in a lifetime opportunity. Normally, my dad would be my 1st consultation regarding such matters, but he is gone and about the only other person I have in this world that I can talk to without fear of judgement is his sister, my beloved aunt who in many ways is more of like a mother than my own flesh and blood.I feel lost, you all. I am broke, depressed, mourning, stressed, burnt out, tired, hurting and I have no idea what to do.TL; DR - I have been homeless since the beginning of this month after leaving my cousin's house because I refused to tolerate any further disrespect. Now, I am trying to make what little money I have last until after I graduate trade school in September. It can only get better from here, right?",Depression
11469,"I am just so tired, been for a while, but I tried at least.. Streaming especially helped me feel I was doing something with my life and having a schedule/stuff to do helped a lot as well.. But after the previous \~week with my friend who visited me I am just done really.. With everything.. Now that he has left I have been binge eating and drinking alcohol to get drunk on a daily basis as well.. Streaming is also gone now, and I doubt anyone cares either.. About streaming or me really.. I am just so weak, have so many issues, I am beaten down over and over and I just cannot handle it anymore. I also seem to have some ""PTSD"" now. Anything that feels like a touch including my own clothes at times, or even seeing guys touch girls makes me flinch or freeze up and feel terrible, and I fear guys even more now than before as well, even hearing guys breathe in a certain way now on dramas or movies I watch makes me feel quite unwell.. does not help I am ugly as usual. Got called sir at the store today even though my friends tell me I am pretty.. Right.. Also does not help people keep staring at me like crazy non-stop. My friend confirmed this, so I know it is not just me imagining things.. My age regression stuff does not help either.. Wish I got carded for my age, but I look probably 30s or 40s.. have not been carded since I was like 15.. lmao.. Myriad of other issues, but bringing them up with nurses, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists does not do anything, or they treat it as if it is a normal thing.. e.g. me mentioning dissociation and I just get applauded for the effort I have done so far based on my own research as usual, sigh.. (I tend to learn a lot on my own whenever I need to help someone, can help someone or face my own issues I need to resolve..) Had to solve a lot of medical issues this way as well, since the entire system here in Denmark has just failed me, or doctors are openly hostile to me because I am a foreigner.. Meds for me also never worked, I tried so many and they all ruined me completely. Only diet and lifestyle ever worked for me in any way, but can be hard to maintain when you fear going outside and when you spiral one day or friends/family make you eat stuff you never eat normally, and then spiral downwards starts.. (I get very easily addicted..)Already been thinking of various methods and where to go or get stuff, even thinking of a suicide note for the past several days.. As much as I want to say I will admit myself like last year (was forced there, though) I will not. It would be extremely traumatic to me (was quite difficult) and make things even worse afterwards.Wish the pain would stop, but it is been lifelong and there is no help because I have been pooped on by so many people growing up, and now I am just broken completely, and things just get more difficult as I get older as well, which does not help.. How long am I supposed to wait.. 50 years to maybe get a tiny bit of longer term happiness..?I keep hoping I can get blackout drunk (almost at least) and end it, but my tummy just refuses to drink that much and I get drunk only.. Wish I had someone who understood me, but they do not exist. They simply do not. Not someone with as many complex issues as me.. They might have a part here or there that they can relate to, but never even half or a majority of it.. Tired &amp; Ruining My Life Further",Suicidal
11476,"So, I might be in a very unique and different position than probably 100% of the world . Please read it all and you will get it. So about 5 years ago I hit rock bottom. I went literally from being in cloud 9 to severe depression, crazy anxiety, low self esteem( just like an on and off switch) I ditched my career as a musician because of insecurities. Somehow I was able to accomplish ALOT in these 5 years. worked hard to find ways to always stay close to music and got multiple jobs within the executive side of the music industry, But of course, always self conscious because I was not following my passion as a musician/ producer. I had a terrible experience in all those jobs, specially because I got fired from the last two. Something very special happened during my last job. I met my current girlfriend/ love of my life and also a super. Straight up a super star, she is a very respected successful artist. After I got fired from my last job, I had a feeling that little by little I was going to hit another depressive episode, which I did. I already overcame it but all the residues from the past 5 years are still there. - Unmotivated, tired, insecure, scared, uninspired. Almost broke . Etc. here is is something unique, because of the past 5 years + my relationship, I have gotten the confidence and knowledge that I know that I can make it as a creative in the music industry (facts) but like I said, all the residues from the hardships of these past years are hardcore engrained in my soul. I am back at making music but its costing me a lot to be consistent staying motivated and focused. Basically what I want is to train / practice / feel motivated / content / in order to prove myself that I got this and once again feel like I am in cloud 9. Anyone with some knowledge? I want to work hard again but this time for myself and not someone that is paying my bills , I want to keep my ambitions alive and conquer everything I have always wanted to , but this time accompanied by my girl .

11485,"Let me preface this by saying that this is mostly me venting and thinking that I am an attention seeker.I do not know how often it happens but its gotten to the point that I am writing this. I do not know if this is normal not but I am turning 20 in a couple of days and for the past 5-6 years have had on and off bouts of suicidal thoughts. Some worse than others where I seriously plan out and try and figure out the way to commit suicide in a way that would not end up making my parents sad. I do not want to give myself a self-diagnosis so I do not consider myself depressed, just really stupid.Pretty much every night I have existential thoughts about wishing I was never born or wishing my parents and friends hated me so they would not care if I killed myself. I hate writing stuff down or trying to explain myself because of two reasons. First is I think I am an attention seeker meaning I think that I am not actually depressed. I mean In all honesty I should not be. Nothing bad has ever happened to me so I should not be depressed I do not understand why. I hate talking about this because I hate people who self-diagnose and try and get attention and pity from others. The only reason I am posting this is because I am concerned about my mental health because I actually visited a nearby bridge at around 4 am, but gave up because I was scared of my parents being sad. This is my second time writing this.My second reason is my parents. I honestly wish they never had me. They care about me, and I am basically just spitting in their face by having these thoughts. I wish they hated me so I would not care about waiting to kill myself.I would like to know how to bring this up to people if I actually am suicidal. Currently I am hating myself to the extreme because I quit my first job after 3 years and have been leeching off my parents for the last month except for doing chores, and running errands for them. They even give me money for the errands and I do not even pay rent so I feel like a complete scumbag. I am interviewing for a job soon though.I pretty much dropped out of college because I could not even find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning, and that led me to being scared to go to classes because I am so behind.Recently I have not found any joy out my hobbies either I just feel empty doing them so I just decided to stop doing them altogether. My interests, and motivation to do anything has just skyrocketed downwards recently so that is fun.Sorry for the incoherent rambling, last question is is this normal to think this way, am I depressed, or am I an attention seeker. I would like to know how to bring this up to people if I am actually suicidal. Am I actually depressed?",Suicidal

11513,"I enjoy writing and being by myself. I have some projects lined up that should release in the next year or two. I do not expect to become rich, what I hope is that these projects will perform well enough to allow me to quit my job. If not, I think I will live off any remaining savings for a month or so, enjoying final moments, then death.In the United States, apparently none of us have the capability to produce thoughts. If you stand around in silence, people will be bothered by it. Have to always talk and smile. For my entire life, I have been talked to as if I am a complete idiot. To be smart, have to always talk and never think... Tired of being talked down to. Tired of living in such a grossly ignorant country. Tough to find fulfilling work. I like my mind and I like to think and feed my varied curiosity. Writing seems like the only joy to fulfill these desires. Though, I once tried a job that at least provided physical fulfillment: landscaping. Basically get paid to work out in the sun, be surrounded by nature. I applied landscaping maintenance but they ended up placing me on landscape construction, which is currently out of my capabilities due to such immense heavy lifting. Tried telling HR about this, ended spending an hour with two higher-ups telling me that I should not be disruptive. When I had went into the job interview, I told the higher-up that I am a little reluctant, 30 pounds is probably my lifting limit. He responds ""Oh you will just be planting flowers"". A 50 pound slab is quite the flower.Job that I currently do is not horrendous, but four or five constant 12 hour shifts is a bit of a drag. And while it is unintional, having my coworkers talk to me as if I am a complete idiot, just because I am quiet, not an existence I want to keep living. I have lived pretty well, and I have given, and will give a few more shots for a worthwhile life. does not seem to make sense to perform unfullfiling work.

I have never seen a future to myself since the age of 14before high school i was kind of a recluse doing my own thing, playing my own games on the computer and not very popular but since i discovered parties and alcohol I have been a main man that everyone invites. since then I have gotten along with everyone not depending on gender, the sarcastic humorist that everyone needs in their life, I have been a shoulder to cry on for males and females and I have always been someone that has given advice to them that they have benefitted from. since high school ended I have noticed that all my friends have gotten some type of lives and I have always been the one who has been included into new friend groups that have formed from those times that have quite not made it yet. but now is the time that these friends have ran out and I am starting to be the only one who cannot move on.I am from quite a dysfunctional family and i am now working a very severe manual labor job that i just do because i could not stay for more than a year in university due to never having learned the ability to study by being able to cruise through high school without any problemsi have no goals in life because everything feels pointless, although i realise that it is not pointless because my life and something that i do could matter to someone but i am really at a crossroads now by binge drinking at the weekends but does not seem a fast enough slow suicide. even thought of becoming an opioid addict because id have a point to wake up in the morning to get my next fix. sounds absolutely idiotic i know, but this is where I am at noweverytime i get together with my old friends I have acted like its all ok and bullshit my way out of it but I have started to drink more compared to them when i see them and its starting to damage the relationship i have with themits probably a shamble and it took a lot from me to write this since and not delete it like i tried to many times during this post.

11537,"The title is not meant to discourage others, but it is what I feel things have come to in my personal experience with life. I just want to get some stuff of my chest, even though it will not help for long. What better place to do it- than *Reddit*? I do not know, but I will still do it. I do not expect anyone to say the magic words that help, so this is again more for me to unload. However there is a possibility someone can help- so it does not hurt. I also rarely write large amounts of texts like this, so I am sorry for the confusion you might get from the out of order- randomness- etc.. from this text.This is also going to be really long, as I will include many things- both as background and as reason.If you struggle with things yourself, please do not take my text as a sign to be discouraged. I feel terrible when I see others struggle and I wish I could help them. **let us start with a little about me:**My first name is Adrian- the rest will remain anon. I am just about to turn 24 years old, live in Norway and have a stable full time job. I have an apartment, a car and money is not an issue.When most people hear that, they think I have life perfectly under control- that I am more lucky than others. And- to a degree that is true. I have been more lucky than many people in this world- but it is not what I have in my possession that brings me happiness. What brings me down is my social anxiety- combined with depression. I have a *somewhat different* type of social anxiety, but I was still diagnosed with it. I can be in crowds, be it in malls or shopping centers- stores- whatever it might be without an issue. Talking to strangers is not an issue, unless it is random chatting. By that I mean, if I am to pay for what I am buying and have do exchange a few words with the clerk in order to get something from the medical cabinet or something similar I have no issues at all. I think that is because I know what to say, how to respond and all that- it is all been done before enough times where I am comfortable doing it. When it comes to random chat however... it is tough to even do with my family. Primarily because I have nothing to talk about. When I am at work, and my colleagues are having a chat- I never join in because I have no clue how to participate. Even the colleague who is just 1 year older than me seems to have done a million more things and therefor have a lot more to talk about. While I sit there, trying to think of *something* interesting I can mention- but I am completely blank. When I do however get asked about something I do know, it is quite alright- until I make some sort of mistake (like stating a fact, that turned out to be false) I feel like an idiot. I do not show that though- I shrug it off and pretend I found it sort of funny. I live most of my life currently pretending I am happy, like everything is fine. I work at a place I cannot show my depression to others. I imagine most places would be like that however. I am quite good at that now, do not think most people know my life is... bad. **let us go back in time a bit:**Quite early in my life, after changing schools because of moving- I was starting to become a target from bullies. The good old classic. Some people would constantly pick on me, other people pretended to be disgusted when I was nearby- some just ignored me and so on. The school's solution to this was to remove me from class... I thought back then that was great, get me away from those people. I have however come to realize that it was probably a bad solution. I never got to work with other students, never really had a chance to socialize the little bit you can during class. I was alone, with a teacher of my own. I did have a few friends, so that was something- but long story short I messed that up and lost them.This went on until the end of 10th grade. Get bullied, picked on- and have a few nice people that I would stick with until something happened that made them go away. Then high school arrived- and I was excited for a new chance with new people. (and of course I liked the school.) The first few months, I attended school but gained no contacts. No one treated me bad so I did not really mind that.. Until one day where I entered my classroom, 2 girls were standing by the door and laughed when I passed them. Thinking back at it now, I think it was just a coincidence- but back then it dropped my self esteem right back to the ground. 1 of those girls I even found attractive, so that did not help. Then after a little more time things become quite good. I became friends with a few in class, and the rest still treated me quite alright. The only thing that made me feel bad was the thought I still had not had a girlfriend. (This was at the age of 16, quite early to sob about such a thing.). Year 2 of high school, I went the route for car mechanics. I was back at the start of having no contacts, friends or such. I was still treated alright by everyone though. I asked some people if I could join them when they drove to the store to get lunch (some were over 18)- and they said I would be able to join them- it one of the car seats were not taken by a spare wheel. I felt neutral about that, because at least they did not talk down on me or anything. Later that year I made friends again. Great right? Indeed it was, school was fun again. (Fun fact, one of the people in this group was the girl I earlier stated I found attractive.) The only relevant things from the rest of the year is about said girl. She was now a friend- and I did not want to ruin that. So despise people saying she was interested in me I took no chances. So I treated her as a friend, until near Christmas where I finally decided to somewhat casually ask her about going out and do something together. That was the day she just became the girlfriend of someone else in class. I was back at the bottom, but pretended to be happy. Back then I was terrible at pretending and people kept asking why I was down. did not feel it was worth talking about so I walked away. She, and the others though did remain my friends out that year. School year ended, and people from that group started to become somewhat snappy- passive aggressive. So I gave up on them too. I did however remain friends with said girls- boyfriend. Next year, I retake the same year but with another subject. Same procedure, sit alone most of the time at first- then I make 2 friends. We shared interest in gaming so we played online quite a bit. I believe these 2 were the best friends I had made. There is of course a girl in class I found attractive- and she had a difficult personality to understand... I misunderstood her all the time and kept thinking she despised me. That of course did make me feel horrible a lot during that year. At this time, I do believe my main because of depression was things like this. The year ends, and I have to find a job- but I fail. I think I got 1 singular interview during the summer. They did not want me there so I was without a job. Here is where I got lucky, a company calls me and asks me to come in for an interview. I get there, and see the ""attractive girl from last school year"" was also called in for an interview. At this point I do however realize I am not despised and we had neutral opinions of each other. (At least that is what I believe). Both of us get the job (as apprentices), so there is that. During the next 2 years nothing interesting happens, except me constantly feeling horrible about life- and not having a single good experience on apps like Tinder and so on. Before I continue, let us fill out a bit how dating apps have hurt me. By the time I had reached 18, my depression was quite strong. I did honestly feel like people hated me but were nice and hid it. While using the apps, I was often unmatched within the first 5 seconds of matching. That did hurt when it had happened for the 20th time. I never dared to say hi to anyone- so that is my fault I guess. Those who said hi to me first- made me feel good! For about 5 minutes until you could clearly tell in the messages they were uninterested. (Like the saying, talking to a wall.)These apps, did bring me even further down overall. Never up. Back to the real life part. &amp;#x200B;After 2 years you take sort of an exam, and after that you are no longer an apprentice. I scored maximum. (3 points, excellent.) So did the girl I was working with. One of the people I worked with suggested I invited the girl out for a ""celebratory"" dinner for finishing school 100% with a good score. It was worth a shot. She denied that immediately. (This did, once again- destroy me inside, but in the long run it was for the better.) Both of us get's the opportunity to continue working for a partner company as long as the interview goes well. That it did. We both remained colleagues so that is when I realized it was indeed good she said no. About at this time though, I make a incredibly stupid decision to ""reset my social life"". I thought if I could get myself into a completely new social environment I would maybe have a better life in general. I did this because I was still constantly feeling horrible- like people disliked me and such. After this I never made new friends, and 3- soon 4 years later here I am- still alone. I have never found another opportunity even to make new friends, I no longer meet new people. The people I meet at work are a lot older (no offence to them). And those my age still seem to look down on me. That is the big thing with me, I feel like everyone looks down on me- even without proof. The thing is, with social anxiety- is one notices so many details of how one reacts to your presence. Even to details that were never even there. I still am like this... Quite a bit of people have given me suggestions on how to deal with things- I have even tried talking to a psychologist. Nothing worked. When people say good things to be- it goes in one ear, and out the other. When people say rude things, it sticks like glue. I cannot take praises seriously anymore. I cannot take advices. I do not see the worth of anything. All in all, I ***really*** wish I never existed. I have done nothing good to this world. I have been destroyed- I no longer want help. I just want it to be over. The only things that make me feel good, even just for a moment- is random things like a stranger saying something nice. Compliments from people I know, do nothing. I honestly think, the only thing that would get me out of this she will- is a semi-random situation that for example results in me making a new acquaintance. But we all know that is not how the world works, especially for someone who is always at home when he is not at work. Summary: I do not think I can be helped anymore. My mind instantly switches anything positive to the negative. I was recently back at a neutral state, but then I had yet again a negative experience with another person- which brought right back down to the floor. I feel worthless- and all the other negative emotions one tend to feel during depression. This text became a complete mess, I know. There is even a ton of stories I wanted to fit in- but it will just clutter it all up at this point. The results of my depression was, a couple years back I made a deal with myself.I will give life a chance to redeem itself. I have set a date in the future- which I will not share- but it is still several years until. If I still live alone, with no friends- with no sense of purpose- with ***no light in the tunnel*** I am in... I will take my leave. It did in a way help to unload this, but not as much as I had hoped- because it did at the same time bring back couple bad memories of life.. I do not really plan on paying attention to the comments here, but knowing myself I will probably still do it. I would also like to finally point out, that (as mentioned partially in rule 5.) most replies with long explanations that in short just tells you that ""just to this and it all works out"" will not work. I am a very complicated work of machinery (not literally). For those who are just reading- thanks for your time, and if you are struggling with something I do truly hope you figure it out.. I know how it is... I just cannot figure out my issues. Not everyone can be helped",Depression
11543,"I have had anxiety, depression and mental illness much of my life. I have not been able to get proper treatment at my local mental health clinic. In some ways they have helped me immensely. I have been able to get my pure obsessional OCD under control so I no longer have such bad symptoms. It still definitely is there and sometimes flares up a bit, but it is just faded background noise for the most part. In other ways my mental health has significantly deteriorated. In the mid-2010s I completely lost the self confidence I had gained during my time in college when I found my tribe and got better in my art skills. I could not finish college and had to drop out due to my mental illness and ADHD and have been trying to get by as a freelance artist. I am mostly living on disability though and have not been able to earn anything close to a living wage. If I would attempted this without financial aid from the government, I would be living with my parents. And if my parents had not supported me, god knows where I would be. I would probably be homeless, which I know happened to a college friend of mine. His parents did not support his artistic pursuits and he had to quit school because they would kicked him out. My mental health is in very bad shape and has been for several years now. Since 2017 I have been completely incapacitated by the co-morbid disorders I have been dealing with. I have severe social anxiety, agoraphobia, body dysmorphic disorder, as well as ADHD and autism spectrum disorder. I also have C-PTSD. My parents have to drive me everywhere because driving terrifies me and I cannot even call a taxi because of my social anxiety and C-PTSD - which makes me terrified of being in a space with people I do not know where there is no quick exit - sitting with a taxi driver would mean I would be unable to escape easily if they turned out to be mean - I know it is highly unlikely but it still scares me. My friend had one experience with a mean taxi driver when she was in her late teens.So I had the crazy idea of trying out a drawing/art video blog, as it seems to be lucrative and you tubers earn a passive income, which I think would be great instead of just relying on government financial aid. I want to do it but I do not think I would be any good at it. It actually seems impossible for me because even though I have decent drawing skills, I have no people skills. I am socially handicapped by my mental disorders. One of the main reasons I draw is because I have such a hard time talking to people and drawing helps make me feel more comfortable around them. I have no idea how I would ever feel comfortable enough to talk on camera and not scare people away. I do not want to be insincere or fake and pretend to be more talkative and bubbly than I am. I have actually thought of doing a voice changer thing or just captions as talking just scares the hell out of me. I am scared of my voice or name being recognized by bullies and being stalked and harassed in real life or online. I may try one video and perhaps not even post it but just get a feel for it and if it does not work I will not bother. It is a multi-skilled vocation to be an art vlogger. You have to also have good people skills as well as video-making skills. I hate the idea of only video blogging with the hope of earning money but hating people. I like it when the youtuber is genuinely friendly and acknowledges their followers and all that. I would not want to put people off with my unfriendliness from social anxiety and not responding to comments or messages, or turning off comments. I just do not really know what to do with myself. I am not cut out for this existence. I feel powerless, I am a mess and do not know how to prevent my life from going to sh*t",Depression
11559,"I have had suicidal thoughts multiple times. Sometimes Id even get a little dramatic and put a pair of scissors to my chest and entertain the idea of pulling it in. That was cute back then. In the end, Id end up getting out of it. I am melancholic, and I am sure I do not bring much joy to those around me with this attitude.I did not really have much growing up. Physically abusive mom, emotionally abusive step-mom, long-lost half sister, and a Dad I can barely communicate with because we have a fucking language barrier. Not to mention that were not in the best financial situation.Because of all this, I want to aim high and at least be known and have my story told. I extremely envy those who are content with having a 9-5 because they had a happy and loving childhood. I wish I could be that laid back, but what for?I do not even want to die anymore. I am just tired. I do not want to end things by jumping off or pulling a trigger. I am just tired. I am tired of this bullshit ass life that I am supposedly gifted.

I do not know what is real and what is not anymore. I cannot even offer myself anything. I cannot trust myself and I cannot trust anyone else. This makes everyone suffer. If I am suffering and everyone else around me is suffering due to my mental illness than this must be selfish. I take and I cannot ever give back. Even when I think I am doing better, I am not. Even if I think I am okay I am just being selfish towards someone else. I am too much of a pussy to kill myself when it comes down to it. So my plan is to walk until I drop. That way, if I get scared and try to change my mind I will likely be too far from anything to do anything other than die. I want to be cremated. I do not want a funeral for me but if it helps the people I leave behind then I hope they can have one. I love my mom. I love my brother and my sister. I love my wife and her entire family. And I am just sorry. Sorry for everything and I hope that they will be able to forgive me for all of this some day so that they may be able to make their pain hurt less.

I wanted to move out at 18 too and have someone that wants to be my roommate but I just cannot make myself take up on that opportunity.When I was 16 I had plans and full intentions to kill myself by a certain date, but then my (now ex) partner asked me about 10 days before that. I never told them this but still I based my entire future around that relationship. And I still had suicidal ideation throughout the entire relationship, the only thing that changed was that now I had a tangible reason to not do it right away. I feel like at that point I accepted that I was going to die from suicide, it was just now I was playing the waiting game for the final straw. I know that I still have time and opportunities and I know that I am skilled enough so that if I could push myself do to make something out of myself, I probably could.

11574,"I got prescribed to months worth of Lexapro (and to take half a tablet a day) right before my insurance expired (they were trying to get me enough lexapro to last me until I find new insurance). That was two months ago and I have been afraid of taking it since.I smoke weed on the daily because it helps calm my nerves for like 30 minutes so I could work on my writing and get in the zone. However, in the past week I have been incredibly depressed and the upcoming death of my cat I fear will make that 10x worse (it already is).Is it worth taking Lexapro or do you think it will kill my creativity? I can be creative without weed, its just a small jumpstart. I am more scared of losing it to the lexapro but I am also scared of my lack of motivation, energy, and depression.

11581,"I no longer know what else to do but write this. I am not even sure what I expect to come of it except for hopefully support and sympathy and trying to see light at the end of this dark tunnel. I will preface this quickly with the fact that I am generally a very happy person, but I feel so defeated I do not know where else to turn. I have been with one woman the past 9 years of my life, and I am only 26. We have an immense story together over all that time, but I think like any person in my position, I thought we were going to last forever. We even share a kiddo together.When I learned she was pregnant, I really started to get my life together. We got married too around this time. I was working whatever jobs I possibly could, and I was always taking the next step forward to provide for my family. After about 2 years, and wanting more out of life, I overextended into a career I was not ready for. I made a few ""mistakes"" in their eyes and they politely asked me to leave. I was really devastated by this because it was a career I had put a lot of time and research into only for it to fall flat. Nevertheless, I pushed forward, and with constant strain from my wife's side of the family, I decided to move my family to my home state with the help of my side of the family. Things were no fairy tale, however. Our living situation was very bad, especially with a kiddo. Again, I started working, and only thanks to my best friend willing to let us stay in his home were we able to salvage the situation. For the first time in our relationship and marriage, my wife got a job with me while my mom watched our kiddo. We worked very hard together, and I cherish those memories a lot. I think due to all of the stress, we both decided to start smoking weed. I think she was 24, and I was 22 at the time. We were a very straight edge couple before then. Anyway, after about 3 months, we were back on our feet, but once we had our own place again and bills to pay, the financial strain started to hit again even with us both working. Mostly because of the long drive to get work and very little hours. I asked our boss for a raise and she said no, despite us working there for 6 months and always going above and beyond what was asked of us while others slacked, slept on the job, and had us covering their messes. We quit promptly, and afraid of losing our situation again, I uttered the words: ""If I have to work fast food, I will."" Well, I ate those words quickly. With no other job prospects in sight, I literally had to work at a fast food restaurant up the street despite all my prior work experience. I hated it at first. My wife and I played a lot of video games together, and in an attempt to better ourselves we started livestreaming. We had mild success together, but it was not enough to pay the bills. The thought of coming home to livestream after my horrid job was the only thing pushing me through. Once again with this job, I would actually run the entire restaurant with maybe just one other person while the managers would sit in the back. I did dishes, cleaned disgusting grease traps over and over, cooked all the food at the highest quality, and trained new members because people would quit left and right. I did this for about 6 months praying that our livestreaming would pay any sort of dividend. Despite the immense effort we had put into building a quality livestream and building a community, we just could not get it off the ground. I started heavily abusing marijuana because I felt so lost, and it made me feel good even when things were not good. I think with being the age I was, and the drug use, I started to experience a severe break in my mental health. Therapy resolved the issues almost entirely, but I did do pretty severe damage to my family as a whole while they carried me through that low point. No meds, no more weed, and I was back on track. Just to add a little more to that last section of the story too, I was really banking on being a popular enough streamer to get by in life. There was not anything else I wanted to do. However, smoking weed did open my mind to the thought of making music. When our streams would end unsuccessfully, I would get high, and stay awake another 4 hours or so into the night and write music even though I had never done such a thing my entire life. The music was pretty bad, but it was entertaining enough to keep me distracted while I tried to escape my struggles. I tried to become a manager at the restaurant, but somebody else always got promoted before me. Even people working there for 2 weeks were on the path to becoming a manager before I was. I did mention a lot that I was more interested in livestreaming or music panning out for me than I was working as a manager, but the thing was that I was literally doing the entire job anyway in hindsight. When I made an actual shot at it, I was told no. We had the worst skeleton crew you could ever imagine. Frustrated, I quit the restaurant, I quit livestreaming, I quit gaming, and actually caught a break getting a new sales job with an unlimited earning potential. I was still writing music as sort of a gag to show my friends and express my creativity. The sales job was a major blessing, but I sucked very bad at it. Every single person told me they were not interested in the product I was supposed to be selling. My sales manager actually commented about never seeing someone quite as bad as me at sales. It hurt me a lot, but I figured it just was not for me despite how much I loved the thrill of talking to people so directly and trying to get them excited about a product. I tried 2 sales jobs, and eventually found a chill job doing security work. I never forgot what I learned from my sales jobs. With all the time to think about my future at my new job, I finally decided to give my music career a real go. I would actually produce music on an old laptop in my car at the worksite. I had worked in almost every industry besides automotive and medical so I really did not know what else to try. This is where it all gets very interesting. My security job was reasonably getting my family by while I did this whole music thing. With the combination of all the things I had learned in the past, music was actually my greatest tool in the end. It helped me sell myself as a person to get the things I wanted. My music never spread the way I saw some others did. Millions of plays, thousands of plays, hell, I was lucky to even get 20 plays. It did not matter. I could show people my songs, socialize, and get everything I really wanted which was to be heard. I cannot express how much life was getting exponentially better day by day. I was so confident that my music was just one good ear away from either going viral or helping me to my next big opportunity. Naturally, with my charisma growing, my marriage getting stronger, and really selling myself as a true rockstar, I was ready to take things to the next level. My wife had discovered her bisexuality over the course of this time since starting to smoke weed. We talked about having experiences with other women, but as I am sure any person knows, it is difficult to swing getting lucky with one person, let alone two at the same time. I saw it as a good challenge, but never expected it to work. After a solid year at my security job, I had produced so much music. I loved every single song so much, and still I was not able to really turn a profit on anything. I did have one song reach 100,000 plays, but it hardly translated into any traction as far as followers or return listeners. To reiterate, I was more focused on how I could use music as a tool to gain the interest of another woman in my life rather than money. I met many different women, had wonderful experiences, but my wife and I really wanted to be with someone the way we were with each other. Long term, committed, etc. Before long, we actually had attracted someone. We talked for about a month, and made things official. We were all dating as a ""triad."" If you could not guess, as a man, living like this was heaven on Earth. I even found a job in this automotive parts factory making great money while I worked on my next huge musical project. Unfortunately, dating like this with all the new emotions really tore me up at times. I experienced a lot of jealousy while I provided on the job side of things while my girlfriend and wife stayed at home. My mental health broke down again for the first time in years, and out of paranoia, I broke up with my girlfriend. She was pissed at me, and did not take being broken up with lightly. I regretted my decision within days, and begged her to come back. She declined over and over. My wife and her kept seeing each other while I worked, and I mostly found it fair just because of the mistakes I had made. I was determined to show my girlfriend that I still loved her and make amends. I leveraged my factory work into an even better factory job making more money and with one of the most solid companies nationwide. I drastically improved myself as a person, and I even found a confidence being ""alone"" like never before. My wife actually missed the 3 of us being together just as much as I did, and then she convinced my ex-girlfriend to give me another chance. To celebrate, I took them on a vacation to a beautiful beach condominium. We all grew closer, and I even decided to try smoking weed again with my ladies after being sober for like 2 years. I had never been so high in my entire life, I was literally shaking and could barely even use the microwave to make myself food. It felt like the most earned vacation of a lifetime even in my own head. I had an extremely pleasant thought that was something like: ""Wow, I am really just a normal guy with nobody coming after me to hurt me being like this. I can just live my life and enjoy this heaven forever."" Our relationships peaked so hard here. I was actually in heaven, with only a little paranoia of my nontraditional dating habits coming back to bite me in some way. Great money, 2 beautiful women, my credit was building to buy a house, and a new album ready to be dropped on the horizons. With my relationships settled, the only thing I was really suffering in was the typical 9-5 work in a factory which had nothing to do with the career I actually wanted: music. With a sizable savings to give my music all the promotion, hard work, and love it really needed, I quit my factory job. I told my ladies, and they were very apprehensive. This is where things take a drastic turn for the worst. Little did I know, my chicks were still actually having some issues regarding the whole relationship. It came in a way I could have least expected. My wife, the person I had been through thick and thin with for 9 years, came out as being fully gay. It makes my stomach turn to even think about how they sat me on the bed to tell me that. I thought I had done something wrong to mess things up, or they were mad about the job, but no. It was something entirely out of my control. My girlfriend looked at me with sorrow because she knew it meant it was over for us too even though we had just fixed things. I wrote the song ""Mistakes Are Lessons"" as the final flex that despite not making a mainstream appearance, I was living the life that every dude on Earth could have dreamed of. The beat came first, but I did not finish the 2nd half of the lyrics until I had been broken up with which is why they are kind of somber sounding. I am now going through a divorce, I am unemployed, and despite searching for a job, I cannot find one. Even if I could, I am almost completely spent as a person. I had a short run going back to school thinking I wanted to be a doctor, but after studying biology, it really just hammered into me more that I need to pursue my passion of music. The only energy I have left to give this world is my music and my story. I am scared writing this because at the moment I have $24 in my bank account. I have never reached such a rock bottom in my life. The hardest, most depressing thought of my life is returning to the typical work grind where I have to hide my real personality. People always made me feel like I had to live and experience things to create great music, so that is what I went and did. I know there is still more experiences to be had, but I feel like I have learned lessons no man my age should know. I have gone from living in heaven to feeling like a slug. I do not know what else to do. Believe it or not, there is so many details I left out of this story I would love to tell, but it is already long enough as is. On a happy note, I ended up in a long distance relationship with an amazing friend that I actually had been telling my life story to for months on end. She did not care about my past, and she was actually the first person to ever describe my music as ""beautiful."" I really do try and make it that way sometimes, and she saw that. I have never loved someone as much as her. All I want out of life at this point is to tell my stories, listen to music, create music, perform music, and still be financially sound. that is really the whole baseline of this story too. I have been chasing financial freedom for years trying different things only to be taken advantage of time and time again. I just do not know if I can do it anymore. Being in this situation makes me feel like a failure as a Dad, a failure as a musician, and a failure as a person. Will I ever be enough? Financial Freedom",Depression

I have tried everything I can to resolve the issue and manage my own attitudes but I know deep down that until the issue that is contributing to my depression is resolved, I will not feel better.I have kind of hinted at my state of mind to several people and they did not seem to pick up on it, but then one guy did and said I need to get help. Is therapy really going to do anything when the underlying because is still there and I think I am already managing the things I do have control over (including my stress levels and the depression) as well as I possibly can? Are there situations where therapy will not help?",Depression
11590,"it is too long for me now. Everything just gets worse and worse. there is nothing in this world i know, but pain, sadness and tears. I just need someone that loves me how I am, someone that does not only criticizes me or says how bad I am and everytime I find a person like this I think I get friend zoned instantly, I mean that does not mean that is bad, but I want a person that lays beside me in my bed and that I can hold tightly and feel safe with. And why can I give so many people good advises, but I can help myselft even a little bit. I think I am just too broken for everything. A long time I could hide my sadness, but now it is hard to not break down in tears every single second I am awake and that is just annoying. And even my friends I can talk about everything, I do not think they want to hear me more crying about myself, so that is why I just stopped talking about my feelings lately. One example is, I met this girl only around 2 months ago and I think i could talk with her about everything that bothers me, but lately I feel like everytime I say to her that I am sad, she just gets annoyed by this and this really breaks my heart, because I really do not want to lose her, I already lost so many people in my life another one would break me completely. I really do not know what I am going to do the next years, I am so afraid that I am doing something really bad to me, because I do not want to disappoint my parents or my friends that I am so weak. I have never showed any of my weaknesses to anyone, but I do not wana do this anymore, I do not want to fake anything about me. I think life and everything around it, is just a cruel and depressing place. I hate it to be single, I just want to be loved, but I really do not think that anyone ever could really love me and this just fcks me up. There is no day in like 2 years now where I do not cry me to sleep. And on top of everything, in the last months everything around me changed and that to fast, I had to let go of long friends, I had to realize a close friend of mine is in deep depressions and so much more and I just cannot process all of it. I tried talking to that girl I mentioned before, but she acts completely different than at the first days I talked to her. She was like she did not tried to give a good advice or to comfort me, she just like said to me that I cannot change it and I should not bother about it, which is not really helpful. I mean I am not mad at her I am just confused and I am too shy to ask her why she is acting so different. I am just such a weak person, like I am not even trying anymore to be strong or sth because it does not matter, I can smile how long i want I public it does not will change anything ever. I do not want to kill myself, but at the same time I do not want to love anymore, I just want to not exist anymore and no one on this entire planet ever remembers me or even knows that I existed. Everytime this girl texts me, I can smile and even when it is only for a few seconds, in this few second I am truly happy and I do not think she knows that, but she probably does not like me the way I like her and that is the reason I do not want to confess my feelings to her, because I know this will just end up in she not texting me or not answering my messages and I think then I am done with everything. This might sounds stupid I know, but she is the first girl I met ever to just like me how I am and not to look a certain way and this feeling is just awesome, I felt like there was some hope for me. And I said to myself before I was texting so much with her, that I am not getting into a state like I am, but I just could not resist, I could not belive how perfect she is and that brought me to the point, where I maybe cannot live without her and that is even more terrifying, because I know on some day I will fuck everything up and Ill completely lose her. I could type so much more, but idk I think that was long enough. Oh btw I am 17 and I know this just could be phase, but like I said I cannot take this anymore and I do not know what to do now. If you are read this, till here i want to thank you. I love it to talk about my feelings and this place is probably the best for it.And yes that was all know thx and bye I think I am done with everything",Suicidal

No. because that is how much of a lazy piece of trash I am, I am willing to ruin my own life because it gives me more comfort and I am fine with it. I am a waste of oxygen, and life.

11607,I work in an urgent care and I got reprimanded. The first one was when I found a woman bleeding on the ground right outside the clinic and I went inside to get help because I could not lift her by myself. I told the PA and everyone pretty much rushed outside except me and one other person because I just got there and had to put my stuff down. But they think I completely ignored the patient and walked by them when I was the one who found her and got help. The reason I did not go with them was because someone had to keep seeing the patients. They were backed up already and there were 5 people already going outside to help her that it would have made no sense for me to go with them. They did not even try to clear things up with me. They just assumed that I did not want to help and told my supervisor which is bullshit. They think I am horrible because of a misunderstanding. And then I messed up by not putting the patient in the bed when putting an IV in. They fainted and started convulsing which could have hurt them badly if they hit their head. I know I screwed up big time and I just cannot get over it. I was going to go part time once school started in fall. But now I think I should just quit. Maybe I just do not belong in health care and its a mistake going to nursing school. that is all I know how to do and I cannot even do things right.

11618,"I fucking hate today, and I just lost it a couple minutes ago. First, I just avoided getting into an accident Becca some fucking asshole mother fucker in a Ford pickup decided that the speed limit did not apply to him, passed me, and caused a car traveling in the other direction to come colds to a complete stop, me to come to a complete stopped, and missed the oncoming car by less than ten feet. I did not even get a chance to catch his license plate number before he disappeared.

I spent most of my childhood alone or hanging out with the characters I created in my head. All of my sisters and family members are constantly talking about how I ""missed out."" Missed out on the fun things they used to do, missed out on having a dad who gave a shit about me, missed out on most people even giving half a shit. I have been so starved of human love and affection that I recently realized I was in love with one of my characters. How pathetic is that? I am like Lars and the Real Girl but even more cringe.

I was literally so bored and alone that I literally tried suicide because fuck it, why not? Sounded fun at the time. Now, I only enjoy things vicariously through others. Like a ghost. Life has become a spectator sport.

11636,"And has life gotten better?&amp;#x200B;No. Everything is worse.I had some depressive bouts leading up to 21 over how much I was missing out on things that would make me happy. I had never had a date, let alone a relationship, never drank or went to parties and had wild fun like the other people my age I was too meek and scared of everything and despite constant jobhunting, my age and inexperience only ever got me a part time job cleaning public toilets, which did not help as I already felt gross. I disliked myself quite a lot, as I was overweight, short, unhygienic, unattractive, and I acted goofy, childish, loud and overly sensitive. But I can say that I was a hopeful optimist. I still kind of liked myself; I believed I was a good person with a good mind, worthy of love and acknowledgement, and had dreams of working in my creative talents with my then-friends, falling in love, and generally never wanted much like a ton of money or any unique opportunities, just the average house and family life that everyone tends to get, which has always been my focus. And it seems easy enough for everyone else to get, right?I tried. I mean, I really did try, for a decade. I jobsearched like crazy for years while bouncing around my familys homes, doing unpaid work experience after unpaid work experience just to have enough skills to actually be employable, for something other than needing a friend of a parent to put a good word in for me to even qualify as a toilet cleaner. When my dad said he was moving away to live with his new family he invited me to come, but I was 25 and already felt like a leeching loser, so lived off beans and boiled potatoes just to afford a spare room in a house share enough to be out of his way. I got into being more healthy and lost 55lbs during that time, cleaned up my hygiene and nutrition. It stuck, and I now go months without eating any sugar, learnt to cook well, and exercise every day. I went back to university to meet new people, as all my friends had drifted off in life or abandoned me altogether, and I also still had not had a relationship, so thought it would be a great way to meet likeminded people; adult connections that stick around and are mutual, as opposed to the ones Id made in childhood that had drifted off around 21. It was draining, but I did manage to graduate. Trying to study, work, look after myself and meet people was hard to do all at once because I never really was good at growing up Id had a 4 year agoraphobic stint in my teens that had given me anxiety and really damaged my ability to socialise or develop like a normal person, I have been unable to relax in normal situations or properly approach mandatory experiences of growing up like other people do. I was trying really hard to push through it though. I really did try.And what did I get for trying?I managed to upgrade my part-time minimum wage toilet cleaning job to a part-time minimum wage retail job, and have been stuck there for 5 years. I cannot advance in it because my completely broken social skills and introversion makes me really awful at customer service. And because my degree was creative where employability is based off contacts, privilege and experience, I am still no more employable or liable for better work than I was before university, I just have more debt to pay back. I went to study film, which has always been something I have loved probably the only thing in life I have ever felt *in* love with. After college, which ended when I was 20, I felt a bit like the magic had gone, because I saw behind the curtain which took a bit of the magic away, but was still interested in a career in it. Now after university, at 29, I despise it. I have no interest in working in film. 90% of my hobbies were creative based, and I do not even have any creative ideas anymore. I carried this internal sense of imagination and a case of maladaptive daydreaming with me for so long in my life that it was a huge part of me, but now all creativity is drained and I do not know who to be without it. My head is so out of it, I can barely register and react to things that happen in the *real* world anymore, let alone create complex things in my head. Sometimes I react late to conversations *I am in the middle of.* My cognitive function has crashed and I do not even think I could handle a harder job than retail now. But film was a secondary reason to study, I went to uni to open up socially and actually feel like part of the human race again. And did I? No. I did not have a single date, a single relationship, I did not make a single close friendship or helpful connection, because I am awful and broken and not likeable, interesting or attractive enough for people to want to put effort in for or stick around with anyway. My social skills are actually worse, because my mental health problems and self-image are worse. The idea of love and relationships have always been a huge trigger for my anxiety, probably because I wanted it so much (having a family was basically my biggest life dream), but my self-esteem is so non-existent that my philosophy now is, if I like someone, they are already too good for me. And now its pretty much impossible because I have come to find people so insanely confusing and unrelatable and I have not found anyone that comes close to otherwise in over a decade. At least at 21, I kind of understood the generation I was around, but the world seems so scary and aggravating and confusing now, I do not know how I am supposed to relate to any of the younger people I am around who want to follow each others social media accounts or talk in memes, when I am older and just want to have real conversations. How the fuck do university students manage to get into so many relationships when they just seem to talk about weird shit they saw online and the sesh? I do not understand people anymore, and my odds of finding a new best friend or a relationship have plummeted to non-existent as a result. I have not been really timid and untrying throughout this time either. I genuinely got involved, put myself out there, engaged in conversations despite being a massive introvert, even arranged some days out, started drinking and went to a few parties, and tried my best to be human. But apparently people did not find the attempt good enough. No-one has ever shown an interest in wanting a connection with me. Th biggest change in life I got out of university was getting wasted for the first time, but that has now evolved into me just wanting to drink all the time, despite the fact that drinking only every makes me cry anymore, I still just want to do it every night. I do not because I had an alcoholic mum growing up, and I also still try to tell myself I want to focus on being healthy and nutritional. And especially mental health-wise, people say that stuff helps. But does it? No. that is bullshit. I do not eat anything that is not nutritionally beneficial, I get so many vitamins a day and only eat fresh meat and veg. And yet, I am still tired and sad all the time, and most of my joints and bones constantly crack and hurt. And do I feel better about myself after all the effort and worry I put into reading every food packet, forcing myself out of bed to work out, forcing down disgusting, flavourless meals because I am paranoid about the extra calories sauces and flavouring would add? No. I have developed a massive case of body dysmorphia, I find myself grotesque and I despise myself more than ever. I used to just dislike myself physically and behaviourly but now I do not even think I am human. I used to know I was overweight, but still likeable enough to not die alone. But damn, now I envy the people that get to cut me a wide berth. *I am* stuck with having to be around myself. If I were any of the people I am attracted to, *I* would not want me kissing me or making eye contact during conversation with me either.If getting 50,000 into student debt still cannot get me a relationship or friendship, if focusing and stressing so hard about what I eat and how I live still makes me even more utterly hateful of myself, if creativity was my passion and now my head is so disoriented and depressed that my ability to be creative has completely died for good, then I think I have tried enough. I cannot keep trying and failing. I am pretty sure I am done.I am not an 18 year-old who still has their best years ahead of them. I am 30. I have statistical, experience-based evidence that it does not get any better. I refuse to try for another 30 years and potentially get my first date or my first proper job at the age of 50. At that point, its just not worth it to me, and I know there are going to be some people who say it is who say life begins at 40 - but it is not. For most people, life begins at 16; from there, they make close friends, learn to drive, have wild sexual encounters and spontaneous travel adventures, find a home they feel comfortable in and have the strength and energy to make money to maintain it, and most importantly, they find love with someone who thinks they are worth something. I have done none of those things. But I *promise you,* I have tried.I am a logical person. I am a third of the way through my life, and its been a failure so far. Even if I tried for another third and succeeded, and then got to enjoy the fruits of that success with the last third, that is only a third of my lifespan worth living, and that is not enough of a percentage to make the extended struggle worth it to me. Its easier to just call it a failed attempt and go. I am honestly kind of glad that 30 is coming up and I made that promise to myself. It gives me a pointed reason to show this is not some spontaneous emotional reaction, but a legitimate planned attempt to try and improve things that has not worked out. I honestly have thought about offing myself early, but I guess my dad would like a photo of me at my delayed graduation (because of the restrictions), as he has a photo on his wall of all his kids and stepkids, but none of me, as I have not succeeded in anything. So I guess Ill wait for his benefit? (Before anyone says, I am not close to my dad, or any of my immediate family. Hanging around for their sake is not a legitimate reason. Blood is just a viscous liquid that transports oxygen, vitamins and nutrients around the body, it does not create convenient responsibilities to other peoples lives because that blood shares a similar coded structure). At this point, Id be glad to go. I have had suicidal points in the past but they were always emotional (and I always bear through them alone, having no-one I am close to or I feel really cares for or gets me). I always would not *want* to feel that way, get scared about it, not want to die because I wished my life would be different, and have a breakdown or deafen myself with distractions or something. But now I am genuinely, legitimately out of hope to the point where I am completely numb to it and I am not even upset anymore. Life is what it is. I have no emotion. What would I be sad about? The loving relationship Id miss out on? Its obviously not happening. And what a tragedy it would be to miss scraping by on living in a shithole month to month on an unliveable salary, eh? I guess I am only posting this because I am no longer myself at all - instead of being that bubbly and childish yet worrisome and cautious overly-emotional 21 year-old baby, I am now an untalkative, slow, ill-tempered borderline alcoholic who feels nothing. Id always felt it seemed selfish to pity myself when other people have it worse and I always cared way too much about what people think, but I do not care anymore, and I feel I have earned the right to be selfish and I deserve to have people know that if everyone other normal person can get recognised, respected, valued, wanted or loved to some degree, then I at least tried.I do not expect things to change over the next 6 months, instead of trying anymore I will just spend the time daydreaming about the better life inside my head and getting affairs in order. I am interested to see and hope that I have the bravery to go through with it in 6 months, but this really does feel like a turning moment where I have accepted it. I feel all that fear from when I was 21 has gone and I have the personal skills and the hopelessness to get out of this failed excuse of a lifetime.Sorry this was so long. And hopefully this does not just automatically confirm the idea that things *never* improve for anyone. If you are young and are thinking that, things may work out differently for you - it is a possibility. They just did not for me is all. When I was 21, I made a self-pact that if nothing in life was better by age 30, Id kill myself. I turn 30 in exactly 6 months.",Depression

I am 21, about to graduate college with very good grades, already have a decent job where everyone seems vey nice and helpful. I have very loving family, i have friends who i talk to almost every day but still even after everything i have i feel empty. I just do not want to exist anymore.it is not that I am sad but that I just can not imagine myself living. I have not tried anything yet but i do not trust myself. I try to keep myself as distracted as possible to stop thinking about it but the moment I am unoccupied I just start thinking about it. I even imagine what the people around me will be like after i die. I do not know when it started exactly but I have been feeling like this for years. In my first year of college i found myself staring down the stairwell ready to just let gravity do the work, then I had a accident in my 2nd year and the only thing i remember feeling during that was relief. I try to live by bargaining for time with my thoughts. I say to myself let us just try living for a week to watch the new episode of a show or let us just wait for that movie to release, or let us just wait until I have visited that place but it is not working anymore. I try thinking that my mom will be sad, my little brother would miss me or my dad will be hurt, but then i think they will get over it after a few years. I have to die someday let us just get it over with. I do not even know why I am like this. I have not told this to anyone. I tried talking to my mom last week but could not. I do not know what to do. I do not know how long i can stop myself. I do not even know why i want to do this. I have not felt happy in la long while, every time i feel happy the emptiness just comes back after a while. Every night i go to sleep dreading waking up in morning. Even now its almost 3 in the morning and i do not want to sleep even though I am tired. I do not know how much longer i can hold out like this. I do not know why I am writing this, i just want to stop. I want to be happy for once, without the permanent anxiety and fear. I want to wake up feeling happy, i do not want to be empty. I want to love someone, anyone. I want to be happy but i feel like i will never be.

11656,"I would not say I am often just super depressed or in agony, though lately I am pretty damn sad and hopeless. But mostly I am not constantly suffering horribly or anything. But. If life does not work out, if its more effort than what I get in return, I do not want to keep doing it. At my age, its unlikely to change substantially. And sure, it could. And I could expend a lot of emotional energy, time, effort, money, whatever, to try. But more often than not, when I have made myself keep doing that, it has either returned nothing, and I just lost time and money and happiness and confidence, or the bit of positive was not worth the effort. I stumbled onto something (someone actually) that was worth the effort. It was and is pretty new, but in just a few months we connected to the point it became genuine love. She wanted to see me, talk to me, be with me. And I felt the same way about her. And the rest of life felt lighter and more enjoyable because of it, like even those other things felt worth the effort. Something happened that changed her. It was mostly my fault, but I still have a hard time seeing it as something that should have completely changed how she feels about me. We still talk and have been seeing each other occasionally, but its not the same. She does not seem excited at all to see me, or talk to me. We only see each other when I ask to see her. Anything romantic, flirtatious or certainly sexual seems to have stopped. I am still in love with her. Its really hard to let go when I know she wanted me just as much before, and since I am still the same person she loved. And since it took this long in life to meet someone like that, it just is not likely to happen again. If I lose one of the very few things that was worth the effort, I do not know. I just do not want to keep doing this. I cannot leave though, because I have 2 kids I really care about, and they love me, a lot. But Ill just exist for them, just a she will, dead or dying inside but pretending I believe this is all worth it, for their sake. It does not have to be a solution, it can just be a choice.",Suicidal
11660,"I do not want to bore anyone with the details of how it came to this, but two friends of mine turned on me in a truly humiliating and nasty way using something I never actually did as an excuse (they said I fat shamed an actor's girlfriend- I did no such thing, I have struggled with EDs myself, I do not do that shit to other people) several years ago.This was traumatic and frightening, it just cane out of absolutely nowhere. They accused me of manipulating then by saying I felt suicidal, that I was fucking mean and horrible person. Just imagine being flayed alive while people scream insults at you and you get the idea.The only reason I never killed myself at that time was because my mum was recovering from some major surgery, so I moved back home for a bit. But none of this has ever truly gone away. They were able to keep track of my movements, which perplexed me because I blocked every account of theirs I was away of.Tl;Dr one of them had an account I discovered by accident. The one she proudly proclaims herself an MD. A doctor took part in this bullshit. 1I also found out I was not the only one the main/head bully had done this two. that is what motivated me to expose her and warn others......well, that plan failed worse then a second hand condom. Nobody wanted to know. They did not care. She was nice and polite to them, so I must be a liar. It really does feel like fucking high school. Everyone loved the main bully too...until she finally fucked up and they kicked the shit out of her. It just makes me feel I have had enough. The world is cruel, does not give a single shit about any of us. My dad is trying to persuade my mum to kick me out (even though he does not live with us ffs).

I got a degree and am working full time in education. I have a healthy relationship and I am doing alright for myself. I have been going to therapy for three years now and resolved many problems. I do not cut anymore and I do not drink myself into oblivion. Yet, I find myself here tonight. I got a message from him today. He does it occasionally. The other day it was a call to ask why I am so scarce these days. I tell him I am busy with work. When I see a message from him, I do not want to answer. I want anything else in the world but to answer him. I have this overwhelming urge to cut. To escape. Just for a second. Into that crevice in my skin. Into the pain. Away from the world. Into the silence of that moment. When I speak to my Mom and siblings it feels like my feelings are a burden to them. Their attitude resembles: ""Ugh, really? Not this again. Your sadness is an inconvenience to me, so please stop.""I guess I just wanted to share my feelings to someone who will understand and rather say: ""I am sorry that you feel that way, I am sorry that you are in pain.""

The air felt more airy, the grass looked greener and the birds chirping hit me as a beautiful song and not an annoying sound interrupting my thoughts.I did not stop the good habits but I woke up recently and everything was dull again the same scenery that brought tears to my eyes a few days before looked muted and weak. The fear and the anxiety I had been trying to knock out came back but this time stronger. Now this is normally where I quit fighting. I do not want to quit just those few days of seeing the world with refreshed eyes was a high I could not even describe I do not want to give up on that.

11675,"About two months ago I was out of state to visit my friend of 10 years (well say M) and i stayed for 2 weeks. During this time I was fighting with my boyfriend and she was instigating hard along with her mother which then put me in a place to break up with him. We got back together 20 minutes later knowing this is not something that can be done from another state like this, and M being disappointed in me says do not worry, when you break up when you get back you can come stay with us again. this did not sit right with me because she said When. So a week after my trip while I am home she stops responding to me for about a month, then out of nowhere sends a huge paragraph about how my boyfriend is breadcrumbing me and isolating me from my friends. She said this because when she texts me i take a couple hours to respond. M is however notorious for not responding for days weeks or months. Since over a month ago I have not had any connection with her other than the one message. I responded but she still has not. My friend of 4 years (b) I did not usually hang out much but since my relationship was becoming more steady and we were learning to take out time apart I started hanging out with her more often. She lives about 45 minutes from me but i did not mind since i enjoy the ride. Around a month ago my boyfriend had broken up with me and was very shitty about it, i was sure it was going to be the last time. So i went to Bs place for comfort and to calm down. She makes me promise not to get back with him, and her boyfriend who was also my friend gave me a whole lecture on why my boyfriend is a pos. Naturally I went back to my boyfriend (G) anyway. we have broken up plenty but only gave our belongings back twice or so. Our relationship is more dramatic than anything, we know that but to my friends its abusive. I have reason to believe M and B just wanted me to listen to them. To be in control of me. My boyfriend is nothing like how they portray him. However that is the reason they cut me off, was because i took him back. Most people have just given me the advice of hanging out with family instead but everyone knows the difference between a friend and sibling. I do not have a close relationship with them seeing as i do not do well with the brutal honesty and bluntness of their personalities. The conversation will always come down to why I am so full of excuses when they ask about my mental health. Recently I have been spiraling in my depression and i genuinely have nobody to go to other than my boyfriend but your partner cannot help everything. My social life is important to me and watching my boyfriend be harassed and loved by all of his friends makes me feel so pathetic. I decided to start going to the gym alone to help dilute the feelings but it just makes me lonelier that i have no one to talk to. I have always attracted people who take me for granted or want to control me because I am easy or impressionable.I also suffer from PCOS and I am supposed to be getting a diagnoses for bipolar. All of these things are putting me in a position of feeling like id be better off in a psych ward. Not for protection, but so that i will not be a burden on anyone or myself anymore.

11710,"I came onto this subreddit so long ago, and here I am again. I am about to be a second year undergraduate student, currently taking summer classes, and I am practically failing. In my fall and winter semesters, I did great, 3.93 GPA and was planning on focusing solely on my organic chemistry classes throughout the summer. But before summer classes began, I took a job working in a hospital, since I am hoping to apply to med school and be a doctor at the end of my undergrad. The job was a 3 day a week, 12 hour night shift, and it fucked with my grades so hard. My job began at the same exact time as I started Organic Chemistry 1, and needless to say, I did horrible. My first exam, I got a 40%, and it only got worse from there. The class is known to be hard and the grading scale is generous, but I did so bad, and barely had the time to learn any concepts. I got home from work so exhausted that I did not want to do any studying, just sleep. I decided to quit my job before Organic Chemistry 2 started, and while I am glad I am no longer at the job, a problem that I did not foresee is currently happening. I really did not learn that much in Organic Chemistry 1, and Organic Chemistry 2 THRIVES on info from that class. I feel so lost in the class right now, and we have an exam on monday. I have been studying the past 2 days and so far, I feel like I have not learned a fucking thing. there is so much that I should already be expected to know, but I do not because of how poorly I did in OChem 1. Like I am so angry at myself, and I am going to do even worse this time around. I feel so stupid, and its actually important that I do well in these science classes. I get so demotivated whenever I join the online lectures because I never feel like I am understanding a thing that they are saying. there is so many vocabularic terms that I have never heard of because I barely got through the OChem 1. I am so sad about this whole situation, and colleges are going to see how much I struggled. I have already been so sure that I am not going to get into med school, but this is just making it worse. I have been studying for 2 hours and it is just been pure confusion. I am so upset right now, and I am seriously considering s\*\*\*\*\*\*. I know you are going to think that this is a stupid reason to consider such an act, but in a household that prioritizes grades over everything, with 3 successful sisters who are making so much money as dentists, I feel like I will never amount to anything as close to them. And they expect me to be even better than them. I feel so stupid, so lazy, and so good for nothing. Scared",Suicidal
11712,"When ever I get this hypothetical question I cannot decide. Because 10 years ago; a younger me without depression existed. Some of my happiest memories took place, my friendships were deeper , and I had considerably less stress in my life. But I cannot help but wonder that if I go back to before I got severe depression would I be able to go back to that time and enjoy it; or would I still have my current depression( because I know what is coming). As much has Id love to go back in time and make better decisions; go to college early, be more honest with the people closest to me, take more pictures, have more fun, be a better person, and do considerably better in school, going back that far would change who I am now. I would have never met my current partner; never experienced the last year ( the same way). And if I had to go back and live through the happiest years of my life with severe depression, it would hurt me a lot. If you could go back to 10-20 years into the past with all the knowledge you had now : would you?",Depression
11715,"Met a girl and we both fell madly in love, the love we had I have never experienced before. Everything seemed so perfect. Then I caught her loaning her car out to her ex, then she rented a garage for him to store his stuff at our apartment complex. I finally put a stop to it all. We moved and tings were fine.!I would eventually ask her hand in marriage and she said yes. Covid happened and we got pregnant and ever since the arrival of our son she has completely pushed me away. She acknowledges it and we have talked about it a great length. She will not even let me parent because she is obsessed with our son. I love my family to death but I feel like what we once had is gone. There is nothing that I can seem to do to make her happy. I parent our son when she works, I clean the house make the bed and wipe down the counters I even vacuum and do laundry and once every other week I deep clean. I work 3rds she works 1st. I parent him all day sleep for about 3-4 hours work come home repeat. I write her personal heart felts letters, I write her poems and I do things spontaneously for her and it does not seem to matter. I have begged for us to get a sitter so we can go out and she refuses to leave our son with anyone. I have major depressive disorder with ocd and ptsd with hypersensitivity anxiety disorder. I am constantly triggered and for the most part all I do is cry. I thought she was the one and since our son came I feel I have been replaced. I have no family or friends but she does. I am drowning and I do not know how much longer I can hang on. The only thing that matters I feel has been taken away from me and that includes my son and his mom. I feel like I am a roommate and my heart is broken. I am not happy and I cannot live like this anymore. Major depressive order is wining the fight!",Depression

Since the beginning I started to have this episodes where I am completely overwhelmed and then I unable to do anything anymore, believe in anything or feel anything. First I hoped that this will just go away if we push through but it became worse and worse. I reached out for help, I am seeing a therapist, visited my doctor who gave me citalopram and I am taking 10mg since 4 days. So I am working on getting better but I started to ask myself: Am I really depressed or am I just procrastinating at an absurd level? I mean I am weeping daily because of our thesis and I just do not see me working on or even finishing it. I have better days but as soon as it gets harder I just crumble. Am I just so lazy that I put myself in this misery so I do not have to work? I will also talk to my therapist but she is in holidays now..

My mom is worried about me because she knows how I get when I get like this. I only have 4K in my account, which could last me a few months if I only dip into it to pay my bills. I am in such a deep rut, and I do not know how to get out of it. Like, if it was only anxiety and sadness I could push myself to get out of the room but I feel tired and fatigued, and when I get to work my brain fog gets 10x worse and I cannot interact with people properly.

I am currently working two jobs, one in my field which will not, unfortunately, turn into full time, and one in retail to fill out my free time and pay the bills. I make ends meet, put 10% into 401K and save some too. The problem is that I am being pushed to'find a better job.' One that is full time. The idea of the unknown and Change scares me to death. I know that there are jobs out there, but with COVID, any new job means I am the first one on the chopping block if things change or get worse. Then what?To make matters worse, my parents are constantly telling me about things that I 'should apply for.'. Not that they completely understand my credentials and what jobs match me. I just cannot get it to stop. Yes, I would like a single full time job, but the pushing is really getting to me. Any push back against my family results in them making me feel bad, like I am doing something wrong. they are good at that. Depression, anxiety and over helpful family",Depression
11726,"I have struggled with depression for almost 20 years. Now it feels different. It feels stronger, it feels darker. I can see my reflection in the mirror but I do not know who I am. Who was I before? Am I even any different? Sleep used to be my escape from myself but my dreams are vivid and awful now. The anxiety has crept into my unconscious. I am alone inside of myself. I have been taking lamictal for 15 years and recently I have gone without them for a few weeks due to unfortunate circumstances. I know I am experiencing withdrawal from them. My mind is foggy and distracted. I cannot concentrate on even a television show I enjoy. The things that used to soothe me are no longer working. Every day is the same as the last in my mind. I tried to quit smoking cigarettes...but I cannot seem to let go of them. My therapist has me confused and scared about what could be wrong with me mentally. I have broken up with a very close friend because they accused me of being selfish and toxic. Maybe I am. But I am just trying to survive. I do not want to die. I just want to be okay. I cannot work. My finances are being taken care of by my 60 year old mother who works overtime to support me through this. I am forever grateful for her sacrifice. The shame of not being able to support myself as an adult is weighing heavy on my self worth and esteem. I am in a very dark place and I am afraid. Sometimes I lay in bed and think about all the people in the world and how a lot of them feel lost or scared or just empty like me. How can I be on this planet with so many people and feel completely isolated. My friends love me. My family loves me. My boyfriend loves me. I know this. But it does not cure me. I am my own enemy. My mind is a prison and I silently scream internally every day. how is that for dramatic? I cannot find the words to express myself",Depression

If i really wanted to die right now i could just go to the river and jump off the bridge, but i guess my true preferred method would be to just shoot myself in the head.I have watched a lot of videos in the past of people killing theirselves and it mostly looks horribly painful. I cannot imagine the weight of my own gravity pulling me down only from the neck; were i to hang myself by jumping, eliminating the chance of pulling myself back up, chances are i would be decapitated if not unraveled from a mediocre try at tying the damn thing. And trains? Fuck that. Jesus.A gun though. If i could just get my hands on a loaded gun. I do not let myself. I still have to update my address on my drivers license, I have thought about going to a range but that would just be unfortunate for everyone else there.I live alone. So if i had a gun, even if its for protection, at some point i would probably do it. I would text my neighbor hey, I am really sorry, but i need you to call the police for me and tell them to come over. there is nothing you could have done, I am already dead. But thanks for always having been such a wonderful neighbor. Tell them the key is under the doormat.I have so many letters in mind to so many people. So many saying the same things. Sorry. Not your fault. Etc.But now I am going off on a tangent. I will not do it because i still have my family. My parents live nearby and my brothers away for college and i know how it would affect them.But i guess what i was hoping that someone could answer is which would be more lethal or at least because unconsciousness quicker: handgun shot through the temple or through the roof of mouth?Like i said, I am not going to do it. I know how it would affect those in my life. I do think about them. But i would just like to know.Sometimes it looks so quick, they drop instantly. But other times, you hear their groans even after.

11735,"I am very familiar with the feeling of emptiness. I was pretty much born into it. Though I wonder how many have felt the more niche sides of it.&amp;#x200B;Anyone who has felt it is almost certain to have felt a sort of loss of identity or a loss of self, a loss of drive, motivation, or dreams. It seems rather common to feel alienated or isolated. Sometimes willingly isolated to protect everyone else around you.&amp;#x200B;But it goes deeper than that, does not it. In my experience, it is like my brain and me are two seperate beings. Waging this eternal war against one another. it is like I was never truly the one behind the wheel, like someone else was steering my body.&amp;#x200B;And when someone comes to close, no matter how much I consciously know that they care, my mind always turns to wanting to cur that off. Because I will screw it up eventually. I always do.&amp;#x200B;Even going through therapy, that emptiness makes you keenly aware of the fact that inside that office is different from the outside world. Whether it be because they are being paid to do this or because the rules they play by do not seem to match up with reality, or because they truly believe that someone needs their help, specifically and on a personal level. &amp;#x200B;it is like the rest of the world exists outside myself. Like I have my own little cave where I am stuck with this monster inside me. I look outside and I see how beautiful life is for them. But it is something I could never do. Like I am not quite human.&amp;#x200B;There are a lot of lies the emptiness makes you believe. It all seems so real because there are facts behind it, like you know that person just does not like you at all. Or that your presence does not matter, like you cannot impact even your own basic surroundings. it is just an endless battle just to keep things tidy and inevitably it begins to become void of purpose. It can even happen with your body. it is so much to consider and do and keep track of so you just do the minimal amount possible to survive. &amp;#x200B;it is all of these things and the desire to want more from this existence. You know it hurts, you know it sucks, you know you are alone. You wish so badly you could change it, sometimes so badly that there only seems to be one way out. Anyone who has felt this knows what that only way out is.&amp;#x200B;it is the memories, the flashbacks, the damage inside. This sense that I will never be whole. Like I will never be human. It digs deep and makes everything a worst case scenario. Do they know I am empty inside? Surely they do because everyone seems to just avoid me. Like nobody sees me and those who do purposefully go out of their way to stay away from me because they can see how sick I am. it is like an aura, a neon sign that says ""I am a monster"". So people just tend to stay away.&amp;#x200B;And your brain is taking in all of this information and putting it all through these very specific filters and everything just becomes dull. No matter how aware you become of it, it does not feel like there is anything you can do to stop it. It just goes on it is own.&amp;#x200B;There are more personal aspects of it but this has been my experience with it. I guess I just felt like sharing because I saw that little survey floating around and maybe others have it stuck in their mind too. &amp;#x200B;But I will say, I have not given up hope.

A few of my closer friends know I am on anti depressants but that is about it. I would not appear depressed to the average person. I try and be super positive like I do rlly nice things for homeless people not just donate stuff like actually sit down and talk and make them feel human. I have a great heart I just idk. I am tired. Lots of people would say I am really pretty and self hatred aside I am above average for sure. The only reason I have not killed myself is because I am scared of pain and/or surviving and living a worse life than usual. I have big dreams and would love to live life I just would rather be dead to be honest. I work hard I have 2 jobs my own apartment and my grades in high school were good. I just cannot shake this feeling. I think I just felt so alone for so long and hated on myself in my head so fuckint hard for so long it permanently messed up my brain. I love but also hate myself.

He was my best friend/confidant would call him everyday if I was out of town for work. A week after he died I was fired. So I took my dog Suka, sold everything I could and went out on the road. Ended up in Oregon. While surrounded by natural beauty and people who genuinely wanted to know me I just could not as I was in another dimension emotionally. Asjed for help form my Godmother in Arkansas. That was a mistake. Was literally asked by her (a social worker btw) if I was a retarded.... So because I have fucked over my family so many times nobody believes that I want/working on to be better. Back on the road.Ended up in Tulsa. Worked at a call center. Call center helps me get a place. Pandemic happens. Stuck in apartment being yelled at by people on a constant basis. I quit my job. Lose apartment. Asked for help from a cousin. Cousin has a roommate with three other dogs. Said roommate is a veteran. During a family get together with cousin in law coming back from deployment, the dogs get in a fight. Veteran roommate tackles my dog (old Shepard Husky mix) and less than a month later I had to have him out down. So in the last two and half years I lost two of my best friends. I lost everything.

Here are my findings: general, bald men are considered less attractive than men with hair across the board is a pretty big deal it seems, and the only remedy that can make up for it is money, for a 56 man to be rated equally to a 6ft man, he must make on average $175k/yr more due to Eurocentric beauty standards, whites are generally rated as more attractive than blacks and other poc, and vice versa in addition, general attractiveness correlates with higher incomes, as better looking people typically can get jobs and such more easily than no attractive people as society has reinforced the notion that beauty=value=wealthSo basically if you are short, bald, nonwhite and poor like myself you seem to be screwed, the numbers and data do not lie.

11766,"Hi everyone, I wanted to write this to see whether or not people feel the same or whether or not I am going crazy. Basically, I am a 26 year old male and I am feeling bogged down by life and quite miserable. To give some background, I still live at home with parents, I have a fairly decent job, a girlfriend and a small group of close friends however over the past few years I have been struggling to feel content with life. I live in the uk and from a young age I have always craved adventure and living a exciting life. During my late teens and early 20s I have lived abroad, travelled the south east, been on multiple holidays but there is something I cannot quite put my finger on as to why I feel unhappy with life at the moment.Over the past few years transitioning from being a happy go lucky university student to then entering the real world has been a real struggle for me. The area I live has very little work opportunities and is known to be a less desirable part of the UK to live in. I feel that everyone does the same predictable routine of, working a job they hate Monday - Friday and then drink heavily on a weekend to numb the pain and then repeat (myself included). I really feel I am growing out of the uks drinking culture and want to completely change my lifestyle.I just feel that there has to be more to life than this. The majority of people I know are looking to get their first house/ engagement and to settle down but the thought of settling for this existence really scares me. I feel guilty for feeling this way, like I should be grateful that I have been dealt a fairly comfortable life. A week holiday once a year, an ok wage, food in the fridge and a caring family but I cannot help feeling that there has got to be more to life than this. I crave community, travel, adventure, good relationships, passion, excitement. But at the moment I feel dull and like the energy has been sucked out of me through joining the 9-5 rat race and falling into the trap that everyone does.I suppose the reason for writing this was to understand whether it is normal to feel like this?Is this just what growing up is all about? If anyone had any tips on how to change this mindset of these circumstances?Is it unrealistic to think life can be exciting all of the time?Thanks for reading and I would be grateful if anyone had any tips or pointers or even just to find if anyone is in the same boat!

11774,"To all of the people who feel like their health is declining , please do not google your symptoms. I have been dealing with ilness anxiety for years now and everytime I would get anxious that something is wrong with me I would google it. This lead to many sleepless nights because google told me I most likley have some serious health condition. Please if you feel like something is wrong just forget google is there and go to the doctor. The bullshit written on google can seriously worsen your mental health and lead to severe depression. that is what happend to me. I was already depressed but the last month was probably the worst time of my life and it all started over using google for symptoms. I had just read an article about different types of cancer and what symptoms to look out when I realised something was not right (kind of private so will not go in detail) . Long story short after searching google for hours I came to the conclusion that I am experiencing a common cancer symptom. So I instantly call my doctor but he was not available so I had to wait 2 weeks for him to be available and than some for the test results to come out. During this almost 1 month of waiting I completely destroyed my already weak mental. I was constantly imagining scenarios in my head where I get diagnosed with cancer or some other dangerous condition. I could not sleep or do anyting other than sit in my bed and worry. More symptoms kept appearing and my health kept worsening. I seriously considered suicide as my life was not that good already and being diagnosed with something horrible would have been the nail in the coffin. My results came back and it turned out that it was not anything serious, most of the symptoms I was experiencing were stress based and I had tortured myself for nothing. I am not saying that you should not care if something is wrong with you, but please do not jump to conclusions based on google articles. If you are anxious about your health , please please do not use google! (advice)",Depression
11777,"time for you guys to listen to my meaningless ramble. I am 18, and meant to be graduating high school in a year, except i will not be because my grades are too low and i do not care enough to actually try studying, which is strange considering my academics used to be the pride of my life. i failed at life this year. i do not know what happened. i see my life falling apart, i see myself binge eating multiple times a day, which must be great because i had anorexia a decade ago which still seems relevant to my parents and hopefully when high school ends ill off myself. i have no hopes or dreams. i can never get out of bed. i see everyone around me, breathing, laughing, eating. i have felt suffocated for a long time. my head is empty all of the time- i used to be able to think, to do stuff. now there is nothing to fill me. I am just a retard. i do not want any sympathy but i am. i do not know why but i always feel disgust when i see people doing anything. plus--i got a fake diagnosis of autism just because of my intense physical hatred of social situations. i got a fake diagnosis of depression because I have been burnt out a long time. also I am really slow. when will anythingg be real. i struggle to see the consequences of my actions. every day repeats- a cell. i hate life, but i carrrrry on. i fucking hate my crippled ass. i have never been out of my parents sight my entire life, yet they still treat me as a ticking time bomb. i can never be bothered to respond to my needs. what is the point of a point. I am done with this shit---but i realise that because today is the full moon which is erlevant to ny parents which means i can be dismissed. i hate myself goddammit. i suck at everything every day. there is just no point in my being. i profit off other people, and worst part is i cannot off myself or cut myself or slit my wrists properly,. someday it will be done. i just cannot be bothered and i have no correct equipment. everyone is more successful than me, and i do not need a pat on the back. thanksyall for wasting your time to read dis shit. master of pathetic idleness",Depression

My mom wants me to be this person i do not want to be and just looks sad or disappointed or just trying to hold her temper whenever she is interacting with me or whenever i avoid the conversation when she starts to insist what she wants again. I am living with my brother and his family but got to live with this atmosphere where they are itching to throw me out. I have been in a series of interviews for the past 2 months but cannot get in a goddam job. I do not eat and go out of my room that much to avoid whatever i am doing wrong in their eyes. I feel trapped. I was alone in the house earlier and i sat at the bathroom. the shower hose is made out of soft plastic, long enough. the height of the window is high enough. I sat there thinking how would i look, how long will it take till they find out? whose going to see me first? Can they tell that since i got here i have been suicidal? That they have been interacting with someone like me? That it would be too late when they finally piece it together? That when i finally went out for a hike, they did not see anything but a dangerous and reckless waste of time. No one even ask a picture or asked how was it. Fuck. And now i am spiraling to this feeling of nothingness, of emptiness and that thought that the only rational thing to do is just end it, because there is nothing really different in me being here, feeling nothing to being not here, feeling nothing. What i really want is actually simple, that someone would genuinely care. I am way deep in the rabbit hole that validation seems inappropriate anymore or any sign of response is pity or i tend to negate anything or mistrust anything because they will trap me. I just want to be left alone nowadays and i do not know what i am really here. This sounds like a rant, I am sorry to whoever got as far as here. The only thing that stopped me is the thought that i cannot let these people live in the guilt of thinking it is their fault even if it is all mine.

11786,"A bit of a long story, but please bear with me. I am a veteran and in 2001 in Afghanistan, I have got PTSD, Due to an incident that happened out there. Took me years to get better but I eventually did. When I left the services I became a nurse, and everything was going okay, and then we had this pandemic. During the midst of the pandemic due to stress/tiredness And anxiety at the way the world was going, I made a drug error. I did not kill anyone, or even hurt them, I just gave them the wrong drug. Id only been a nurse for 18 months last year. The stress of what I have done brought back my PTSD. Once I realised what Id done I reported it to my manager and she told me not to worry, and would support me. Fast forward four months, I have a disciplinary hearing and they fire me, dismissed from the trust I worked in for this one error. That was in September last year. A week after that my son (who lived with me and not his mum) it was discovered that he had abused his half sisters, who live with his mum when he was younger. So I could no longer have him at my house, as I have young daughters too. I went to the authorities about him, because his mum would not. My reasons for doing this was because I could see it coming out in the future when he was married with his own children and it would destroy his life, I think it was better off out now whilst still only young (hes 17). He said he was disgusted with himself and wish it had never happened. All this time later and I am still unemployed, as no one will hire me and I have seen my son once in a year.

I have tried to grow plants for years, even building wooden planters, but then once the plants sprout I leave them outside where they get destroyed by inevitable torrential rain. I just moved and have a dirt backyard that gets sun, so I hoed the dirt up and planted grass seed after reading how to do it, but even in this area I messed it up somehow. I also bought and planted some already grown peppers, but I know I will abandon them to being eaten by insects or just not ever eat what grows on them. The only things I have grown successfully are basil and hot peppers, but I just left them without eating them until I used them up. it is reflective of everything else I do in life, really. I just do not care enough to do anything I once was happy doing. I have cut off contact with all friends, completely fake my conversations, never play music, drink too much, do not exercise, and stopped taking medications and going to therapy a couple years ago since I realized I cannot even be honest with myself and was definitely not honest with my therapist.

11793,"Hi, people. Just wanted to vent a bit, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about 5 months ago, been taking Zoloft 50mg since then. Overall, Id say I can see the results of the medication, my mood has significantly improved, anxiety has slowed down. The thing truly fucks me up right now are the random insane moments, which are triggered by trivial stuff; I get extremely upset, not only with myself, but also with my partner, who is the most supportive and important person in my life. When I have an episode, usually it starts from him irritating me, or doing something that really hurt me, but later on whilst sobering up from the insanity, I cannot remember why I felt hurt in the first place. I cannot even think about those reasons while arguing or accusing him of something.I hate that after such a long time I am still incapable of recognizing my paranoid and insane behavior. All of the feelings, my anger, pain, paranoia, fear, they all seem real and reasonable. I know my partner and he knows me better than anyone, that is why after everything I feel like a piece of shit, remembering all the disgusting thoughts I had about him.I hate that I can notice a pattern of a really toxic behavior from my side, that happens leas than it used to, but is still here.

Everything about life now is exhausting. Social media has ruined everyone is brainnobody is authentic and everyone does everything for scraps of attention on the internet.

11801,"Sorry but this will probably be rambling. I am having a harder and harder time finding a reason to do anything anymore. I have a great job but I cannot focus. Moved into a nice new home, but cannot even unbox the first thing. Going through a rough divorce, but I always said she was my light, and now without her I cannot see a reason to do anything. Nothing seems worth it anymore. Being in her presence made me a better person, made me feel I could do anything. Now I struggle to make it to the bedroom door every morning. For the last few months I have leaned heavily on my support group, but I can feel them stepping away as I overburdened them time and again. I am afraid to tell my therapist and I do not know why. Maybe I am afraid they will lock me up. All I know is I spent 27 years lost in the world before I met her, and then 7 years feeling like I had found heaven. Now I wish I could feel nothing. That would be an upgrade. I am just empty. So empty. I do not see how I can do this without her in my life. I thought moving out of our shared house would make things better. But it is 1000 times worse. I cannot keep feeling like this, but I do not see a way out. I need her. So badly. She was my everything. I even loved her flaws. Probably loved them most of all as that is what made her human. I do not know what to do. I just know I need her. I have to find a way to move on without her.

11809,"Cw abuse and suicide attemptI guess I just need somewhere to vent. I have struggled with suicidal ideation since I was about eleven and because I never attempted, my parents never cared, no matter how intense they got. So I gave up on it and just kept it to myself.I got some help later in life and was diagnosed with PTSD from peer and familial abuse and BPD. I also struggle a lot with my parents trying to throw me to the rocks with coping with my autism. Every therapist and help I have been provided always was the mind set that I was not suicidal enough. it is hard for me to keep my mind from splitting, so often when it went this route I just dropped that provider. I am not paying you to pretend you care, you know?Then, it happened.The stress of my failing writing career, failing marriage, and relationships imploded last night and I just OD'd. it is a blur, but I did not really have a suicide note or plan. I was in the hospital since I was found out pretty fast. Unfortunately, since it turned out to be non fatal medication, the hospital visit was not very helpful and now I feel like a complete dumbass. I really should have done more research and gotten something fatal. It was just what I had on time.What I am surprised about is my indifference about surviving. For a bit I did fade in and out, but I was fully aware that on the off chance I did actually die, I did not care. The doctors kept trying to figure out why I did not and still do not feel guilt. I am not upset I survived. I just do not fucking care. I refused to be put in a pysch ward. I have sensory overload issues and I have heard enough shit what they do to autistic people in my state.Maybe because I am in a vicious cycle of barely hanging on, I knew it was time. I do not remember everything and I do not want advice. I also do not want fake positivity of the ""oh it will get better type.""I got enough from professionals. I really do not need to hear or be guilt tripped into why I was wrong for finally being provoked into it. Therapy is in the talks but I need to find a good fit for someone who is okay with who I am. Because there is not a lot of people that like me very much (understandably honestly). I am often treated poorly by others. I do not understand healthy relationships and now due to financial reasons I can only hope therapy does not drag my fiances into the ground because I have to go if I want to make the attempt to be better.

11812,"Hello! it is a rather long story, basically my whole life and how my parents' behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really, really sad.I am 20yo at the moment, female, but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 13. I am not diagnosed with depression, have not been able to go the psychotherapy, because my parents think I am joking and it is over exaggerated. Back in 2014, when I was hitting puberty, I had an awful summer where I realized everything is meaningless and whatever I do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my ""nihilistic"" phase, crying all day that I am useless, I have no friends, no one to understand me, nothing. It was rather unusual, because my mom has given me love all my life, my father was a bit on the cold side, as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me. All in all, my 2014 summer was pretty sad, I told my mom about it and that I wanted to see a psychiatrist, because I did not feel too well, but she brushed it off with: ""If you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30"" - its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health. During the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase, decided that even though everything is meaningless, you can still enjoy the good things in life. I still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself, end it all, being unbothrred with everything, crying over boys, broken hearted and many more occasions. Overall, I still had that ""it is whatever if I live or die today"" and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love, when it was raining, when my parents put me down for not being the first in maths/physics competitions, had different POV from their, wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could, enjoy life, they are basically super strict and did not allow me lots of things, even when i begged. I was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21, no joke here.Ff to 2020, I finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy, even keep it in a secret, and love him and enjoy life. I am also studying abroad in the Netherlands, first year student so we keep it long distance. it is 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf, i am crying all the time, i am also struggling with uni and just cannot stand it anymore, to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country. My parents are happy, I am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni. They are pretty chill, because I have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better. Ff May 2021, my parents become super toxic, telling me how i should study, spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that, to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago. They become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel, that i have a bf and all the things i cannot do. I do so, and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back, sit down and talk with them. I do so, we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation, they ""let me see"" my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind - that i shall keep studying. I have no problem with that and ff 2 months, they are back on their old shit, telling me that if i do not pass my exams i can never see him, that I am not trying as hard as i can, that ill end up as a 7/11 worker, that all I am interested in now is only sex and much more things I will not write down. I scream out loud during one fight that I am fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking, they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what is going on in my mind.Today i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it, when neither me nor her was talking she just commented ""or you are going to tell us that you are going to kill yourself again"" - like it was a fucking joke and i do not feel that way. I am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself, i cannot stand this anymore, its been every 2/3 days, its like they just cannot understand me and just want to obey everything they say. i do not even know if it is just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems, I am just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated.

I have pretty much completely isolated myself from my friends and family since i feel like such a loser. all i can think about is how disappointed they are in me and how much more functional and successful they are. socializing has also just become highly draining in generali never know what to say since i do not do shit and have no real goals. the only person i want to see/communicate with is my ex but he lives three hrs away from me and left me due to my illness anyway. we still talk everyday but knowing hes probably happier without me and will find someone else only makes me want to end it all. i seriously have nothing to live for. thanks for reading i just needed to vent publicly a little bit mental illness ruined my life",Depression

At the time I was developing it there did not exist many studies or much information about it especially not in males. It created a horrible relationship with my parents as they were desperate for me to just get over it, but I did not have the mental capacity to understand why because I was 3. It only gets worse as you get older because you dig yourself further and further into your comfort zone. My parents tried all they could to get me over it including hospitalizing me at 15. At the time I was also starting to work out excessively and starve myself because I was being bullied a lot and was disgusted by my physical appearance. The hospital did not know what to do with me either because they had never had a male come though and they mostly just specialized in anorexia. Long story short they eventually just kind of gave up on me and sent me home and I think that damaged my parents view of me for a long time. At the same time I have wanted to pursue a career in film/entertainment/content creation but my parents moved to the most rural and middle of nowhere kind of town in america so there was not a lot of opportunity or schooling for it available. I feel constantly insecure about the fact that I really have not developed much as an artist in any particular medium but I never had anybody to collaborate or learn from/with. People I went to high school with already have big apartments in LA and I have nothing to show for myself. I know it is not healthy to compare yourself to others and we should go at our own pace but I really do just feel behind developmentally. I moved out of my parents house the day I turned 19 because I had reached a low with living in Arkansas and dealing with my parents. I threw everything essential in my car and drove to the city I had gone to high school in and where my sister lived. It was 600 miles away. I was fortunate enough to get a decent paying job and an apartment that I split with roommates pretty quickly. This was one week before the country went into total lockdown. The goal was not to move out and wind up on a film set but more so to just grow as an adult and get a feel for living on my own. I made a bit of progress with my Arfid and tried a good number of new foods for me. At age 19 I tried scrambled eggs for the first time in my life. Pathetic yes. A big step for me. Also yes. Life in the apartment quickly began to decline. One of our roommates began to gradually let more and more people sleep on the couch and they were leaving the place in a state of absolute filth. I cleaned up for a while but eventually it became too much and I was fed up with it. Around this time I was thinking more and more of moving to a big city with opportunity and a scene for either film and tv stuff or live streaming. My girlfriend is a production assistant for a Netflix original right now in Atlanta. She has been pressuring me more and more to move to Atlanta and it seems like the proper thing to do but I have my reservations because I am horrible about driving it makes me want to throw up and their public transport is not dependable and the cost of living compared to their minimum wage is pretty bad. Her parents pay her bills. Her parents knew someone to get her that job. If I go there I am likely to just be stuck at another retail grind and I am not even sure if I could afford my own place on their wages. I do not have any higher education. I started college when I moved out but it had to be online because of the pandemic. here is where things get really stupid on my part. I cheated. We were at a low point in our relationship and had not seen each other in months or even been able to communicate much because of her job schedule and mine. A coworker came to me during my last week and told me she had feelings for me and we kissed. I feel absolutely abysmal about it. Yes my life was at an absolute low I was basically just working at this retail store and then coming home to a house that looked like an episode of hoarders buried alive and smoking weed and going to bed, but I do not want to excuse it. I feel like absolute shit. At this time I am back at my parents place with a fat savings account (good job me) and my girlfriend is still being very pushy for me to move to Atlanta immediately. I will probably break things off with her tonight. I am just so tired of all the pain and letting people in my life down. I think people have been as patient as they can be with me and as supportive as I probably deserve and I just keep fucking it up. I just want to have a roof over my head, the ability to support myself and the time to pursue my passions/hobbies seriously but its all so complicated now. I am so tired of letting everyone down. I am so tired of letting everyone down.",Depression
11829,"Tomorrow I am going home, having visited my dad for the first time in about a year and probably for the last time ever. I have a plan. I have the equipment. I have the date, even the time. I do not know what more can or will stop me. My friends (more like acquaintances) know my mental health is not optimal, same with my family life (family is not abusive or anything, just dysfunctional) but no one knows that I have thought about this daily for the last few months. I have one last therapy session before it goes down, but it is for unrelated issues, and I seriously doubt I am going to tell them anything at all. I get these tiny little moments of doubt, like right now, when I am not sure of my choice, but they pass way too soon. My only other mindset is completely decided on it. Everything is just cold and meaningless and I am over here, supposed to do stuff and plan stuff and be a good person when all I really want to do is disappear. There is not one fucking day I wake up that I wish I had not. I drift off in the middle of conversations, fantasizing about ending it. I am snappy and a total nightmare to be around. I am starting to lose my grip on reality and it is fucking hard to deal with this bullshit. Stuff is bad, and it is only going to get worse. I do not want to be here when that happens. I did not ask for this, I did not want this, I do not want this. Fuck. I do not know what I want, and I know that whatever it is, I would never be able to achieve it. I do not know what I am trying to do here. I am sorry. I hope my grandma will not be too sad. I do not think I can do this anymore",Suicidal
11831,"Sorry this is long but I doubt anyone will even read this but I just need to get this off my chest. \---I have always struggled with depression since I was a young child. On and off numerous medications throughout the years, nothing worked because, at the end of the day, I did not have things in life that brought me joy as others did. I was an awkward introvert with anxiety and depression. I fought through depression for years and really busted my but to get a good job and work up and create goals for myself to really not let depression get me. I have a great job. I am so grateful for what I have and yet.... Life. Just. Feels. Pointless. I feel like i am drifting with no direction and I cannot seem to pull myself out of this pit. Everything this I do just does not make this feeling go away. Therapy and acknowledging why I have attachment issues and things from my past doest change the feelings. I understand my past, I understand my issues, but knowing this or talking about it does not change my obsessive thoughts and deep depression. Medications never stopped my thoughts, sleeping pills barely helped my sleep. On top of my already struggling chemical depression, I feel my life has just gone down the drain of everything I worked for. Ill skip the childhood and long list of life trauma and jump to the past year topresent. Since I worked hard to overcome those....My fiance and I broke up because I walked away from a toxic situation to try to better my life. He was bipolar. Anxiety medication made me gain 40lbs (I was underweight before so this was not making me obese but it still did not feel good and cannot' seem to shake it)I have lost 6 family members in the past 3 years including my sister. My fiance told me not to bother him with my grieving because it was annoying. So i learned to just deal on my own. When I was trying to move on from my ex, my male friend tried to rape me at a party. When I tried to talk to anyone about it everyone just told me to get over it so i did and kept on moving forward. I moved my job and gave up the home I owned to be with my ex, who changed his mind. Learned to appreciate it and enjoyed the ride. I am living in a temporary apartment trying to decide where to live with no furniture bc why bother if i do not stay. Lived trying to appreciate how nice it is in a new place. I had a pay cut at work due to the pandemic forcing me to live in a cheaper place far away and now have to travel 1.5 hours to the office each way. But that is okay, more time for audio books. I did not let any of those things get me down. I tried to just find happiness in everyday things and get through. I knew walking away from a bad relationship would be hard, but that it would lead me to a better life. Things started to look up, I got a raise, I started working out daily, was really putting in the effort to say yes to things instead of no, spent a lot of time outdoors, read as many books as I could. Joined a few dating sites to keep my options open to love. A year after my break up and moving out we had a long weekend at work for the 4th. I got depressed, no friends were around, i felt so lonely and pathetic. Went running, to the pool, I got myself some nice craft beers and just started reading, watching funny movies and just tried to pull myself out of this. Even treated myself to sushi to try to cheer me up and just enjoy my time with myself. But by the final day of a long weekend alone, after many many months alone. I just broke down and cried. Ended up drinking a bit and just let it out. Felt my depression. BUT then. Random burst inside of my overwhelmed me and i said to myself...I will NOT give up. I am awesome and great and I know someone will see that. I am fun to be with, loveable, funny, I have a great career, finances growing, i got this, made a visionboard. So after 1 year of dating sites, I have talked to hundreds and hundreds of guys. I feel like I can tell pretty quickly when I click or do not, and really have not experienced any conversation of interest. I still knew id find someone but was picky for a conncetion. People told me it was because i was not open or wanted my ex, but I really was open, I just could not find the chemistry I was looking for in a partner. I really try to add to the convo and ask questions and elaborate to build connections, I am really good one on one building connections. But then... an incoming message from someone new. just another guy that took the time to write something out but the responses had so much personality to them. I started getting excited to see them come in. We moved to another chat app and starting messaging from sun up to sun down every day for a few days, then he asked me out. He was busy but wanted to make it for the following weekend. We continued to chat all day every day completely connecting on so many levels. He really confirmed he was interested in me and was so excited to meet me and was clear i was what he was looking for and everything we chatted about was deep and connected and understanding and always followed up that we were still interested. Nothing really changed and then in the second week of chatting, pics, and videos. We were writing back and forth, he usually initiated and we both continued the convo. nothing happened or was said but it one second after i respond I was left with ""unread"". Never heard from him again and it is been about a week and he never even opened the message. I sent another one a few days ago just expressing I wish him the best and enjoyed chatting and such but thought we connected and were still interested. That was never opened as well. I had not been blocked thought, maybe that was something as my mind obsessively overthinks it. Anyways, skip to a week later. I got too attached to someone I never met. I was walking on air excited to chat with someone I was so into. We talked too much it honestly felt implied we would clearly be dating after meeting and that was just a formality. I get it, I was stupid to care before the meeting. But I could not help it. I was still chatting with others to not put eggs in a basket but no one had my attention as he did. It felt easy and effortless. I took a break from online dating to recoup and ground myself. Obsessive thoughts consumed me. What happened? what did I do? He was so reassuring and thoughtful. I could not sleep for a week. I could not control my thoughts of failure after a year of trying after my fiance and i broke up. I stared at my computer all week watching emails and emails come in with no desire to respond. Depression has taken over. I decided to take to reddit just to let my feelings out. I am finding work so pointless. Making money for what? To be alone? I had a few friends, they were depressed too getting out of bad situations as well and trying to find love. All of a sudden LAST NIGHT. I HIT THE WORST LOW continuing into today. My friends have all left, two found new fresh love and are on the moon with joy after barely anytime being single (inspired by how happy they saw me talking to that guy) and they took to themselves and found people quickly and enjoying their start and really do not want to deal with depressed me. I was the one being so optimistic to them, telling them they got this and really trying to radiate positive energy. I am happy for them I wanted to see this as the universe showing love around me as if it was close for me too....but the universe slammed me with the same day, another death. Another male friend cut me out because I told him that i did not see a romantic future with him and he kept trying to manipulate me to want the same things. It got ugly. My ex reached out saying he wished he could have loved me but just does not and does not know why he cannot care about me but wished he could. I got so low, made a call to everyone on my phone list that I talk to, and no one was around. I went for run. Talked to a shrink who told me just to meetup with someone and get out. (that is always the advice) No one was around. Walked for 4 hours straight. Called a psychic just to give me some hope, something. Just ended up making me feel worse. I am now sitting on my computer writing on reddit drinking whiskey out of the bottle realizing that I am defeated. I think my depression has won. I tried to overcome all these situations, better myself. \*\*\*Now I am realizing i feel more depressed a year out of my toxic relationship than I ever felt in it. Wishing i had it back because this feels worse. I cannot get myself to work. I am distracted in my mind all day every day. I cannot make myself leave my bed. I feel left behind. Like everyone is moving along and no matter how hard I try. I keep getting kicked. I stare at the ceiling for hours on end. Everything I tried to do to stay positive came collapsing. Donated some money to some charities. Tried to volunteer but I get anxious in groups. Bought some nice things incase I got a date, to make me feel good. Did a juice cleanse to boost my health. Increased my exercise. I was going to my apartment pool, gym, anything to get myself out and about. At this point now. I cannot even get myself to watch tv or a movie, cannot read a book, cannot work. Every time I get a mere boost of energy to be positive I get more news that brings me down. Staring at a phone checking for that message that never comes. The psychic told me to change my energy. I feel like everything I do has failed and I am in such a dark place right now. I see loneliness or the company of people I force myself to be around since I am an introvert and do not connect with just anyone. I cleaned, I decluttered, i did all these positive things. Even feng shui and crystals around the place to create good energy. I thought I had the light at the end of the tunnel after that long weekend, but now, i am at such a low i really cannot get myself out of it. I do not even have those small moments of pulling it together to clean or shower like I did before. I will probably get in trouble at work but I wish I could care but just do not. Happiness should not depend on other people, i know this. But what do you do when nothing brings you joy. I was happy alone for a while, i liked myself, i saw myself as a catch and worthy of love. But now, I just feel kicked and defeated as nothing will ever change and all the men I like do not want me. The men I do not see a connection with romantically try to hurt me. or manipulate me. If life is settling, what is the point. If all there is work and exercise. I just do not see the joy in life. I give up. I am really really sad right now. I feel my life is pointless. Like is life really just holding on every day? There has to be more than just holding on. I was able to work through a lot of things but now I do not feel it. I do not feel like life gets better. I just feel defeated and at the lowest darkness I have ever felt. I overcame things for what? I feel so dark and low. Thanks to whoever is reading this and letting me vent this, long annoying rambling. I have hit my lowest low in life as of today...I just give up",Depression
11833,"A year ago, I used to talk to people and express myself pretty easily, and whenever Id say something the words would not feel fake, or they would mean what I would say. But ever since school started, last year I have become a husk of what i used to be, I cannot really motivate myself to do anything at all, especially communicate with others, I used to have an urge to talk to others and try to be funny, but it feels like I lost all of that, I feel hollow constantly, and I do not have any personality anymore, whenever I am on call with someone it feels like I am just pretending to be an interesting person, and when I run out of things to say, my mind is empty, and I just sit on call in silence, trying to desperately think of something interesting to say or hold onto. I am talking to this girl and I feel like she is losing interest because of my nonexistent communication skills and its hurting me a lot, I have lost my personality pretty much, I feel like a robot or something trying to imitate a human.

On our way home I got a call from another place to go in for an interview. That one I was able to make. It was group interview a little nerve raking but I thought I did well. They did too.

11845,"long story, but here I go (please do not mind my grammar mistakes or if things are said randomly, I dropped out early In my life) I grew up in a really poor family of five, living in a small two bedroom apartment in California. the bedroom was shared by my brother, sister, and I. my father was mentally and physically abusive to my siblings and I including my mother and I realized it when I was 8. it was a really harsh realization at such a young age and it honestly makes me feel like shit knowing I never had a childhood because my parents would never let me outside or have friends over. as I grew older, I realized that I had to grow up early so I always tried my best at everything, tried to get the best grades I could, tried to make friends, tried to be social with people, but it all failed and that is when it all started. I was maybe around 14 when I first started sneaking alcohol and weed I found in my parents room and god it fucked me up so badly.my body could not take any of it, especially the alcohol but I kept coming back to it because I found it to be a temporary escape.soon after, I dropped out due to failing grades and behavioral issues which lead to my worsening downwards spiral.now it is been a couple years and my father died due to heart failure and other complications but I never felt any kind of sadness twords his death, I did not go to his funeral either because I could not bear to look at him. however, all of those feelings I should have felt are now coming back and I feel like absolute shit because I feel like even though he want abusive, I should have built a relationship with him.I spent my whole like being jealous of everyone who has a happy relationship with their fathers and it really fucking pains me to know I never had one with mine. my heart is racing because I am not use to opening up to people but, it is the internet so why not? I have lived with depression and anxiety my entire life and it is been eating me alive it feels like. nothing makes me genuinely happy anymore, not even my cat or my boyfriend of three years and I am honestly thinking of ending it all. I have cheated on my boyfriend and I hate admiring it. it was around 5 months into the relationship when I did it and I honestly feel like shit about it still and I cannot get over it. I hate knowing that I have hurt someone that I claimed to love so badly. it makes me want to end it all. I use more than weed now too, and it makes me feel worse. I have tried to overdose four times recently but all have failed and god, what am I going to do if I cannot even successfully kill myself? please help me. I know suicide is not the only way but it feels right because of everything I have done. I might delete this later, I am kind of high right now I have hit what seems to be rock bottom",Depression
11847,"Once I had depression 3 years ago, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because suicide was the only way to get out of the pain that I was fighting. Nowadays, things have changed. I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way. This is what throws me into a deeper pain because every time I dream of it I found that I will not be able to get.As I wrote in the title I do not want to die and I know that no one truly wants to die.

I have youth, energy, but lack time as I know it will end one day and I will age. I see myself as an observer and do not attract many people socially. I have not put much effort into (romantic or social) relationships most of them have gravitated towards me. I do not know if it is my stare or my looks but I do know I struggle expressing myself verbally at times. Most of the people I tend to avoid are those that bring aggression or some form of untreated resentment. I cannot tolerate a whiner or someone who believes they are better than someone else because of something material or circumstances they had no control over.***Boom COVID and Quarantine:***I realized the world is not meant for solitude and I craved interaction even if it was meaningless conversation about weather. I met a person online that I felt comfortable with going steady we saw each other casually for about 8 months before I proposed something steady, I told this person about my past and trust issues. Childhood, etc. I have been in a relationship with this person for about 10 months now and my thoughts are re-surfacing. I find myself of scenarios that play out and then start feeling as if they are true.***Adding color:***I work from home and I go to the gym every day after work. During work I could be focused on a task and once the task is complete my mind does not know what my partner is doing and it bothers me when I do not receive constant communication. I do not want to be needy anymore. I find myself thinking of driving to where they live to observe them just to check they are not cheating or something. I find myself thinking of entering their social media pages to read messages etc.***My ask:***What can I do to lessen these thoughts and let go? I tried prayer, I tried meditation, I tried learning hobbies, focusing on myself and being okay with being cheated on. I do not know what else to do as it is becoming a constant pattern in my relationships. So much so that I do not know if I can continue my current relationship without hurting the person without intentions but through my thoughts becoming reactions.tldr; I choose to cheat on people I love and get annoyed with putting up with them after a certain point. I focus on the initial stages a lot but then have trouble with my own likes/dislikes that I start adopting their likes/dislikes and get depressed. I want to stop the cheating and I want to build a normal healthy relationship but I do not know what steps to take. I have been to therapy, yoga, took meditation courses, I am a Christian, pray A LOT, exercise, etc. is it depression or something worse?",Depression
11874,"I was a good kid all my life. Never got into any trouble, got good grades, was doing what I was ""supposed to do"". High school was the highest point in my life! I was the conventional smart kid and got into an alright university. I thought college would be great but instead I started losing friends (mostly because I did not keep in touch as I was always ""too busy""). I made several acquaintances in college, but just one of them is close enough to me to call a friend. Now that I will actually be graduating college, I have realised I have done nothing but waste my 4 years. I spent 4 years feeling sorry for myself for getting into a ""bad university"" (which it was not as bad as I thought in my head). Now here is everyone graduating with one of the best jobs this world could offer for my stream and I am here feeling sorry for myself. I stopped taking meetings with the companies that were actually interested in me because I felt I was better than that. I feel like I did everything right, and I even sacrificed friendship for this career and it did not seem to work out as well.Now even the companies like the ones that I refused to talk to will not respond back. Every morning I apply to a 100 jobs and get a shitty automated reply a week later saying how they do not want to hire me. I cannot afford myself any longer. Moreover I do not think I would have any respect back home going back as an unemployed person.Four years ago, I promised my mom I would help her move to bigger house after I get my job. But 4 years ago, I was a smart kid (at least in my head). I have not graduated yet. And by the looks of it in the time I would be, I probably will be unemployed and without friends. I cannot go back to my old friends without seeming like a freeloader who talks to them only when in trouble and I do not think I have to face to go back the same small house my mom always complained about saying ""hey look mom, I am unemployed and useless"". The pandemic certainly has not helped. Even if I do get a job, it will probably be a shitty job, given my condition now, where I will just be a cog in a machine from which I would probably less than a few pennies. Maybe life's just like that. No one's getting that big house. No one's getting anything they want. everyone is just smiling and lying through their teeth about how happy they are while they are sad people just one incident away from jumping from a cliff. Maybe that is just my perspective. Maybe I am wrong. I do not know. But I certainly am sure about one this. I am not going back home with this face. Last I have been happy was 5 years ago.

So I asked my bf to move in with me but he denied giving some lame reason, and said that we will live together later. He visits me whenever I have a big break down(in a month or so) but I want to have some solution for my situation, I do not want to have big depressive episodes time and again. it is hampering my career. I do not have any friends and even if I tell someone, they just ignore it and say things like: ""do not be depressed, I know it is hard"".

11882,"27yo Male, good life experiences including backpacking Vietnam, visited Paris and Barcelona, enjoyed cities like Nashville, Boston, Montreal, Scottsdale, moved to FL with my gf at 25 on a whim. Successful sales career making six figures since 21, averaged a new car every 9 months and currently own 5. On my second home owned which is valued at $500k. Working on opening my first business now. [I wanted to include this because I feel people that know me on the outside assume I would be extremely happy with my life and my successes, but if anything it is caused me more pain and loneliness and THINGS are not the answer to anyone's depression. Also do not assume the people that appear to be in good places, really are in their mind, we just bandaid our problems with stuff to hide our problems from ourselves]I have struggled with depression and anxiety my whole life, as early as 3rd grade I can remember pitifully trying to strangle myself with a balloon string (sounds silly how unrealistic that was looking back). I have tried ecstacy a handful of times but never in conjunction with peaks of depression and anxiety. After almost 8 years in the car business which definitely worsened my depression/anxiety significantly, i left to explore myself and start my own business which really took a toll on myself. This worsened since I took myself off of buproprion and sertraline 5 months ago after losing my insurance. Recently my girlfriend and I decided to do some ecstacy with just us at home, it was extremely therapeutic in regard to my mental health. There are 100% health downsides I am sure to this, but for my extremely infrequent use I am not worried about the downsides. here is how it helped me.To describe my mental health state prior to, I felt very empty and constantly in fight or flight. I have very little enjoyment in anything and found myself breaking down and crying more often to a breaking point. Why was I breaking down and crying? Because I felt so guilty thinking how badly I wish I could just disappear and how unfair it was to tell my sister who just had her first child that I did not want to be there to watch him grow. Or to tell my girlfriend that i do not want to start our life and family together because I would rather be gone. To clarify, i do not want to hurt or kill myself. But i cried even harder because I also was so destroyed realizing that the only answer is to stay and feel so empty and useless for the sake of everyone else which meant a life of pain for me. There was no winning.When we did ecstacy it allowed me to feel again (assuming a Seratonin pump) and it allowed me to appreciate. I was able to hold my girlfriend and just feel joy, feel how much she meant to me and how much i enjoyed her presence. It allowed me to remember what made life worth living, what happiness was like. I was able to work through all those thoughts inside with a fresh palate and an open mind. I was able to address things with myself that i was afraid to address. Think ways that I have not been able to for a long time. I had a shit eating grin the entire time and just felt so alive again. The next day was even better because it was a much lesser baseline but just enough to get through the day with the ability to feel good. Eventually the euphoria went away but my mind was at ease. Just because the ""high"" stopped, i was still able to work through my thoughts with myself and affirm my reasoning for being around. Unlike other drugs, you will likely remember your experience from ecstacy and similar drugs so that you can take away your thoughts with you. All in all, if you are in a very stuck place and unable to crawl out, i honestly feel a controlled experience like this may be good to let you revisit your life from a new perspective again and reason your way out of your hole. I am curious to hear people's opinions on this, either for or against. Happy to answer questions as well. Anyone use Ecstacy while depressed? My experience.",Depression
11884,"Hi,I am in a rough place right now with no one to turn to, so here is hoping typing it out will make a difference.A bit of background: I am nearly 30, and I suffer from anxiety and depression. My natural response to my anxiety is getting lost in my computer - games, movies, Reddit.. When I am distracted I am not anxious. So I isolate myself. As the anxiety creeps closer, I close off to the world. I spend all my waking hours in front of my computer. I do not go out, not even to shop. Isolation and depression are the best of friends, so any motivation to do even the simplest stuff goes out the window. I do not cook. I order junk food, because cooking is too much. So I sit on my ass and get fatter, hating myself more and more, knowing I am in a vicious cycle, but feeling absolutely powerless to help it.Now, I know the last 18 months have been crazy, but I would have isolated myself nonetheless. So, things are not going great, but last week they went from bad to worse. I became homeless. I saw it coming, but sadly my area has a bit of a housing crisis. I could not even get a spot at a homeless shelter.So, as you might imagine, being homeless with crippling anxiety and depression, having only been outside twice the last 18 months, that was a bit rough.Luckily I managed to secure a couch, but having no family and with friendships having been neglected, due to my isolation, it was a very close call on me sleeping on the streets.Today, I got my new apartment. 250km from everyone and everything I have ever known. Unable to yet secure transport for my stuff, I am sitting on the floor writing this and I will be sleeping on the floor for the next while.Reality has caught up to me and hit me like a ton of bricks. As I am sitting here on the floor contemplating just how much I fucked up my life, it all feels a bit hopeless. It is so hard not to have a single person in your life that you can rely on.So here I sit all alone. Feeling like the biggest loser in the world and without even a bed to crawl into and try to forget my problems. What do normal people do when they get this sad?",Depression
11885,"I am at my wits end. I grew up in a broken home, parents who physically fought and abused drugs and alcohol. I was abandoned by my parents as a teenager and had to look after myself and meet my physical needs from the age of 13 - I had no one to give me love and emotional support - for that I turned to unhealthy habits. I grew up hanging out with a bad crowd and we were taken advantage of by an adult we should have trusted. I have made terrible decisions about people I let into my life because I was not shown what a healthy relationship was, I have witnessed my best friend drown, I have lost countless friends and family members before I even turned 20. Yet, somehow I climbed out of these dark holes, I am nearly thirty and still learning how to take care of myself - adult things that no one showed me. I studied at someone of the top universities in my field, have experience career-wise so am able to get a job to feed myself and put a roof over my head. I have travelled extensively and currently live abroad - my friends often express their envy of my life. But the thing is I am miserable, I am tired of it all I want the memories to leave I want the pain to stop. I have been to therapy but the memories do not go they are still there and I do not want them anymore. I figure I have two options to end it all and forget - or pack my backs live a life free from any worry - these options feel like two sides of the same coin for me. Because if I end it all I might as well ignore the all-consuming anxiety that takes over my life. I am so over it. I just wish I had a better start in life instead of continually being dragged down by my blacken-heart. Life has been hard and I want to forget it",Suicidal
11890,"Two days ago, I had my first mental breakdown at work because I was blamed for everything for a mistake which in my opinion was not my fault, crying for 15 minutes (at home, homeoffice)Let me summarize what happened. I am a sales (not manager) guy, and I am in charge of pricing and getting orders from my customers and especially maintaining the situation for new/R&amp;D projects and its sample phases. I have one senior (manager) colleague from purchasing who is in charge of purchase and she is responsible for preparing stock. So we have to (unfortunately) keep in touch and work together as she needs to know the project situation from my customers and prepare stock accordingly.So, in beginning of this year, my customer gave me information of the material list and that SOP is scheduled for November 2021. The lead times for us to prepare is long (40+ weeks), thus my colleague keeps asking me if she should issue orders to our suppliers. As I did not want to go for any risks, I warned my customer about the lead times and said they should release firm orders to us, so I have a commitment and know they will buy the stuff we prepare. My customer kept saying the list is still not finalized but the list would go to the forecast soon and release order soon and they are aware of the lead times. I explained to my colleague to only order if we have something firm and she agrees, and says she would wait until the list of items are in our customer's purchase list/forecast in their system.Still, in mid of 2021 we still have not received any firm orders and I kept pushing my customer every week. The only reply was, that orders will come soon. Then, last week I received feedback from my customer that the list got smaller and only 4 of the 10 original items are needed (Still no order from customer). At the moment my colleague told our director that we actually already issued order to our supplier (to my surprise) for the 10 items and I am at fault for now having dead stock because I am bad at managing this. Furthermore, She kept asking and harassing me why the customer did not release any orders despite SOP is November. I told her I explained to the customer many times and they said they understand the situation and will wait with the lead time. Furthermore, it is not our fault if the customer does not release orders when we explained them many times the conditions. Well, she did not care or give a fuck.So after that my colleague harassed me for being bad at this job and managing poorly and being fault for having dead stock now (SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PURCHASES TO OUR SUPPLIERS!!!!), she of course snitched and complained at out managing director and blamed everything on me. Because I am quite the small fry compared to her in the company hierarchy, the director at first believed only her story and continued criticizing me. Every try of me to explain that I told her to only order when there is commitment from customer, and that we did not know the list of materials was still pending until last week, was seen as a poor excuse. My director looked for reasons to blame me, such as it was also my responsibility to oversee what is ordered and to tell the customer they need to buy our stuff if we already prepare that for them. When I tried to say we should not have ordered at the first place which is her responsibility, I was just shut down.After that I just hoped to die with my 30 years instantly. I was just frustrated of everything and wanted to cease to exist and cried in the corner for 15 minutes.... I think this is what we call power harassment in the office and I guess I was the victim... Never felt so miserable but I think this is unfortunately quite common in work life. I am at this company now for 4 years and I realized the senior purchasing colleague is a bigshot because she is good at maintaining her juniors low and never letting anyone overtake her. She keeps all the difficult work for herself so that no one can replace her. So unfortunately, even if she has problems with some colleagues, she is not easily replaceable.Today my superior helped me and we had a 2 hour meeting with my director explaining what I did for this project since 2020 and made clear that I never supported the idea to order stuff without commitment from customer. Thank god, after that my director believed me and said he will check why our purchasing team ordered the stuff....But still, I still feel miserable for being blamed and that senior colleague from purchasing of mine will for sure continue to do so next time and blame everyone for little mistakes as long as she benefits from that...I used to be such a motivated man when I started working, now I just realize how fuckup this worklife can be....

I am the third parent. my dad was raped before he even turned double digits and is stuck in the same mindset as he was when he was raped. my whole childhood was my mother chasing after my sister who was trafficked, on drugs all the time, even just running away from home. i wish my mom never had us stupid fucking children when she has even said herself she does not want to be a parent anymore. i felt abandon by her. before someone says anything about therapy, i have tried and tried to get a therapist and have had them before. i was doing outpatient, i think it was, they would take me out of my house to walk around, try and help my anxiety by going into stores and talking to the cashiers, stuff like that. my mom did not like that at all, she would say that they are just babying me. I have made it such a habit to not open up whatsoever, especially to my mother, and when i do TRY to open up, i feel disgusting and cringey saying how i feel. i try distancing myself from people because no matter how someone speaks to me, i always get irritated and feel like i could punch a whole through the wall. living with my mother would be an absolute fucking nightmare and I am seriously thinking about killing myself either before i have to move or when I am there.

Why I do it is because for years I was beating myself up for those less obvious symptoms, because I was not aware that it goes hand in hand with depression and thought I was simply mentally and emotionally weak, compared to everybody else. Since I had this epiphany that it might be directly associated to depression, I understand my mind much better, which I find to be helpful for myself. This leads me to have more compassion for myself and knowing, that this is not necessarily who I am. It has often been pointless trying to solve those problems (which I was trying to do for years), because as long as I am/was depressed, there was literally *nothing* I could do about those less obvious symptoms. it is like working hard for having no results, and then hating myself for not making any progress at all. So I hoped to help some of the people here too.Disclaimer:This list does not serve to be self-diagnosed and many of the points do not have to have anything to do with depression.Again: these are the LESS OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS.

11893,"I have been trying to tune into how i feel more lately and i cannot stop thinking about one thing in particular - it is usually assumed that suicidal folks are more likely to attempt/commit when they are at the lowest point in their life, and, i mean, it does seem logical. but what I have also noticed is that when I am at my lowest i do not really think about it, and instead i think more about how i wish the pain was over and similar things. but when it gets a little better and when I am back to not doing things on autopilot, that is when i start thinking about it. and it causes kind of a dissonance because i feel better and the situation is better, but at the same time i want to just end it all more than ever. like, for example, I am done with school for the summer, i got a job offer recently, i have not had a flare up in weeks (got a chronic condition), I have made a lot of progress on the book I am currently writing and I have been catching up on a lot of shows and movies - long story short, i have a lot of distractions. but at the same time i feel like absolute shit and every time i go to sleep i hope i do not wake up, and when i do wake up, i think about how much i want this to end.is this how other people feel too? how do you deal with that? usually the go-to advice is to find distractions, but what if distractions \*are\* what is making it worse? when distractions actually make it worse",Suicidal

A 8-5 job on Monday to Friday and Saturday from 8-3. My work used to be just doing paperwork and giving assistance to my supervisors. Making receipts to customers,making payment to supplier, filing documents and so on. On the last few weeks my job workload increased a lot, my supervisor and boss keep calling us to do counter sales job because they are being too busy making delivery orders and invoice,or should I say my boss is does not want to hire new people even though we are understaffed.At first I am fine, but when it goes on and on I realized I had no time for own work and started feeling burnout every day.Every morning when I woke up, I literally had anxiety going for my job. I keep stressing out about things they are going to go wrong in my work environment and having fear going to work simply because I am just too tired waking up every morning stressing out over the same thing over and over again in order to satisfy this company's lust and needs.My boss also keep adding work to me which includes calling me to learn POS system because he wanted the counter sales more self-sufficient and making sure the money in drawer is tally with our system. But I know nothing about the system, I try to ask my colleagues about the POS system and no one wanted to help me with it, they are all selfish people who just want to complete their own job without being bother by other people. I do not know is this the chinese culture or not but every senior in my office seems to be lazy and do not want to care a bunch about others people work even though they are supervisor of their position. This is not included in my job descriptions when I first entered the company and makes me felt puzzled it too.My boss also wanted me to create a KPI system for the company in order to maintain good work ethics and making sure everybody voice got heard. But from what I know and see that, this company workers have frequent complain over the years but my boss just would not care a thing, so I exactly do not know what this kpi system is for and I had no time for doing it also.I had think about quitting the job more than a few times already but I am afraid I cannot find another job because of it.I am just a 20 years old male where I had no chance going to college Because my family is not rich and they also having a concept of ""only work will makes you Rich instead of study""My mum being a little bit considerate saying that even though you want to go to college who going to pay for your college fees?I am kind of puzzled now for my future, I saw all my friends having a plan and a target in their life.

I have been depressed since the age of 15 and the feeling of starting with nothing and getting no help into the adult world is really making me think about not wanting to be here no more.

11911,"I am a female and 20 years old. I have been hiding a secret from everyone for a long time and it is the reason why I think about death everyday. Nobody knows about this, not even my parents know how bad it is. About 2 years ago, I found something on my vulva which looked unfamiliar. I had to go to the hospital to check it. It turns out that I had 2 cysts on my clitoral hood skin, and they had to be removed because of possible malignancy. The surgeries did not go well. First I was quite shocked, because it looked a bit different, but I might could have lived with it still. But then, around 5 months after the surgery and when the doctors also told me that everything healed well now, I got a random scar infection out of the blue. Now I have a quite significant scar on the right side on my clitoral hood. My labia minora and clitoris were left intact but because of this, I cry everyday. The whole experience was so traumatic I got pretty severe PTSD. I cannot even talk to a psychologist about it. People on dating apps have called me pretty and what not, but I always backed off when they asked for a date because I thought its senseless anyways. I do not want to tell my story to everyone I get intimate with since its pretty traumatic, and who is still going to like me with all these scars? It just looks horrible in my opinion, I feel like a monster when I look at myself. I am just doomed to die forever alone. Since this happend, I fantasize about death everyday. I also isolated myself from most people because of this secret and I cannot tell anyone about it. I would love to atleast have a friend or someone to cuddle with but I also did not really find that. my biggest secret - a life without love",Suicidal
11913,"I just found this community and I am just curious as to how does depression feel. Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them, my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything. I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed, I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding me.But sometimes out of nowhere, without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely, like no one cares about me, deep down I know that is not true, but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then. I am an overthinker, and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life, this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff, I am feeling a lot better. But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes, as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here. it is weird, I just feel like no one would understand, idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts. But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love, that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me, that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side, realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid, but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly, but idk if that is just making me close off, make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels... So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am, i am not insecure of myself either, I am happy with everyone that is with me right now, well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good, my family, my bf and the few friends I trust. But doubts suddenly invade my mind and do not let me see stuff as great as it actually is. So ye idk what to call this or how to overcome it sometimes. it is not always but when it happens it really puts me down in a fking hole. What does depression feel like?",Depression

11924,"Just to adress this: I have not been diagnosed with any mental illness. Though I have been showing major indicators of depression and anxiety disorder since quite a few years.I came here because lately I have been feeling very prone to hurting myself. I have cut myself before, the last time is maybe a month ago. I do not have very strong urges or motivation to hurt myself, I just occasionally think about it. That is usually when my feelings have been ""gone"" for a while and it feels utterly terrible to exist. But a few times now lately when I have thought about it it has been really really bad and its scaring me. It feels as if my brain is taking over and telling me to just do it finally. As if I needed it.I do not have huge issues with selfharming, I am not in great danger of hurting myself. Currently its just that these bad thoughts come to me and I hate them. Usually I can overcome them when playing videogames with my friends, so that is good.But does anyone have advice on how to actively fight against those thoughts? Or just ways that might help me with reducing or bettering those thoughts? Thoughts about selfharm, How do I cope with it?",Depression

If my brother even got 70 percent, my parents would literally treat him like a prince and if I got the same marks or more in fact I never even got single praise out of their mouth. When I was about 10 years I had to relocate to another city only because my brother was in a boarding school and he was very homesick. I was homeschooled for 2 years and no one cared about me. A real example, when my brother was in 10th he got about 68 percent in his board examination and he was sent for a trip with his friends because my parents were proud, and when I was in 10th I got 93% and I did not even get a well done or I am proud of you, it was just okay, why did you get fewer marks in science. I recently got the presidency for 2 departments in my school, and when I told my mother she just said okay, can you fucking believe it, just an OKAY. I just never feel enough, be it in my family, my friendships, or my relationship. Whatever I do, I can never be good enough. At this point, I do not even know if anyone cares about me for a second. I do not remember the last time I felt happy, all I remember is feeling sad, that is IT, THE ONLY EMOTION I FEEL. I hate feelings, I hate getting attached, I hate trusting someone, I have my mother, I hate it. I do not know if anyone will relate, but I always feel like I have lost myself. This just is not me.

11931,"The last couple of months has been hard for me mentally. I was always a fully motivated and positive person, with a ""never give up"" and can-do attitude, who was treated as a ""role model"" by my peers. I supported many friends when they had hardships, yet when my world is crumbling, I feel left alone. I read articles on how to deal with my depression, regain control and stay positive, yet during days like this, I am unable to do anything, just staying idle in this weird state of being empty, which is frustrating. So far, every time I have had this state I just tried to survive this mood until the next day or a better moment, however, recently I feel like I am running out of energy to do so. I am slowly tired of trying and failing again. I just need to share my problems with someone else, but not related to me, so I would not feel embarrassed showing my weaknesses. Even drunk I am not able to open up, trying to maintain the perception of me being strong and firm. I am 26. 6 years in a relationship, last 9 months I spent abroad doing my MSc, hence my long-distance relationship drifted apart, which probably is the main because of my anxiety and lack of control. It was always my safe haven, which now is sinking. We made plans that in sept-oct this year, we will graduate and relocate to a different country, be engaged and start building our own family. Now, my gf is not sure if she still wants to be with me, does not see me as a future husband and lost her love. We decided to try and rebuild this bond, but it causes me a lot of stress and anxiety when she is wavering, while I am doing my best. it is killing me that I cannot do anything, but wait and be patient. I struggle with my dissertation topic because I just do not feel it. I hate the ""research and academic"" way. I would like to make something practical, instead of just referencing existing research and doing interviews... I am running of time, yet my supervisor is not helping me, instead, he put more pressure on me, that it is my fault and others are doing great...BSc in engineering, MSc in Managemet, a lot of academic experience, but lack of real working experience (just side jobs, which are not related, volunteering etc.) and I wasted some of my time just having fun with friends, games, and so on. Now, I am keep being rejected even though, I do my best with my CV, personalised cover letters and assessment tests... I wish to finally start my career to be fully independent from my parents, but since COVID-19 and being MSc student I did not have a real chance to get a job. Next month I will go to a warehouse as in the past (mentioned side-jobs), but it is frustrating that I am a talented person, career advisor is saying I am fine, while I am still being dependent and unemployed... Due to being abroad, my old friends turned away from me, having their new friends, work, families etc. Meanwhile, my parents are telling me that I should be strong and my depression and problems are exaggerated. Basically, they ignored my feelings. I feel a little bit better now, saying this out loud (thanks!), although I know it will not change anything in a long term... I am losing control over my life, which slowly pushes me to suicidal thoughts.",Depression

11935,"I am 21 years old, 22 in September. Until I was about 17, my life was in perfect harmony. Good grades, happy relationship, excited for the future.But that did not last. My dads alcohol addiction finally overcame him, despite multiple attempts at rehab, and he disappeared for about 2 months before being found dead in an apartment. he would basically drank himself to death. And then, the next year, my lovey grandmother - who Id formed a very close bond with following the loss of her son/my father - also passed away, from an unexpected and aggressive cancer. After that, everything just went south. I became short-tempered, angry at the world. The relationship I was in ended soon after, and worst of all, she found someone else after just 2 weeks (bearing in mind wed been together for 2 years at that point). So I went to university, hoping that getting away from home would be a sort of reset; a new start, so to speak.Nope within about a month I was smoking weed, popping pills, and living every self-destructive fantasy I could think of. It was fun at the time, a nice release, but in the long run it was anything but.Fast-forward to next year, the diagnosis comes in: Post traumatic stress disorder, generalised anxiety and depressive disorder. And I have now blown almost all the money left to me from dad on cigarettes and drugs.And to top it all off, I failed uni. So I am now poor, unemployed, and realising that I have gone down EXACTLY the same road as dad did. Like I did not learn anything from watching his mistakes.I do not really know where I am going with this, to be honest. I know that I am to blame, and nobody else. But I just felt like I needed to get all this off my chest.Thank you to anyone who took the time to read I am not suicidal or anything, at least not yet, just looking for some guidance honestly x I feel like I have made so many mistakes in life",Depression
11938,"A ramble, sorry. I have no friends, no family, no life, no job, no hobbies, no money, and most importantly as of right now, no health insurance to get better to possibly get help to fix myself to have these things. If I cannot get therapy or medication or psychiatric help then nothing matters. Everyone throws around get therapy when someone is struggling but not everyone fucking can, so stop telling people that, its infuriating. A huge debt and hospital bill will probably make me want to die more; so? I am paranoid all the time, I cannot stop analyzing every single thing to death. I do not think right anymore. thought negatively for so long I believe it. I do not think people can change, I try and try and I keep going back to how I was. It has to be untrue that you can get better because I have done so much and I am not. I am miserable, I am sad all the time. I do not care about life. do not care about even finding something enjoyable to do because I just do not care. I do not care about any of the things everyone else cares about (family, career, hobby blah blah blah) I do not believe in purpose or meaning because we are just a bag of cells, some hyper intelligent apes that just run around a world that tells you how to live and defines you based on looks, money, success. I am extremely self conscious and insecure, I have tried every single thing to fix this and actually for once like myself but you cannot do that if you actually do not like yourself, can you force yourself to like someone else? No. So why should I force myself to like myself when I literally cannot because I am hideous and disgusting and getting older. We used to not live until we were 30 before modern medicine and such, but now we are prolonged to live until we are seen as worthless. Ageism is a thing. I have suffered with anorexia for 8 years, I was abused and neglected as a child and then abused again at 19. I am 22. I miss being young as well, I hate that I am 22 and I do not want to age anymore I rather die young than die old pissing myself in my diaper and being alone. I never leave my house, I hate people so very much. They seem selfish, dangerous, and I cannot relate to their minds because they operate correctly and mine is going a million miles a second. I think deeply about thinking deeply. I am scared and anxious so much from everything and trauma its physically effecting me. I am fatigued and sleep and act like I am sick. Maybe I am sick but cannot afford any medical care!!! I hate my body, face, hair, and skin. I hate my personality, my voice, my thoughts and thinking patterns. My family is gone or have been the reason of how fucked up I am. My friends hate me and moved on years ago. I only have a SO and they are why I am here today. But, my insecurities and jealously is ruining that too. I am not good enough in so many ways, I am so miserable its showing up everywhere and again there is no help for me. I cannot even afford sliding scale help or any of the fucking rest. My sleep is not even restful as nightmares haunt me daily and make me wake up so so so sad. God, I wake up sad every day. My body hurts, my heart is broken. I just do not want to live here anymore but I really do not want to hurt my SO, but I have been so strong for so fucking long just for my SO, but I cannot take it anymore I cannot do this anymore and I cannot breathe because of how much I hurt. Nothing can help at this point I am seriously too far gone. I cannot function at all, I cannot socialize. I do not want to live poor anymore because I am too anxious for work, I do not want to live. I do not want to die either I really fucking am scared and terrified of death but the pain I feel the aching dull feeling of despair in my stomach is just too fuckingr much right now. I am safe right now but I am writing this out because I lurked this sub for so long and I wanted to write 10% of what is going on and figure out what to fucking do from here.

11956,"Today, i have come to the sea side for my sister's wedding. There was a lighthouse at the furthest part of the bay. I just felt i have to go there everytime. For five days, I went to the lighthouse and thought just thought. We were preparing for a wedding but i was depressed and feeling lonely for a reason. Today's visit was pretty harsh with too much wild thoughts. Eventually i found why i was sticked to that lighthouse. Two years ago, I was at my highschool graduation party. Whole class whom are graduating was only 50 to 60 people and so everybody knows each other. After the party has come to slow music for dancing, i was just shy as f*ck to dance. For other impacts on me , i was actually the first one on exams and everybody knew me for a reason so, i was not the guy nobody cared but the one who was cared. Anyway, i was there standing some people trying to raise me to dance but i am rejecting for some fckng religious reasons. I got my seat next to my friend who also did not come up to dance. The neat part is here which is still I hate myself. For the 4 years and some before the girl i loved was there just sitting maybe hoping for a dance. But nobody did not tell her. Maybe this was the chance for a last moment i would see and maybe know her but i could not. FOR FCKNG REASONS! i could not do it. I was shy and idiot. I knew that this love was not just a simple thing but to write poets and think always. Maybe it is creepy for 4 years i did this. But as i said, some religious things blocked me. Also, i was preparing for University exam and i was scaring that what if i cannot succeed in the exam for this love. I had pressed my feelings deep inside but they have never gone. That day was the most crashing moment for me to remind me why i am a failure and idiot. Today, because i am in my sister's wedding, people are going to watch me and of course i have to raise someone to dance. And my cousin who looked liked with her face and hairs just like my love. I am not pervert and i know she is my cousin but my love has never passed away and i still remember her.So i will raise her to dance today and i will cry as fck inside for that old day. Well, this seems simple for some people here but that lighthouse and sitting there alone watching the sea reminded me that I have succeeded in the exam but this life i have put my everything is not what i can go for a life span. I do not know how to enjoy life. I have wasted my 4 years and only thing defines my life is my successful exam. Everybody knows me because of my University. I am disappeared behind my success. And this is my fault. Not raising my love to dance is my fault. Wasting my life for chasing money is my fault. I was just looking the sea to jump in and never swim up. I am living in a body not doing what i wanted but only chasing money and career. Two hours ago, I had a choice to make. I could jump in and disappearing from this world for good. But i had another chance to change my life maybe. Maybe I cannot say this was a desicion because I do not want to ruin my sister's wedding. It would be pretty selfish. Anyway I decided to not wait or hesitate myself to do anything. I chose what my life should be. If you have read this whole, thank you. Now maybe, you can talk to your loved ones. Just go and ignore anything. Not doing this, will ruin your life for a long time. A Decent Reminder",Suicidal

I spend a lot of my day crying as pathetic as it sounds. crying over how I am treated, how I look, if I eat a cereal grain I did not have planned I obsess about it until I feel sick. I desperately need a fresh start and I know how to get one. Its far away but I have dreams of sand and stars. I am going to take the money and run. Not under the false pretense its enough to live on but because when I finally leave ill at least feel alive. id be homeless and alone. but alive. 2 grand and no plan.

I have been estranged From family for nearly 10 years. I am on the verge of completing suicide.

I just cannot cope with the daily fluctuations and severe emotional agony each day. I have no one to hug, to cry with, to laugh with etc. I am desperate. I am convinced I will end my life this weekend. I have put all the hard work in. I have. I know that is something that needs maintenance but my illness is winning. Anyone know what this is like?

11971,"I am single and never been in a real relationship out of the fact that that idea of commitment scares me and I have not met anyone that i feel comfortable enough to say i date them. Recently I have had a string of recurring dreams of women whether I am close to them or feel an attraction to them whether its a genuine connection or sexual pleasures varies but one thing is the same, i wake up and am saddened. After each one of those dreams my first thought is, it was a dream huh?. Although it is also my own fault since my inability to know fact from fiction in my dreams is addictive like being in a VR game where I am happy until i take the headset off. Deep down i find myself craving those dreams and try to lie to myself like i do not just so I do not think about how pathetic i feel. The truth is I am so alone and it scares me. Opening up to people personally is extremely hard since just like my choice of love interest, I am picky with who i talk with. Its easier to think of it has having certain levels of access. My closest friends having the highest access to my feelings and thoughts while everyday friends barely have access to what i want them to see of me. I have not had a close friend since early to mid highschool which was a few years ago and without anyone i trust enough to be a close friend I am stuck with my own thoughts trying to figure out how to feel. For the longest I thought id be fine, i did not need anyone else but truth is my own mind is eating itself alive and bit by bit I am losing parts of me and it will only get worse. I cannot stop it at this point. I have lost a lot of myself and fear this is the spiral to the end and I am desperately clinging for a hand that i ultimately will never take.I am sorry to the future person i choose to help me with this baggage.

The last week she went a little quiet and I asked if everything is ok and she is come out saying she is second guessing being in a relationship as she likes her freedom of being on her own but she loves spending time together but her introvert personality does not know. I reassure her that I am happy to go at whatever pace she wants she just has to be honest and she brings up that she was never looking for a relationship on the app and did not expect to meet someone she likes this much. I never told her I have feelings for her just that I really like her and care about her, and she said because she is confused she feels so shit since we have feelings each other but the prospect of being in a relationship makes her uncomfortable right now. She asked for my advice and I said look right now if we end it it will not make sense, you just said you have feelings for me how about we continue to see each other after lockdown and of something happens it does. She agreed and stated she wants to try instead of just giving up. She lives on her own so I am thinking the anxiety and loneliness might be getting to her and she is a little in her own head? Even though we have been dating for 5 months I really like her. I have had a rough 3 years dealing with family loss, getting made redundant from one job, my business I started before Covid doing well then failing due to the pandemic, dealing with toxic relatives over an inheritance.

Those negative thoughts are just that, a moment, a single thought, a drop in the sea that is love.One day, One minute, one second, one more miracle to experience.You are loved.You are love.Someone commented this on a Reddit thread.I had to speak on it for people that I feel have the same mentality as me, but holy FUCK I appreciate anyone who has ever lent a hand to someone who needs it that did not ask, and their situation improved just off that interaction because it goes a long way.On the other hand, I have to she would light of the situation for those who do not have the same dark, repetitive, and hopeless thoughts.Bear with me :) this is my head.Your motivation is helpful in every way you wanted it to be..but in the right hands?? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, right? Of course I hear you, and appreciate you; and others when you say people are here for me.but its like in one ear, and out the other. What can someone else do for methat I cannot even do for myself because I do not care.? Honestly. It comes hand in hand with depression obviously how little you care depends, on you as a person, and the actions you take from thereidk. Just speaking on how I feel right now of course. I have heard it plenty. do not make a long term solution for a temporary problem. I would never take my own lifebut honestly I am left feelingnothing. Every morning. Every night. Constant mental war with myself that I do not have the fight for anymore. I just do not care. I do not want the help. I know its therebut I do not see a future? I do not want a future?

I do not want to help myself, why should I drag someone else down with me who just cannot understand my thoughts and mental state Yk?

11987,"Long post incoming. Sorry, it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid, I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out, and I stayed up all night, managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book, constantly having to re-read paragraphs, ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for ""later"" - and a book that should not take longer than a week, takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying, too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much, so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy, introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends, I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came, I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it, I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time, dropping out of 3 different majors (Chinese studies, law and computer science) because they ended up not feeling right for me, and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October, since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career, but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office, where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours, then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep - day, after day, after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself, saving up for traveling, which is what I dream of doing, is off the table. I am lonely. I do not have a girlfriend, I do not exercise, I am overweight (not obese though), I barely spend time on any other hobbies. I could be amazing at playing piano and learning Japanese, which are two things that I am interested in, if only I was willing to spend as much time on them as I am spending on video games and watching stupid bullshit on the internet. But my stupid brain refuses to actually focus and I cannot get my shit together. I have tried making a change reducing my screen time a few times, but it always falls apart after a few days tops.I need help. I do not want to be a depressed, lonely underachiever filled with regret for the rest of my days. I am a depressed, lonely, underachieving internet/video game addict with no perspectives.

11989,"I mean why. Well you will die anyway someday, why you could die now if you want ? Why it is considered bad and insane. In the past in japan for example it was a normal thing to commit suicide to remove shame of yourself and even honourable. It is ok to kill yourself this day too for some kind of protest. Then why you cannot kill yourself just for nothing? Even if you are not suffering much. Just like i do not know as a form of shame. Like i just do not understand why is it that big deal. All humans will die anyway someday what does it matter if you die some years earlier or later. All times it was ok to have honourable death. Let me have it. I just see it now optimistically and not negatively. Like you fuck up, you die. I do not know how to describe it but i see it now very optimistically. Like i do not suffer that much, but still want to die for all things i fucked up. I see it as relief, as a salvation from all fuck ups. I know i will sound like a kid but it feels so cool for me. Like the same feeling when you watch a movie with a ""tough good guy"" as a main character, who even when he is tough, he has his code ( like do not kill children, do not stab in the back, give a chance do defend himself etc.). Like those codes seems cool. This thing feels like a code for me too, so that is why it feels cool too. Why is it bad to kill yourself",Suicidal
11990,"Hello Reddit! I apologize in advance for any grammatical errors. English is not my first language. Any sort of advice, words of kindness would truly help. Thank you.I have made a post on this account before, and writing my feelings out made my pain feel a little more bearable, so I hope this does the same. I was born in a typical central European family with a loving mother, a slight narcassistic father who I dearly love and my two older sisters. My whole life always felt a little bit misplaced. My school grades were always very good, and I was reading quite advanced books from an early age, which had some consequences like; growing up too early and costant boredom at school because I did not get enough of a challange. My social life had been very poor, and I was getting constantly picked on which resulted in a low self-esteem and depression. I was eleven when I first tried to kill myself. I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for about six months, and finally got off anti-depressants last August. (Two years later).This year has been very tough. After I switched schools I have met a boy who I had feelings for and for the first time in forever, I felt truly happy. After being friends for eight months, he lead me in the woods and took advantage of me. Things have not been the same. It took me three months to hug my mom after that. I never told my family, but I did tell my closest friends. It hurted seeing him laugh with his friends, living his best life while I was sitting at the back of the class holding in another panic attack. But I can always remember who was always willing to take a walk and let me rant about my feelings, spend some silly young times together and take on the world like it was ours. It was my best friend, neighbour and someone you could call a blood-unrelated older sister. She took her life a month ago, on the hill we used to make memories on.I wonder where she is now. Dealing with her death has been a very tough experience I cannot describe. Some feelings words just cannot get a grip of. I am celebrating my fifteenth birthday in five days, and I still cannot believe I made it this far. Maybe I do not have a will to live right now, but maybe my point of living is to find it.The stars shine a little brighter now that you have joined them, Ana.

I did not feel comfortable giving head without protection but it was expected of me anyway. He came in my mouth unexpectedly which I really did not want.They told me they would happily get tested if I requested it, but that was before I slept with them. Now that I have asked them to get tested they are ignoring me and acting like its a ridiculous thing to ask. The guy was gross, I felt disgusted after sleeping with him. I only did it because his wife is a 10/10, I have no idea why she is with him. This entire experience left me feeling like I am not bisexual after all.I have told my friends I had a really bad experience last week, but men just do not give a shit about things like that. They just make jokes to try to ease the tension. Made me feel like shit. And I am too ashamed to even suggest this experience to my female friends.I hate myself for this, I am worried about my health. I have had a sore throat ever since we hooked up and am going to get tested next week. But HIV and hepatitis require you to wait 12 weeks for an accurate result.I feel used and dirty.

But I do not have the confidence or energy left to delude myself into thinking I have control over my life.I truly do not. I do not know who I am because I have spent the past four years never changing or trying anything new. Everything I have done was out of my own short-term survival, whether that may be work for school or trying to cope with stress through escapism.So here I am. I am 18, faced with reality, and I do not know how to comprehend it. Once more I do not know myself. I never had the self-love to take care of myself during my high school years. I hated myself, and destroyed a chance of forming an identity through my own fear and loathing.I do not know how to describe myself. I am many things but also absolutely nothing at all. Pretentious as that sounds, it illustrates the tenuous grasp I have of my own self.I do not know who I am. I have vague ideas of who I want to be, but I cannot do anything because I have no autonomy over my own feelings.I am in a constant state of inaction or drowning myself in escapism. I have college to worry about, I still have not chosen my classes, but how could I? I do not know who I am, and any aspiration I have ever had I have never attained because of misfortune or inaction.So I give up. I have been severly depressed for the last seven month. Every day I wanted to die. But this past month its gotten better. Why? Because of escapism and leisure. Whenever I face reality I become depressed and scared. I can only live through other peoples stories and dream.I daydream all the time. I can never manifest anything.So I give up. I have no autonomy over this person I inhibit. They feel like a different person entirely from me. They will not relent with their bullshit, bad habits, and stagnation. My spirit is different from my person.I know I will never find self-love, because that requires autonomy, decision making, and motivation. I have none. I feel deprived of anything.How am I even supposed to find a romantic partner if I do not know myself? I will always feel alienated, from myself and others.Love is so beautiful, but something I will never experience.I do not know where Ill be in a year, let alone five, but I will have made self-destructive decisions like always. Whether they be big or miniscule, I have always been too selfless. I do not mean that in a self-aggrandizing way, but in a negative way. I do not feel good about myself.This makes me sound depressed, and I probably am, but the feeling is more akin to apathy. Why even try if I will NEVER be happy with myself. Always changing my mind, always daydreaming. Every day I change my mind about who I want to be, so I am nobody.I am just here for the ride, for wherever my mind takes me. Down down down. I just will not feel the intimacy and love that others do.TLDR Anxiety killed me. Self-love and acceptance are vital to a good life. Life makes no sense.

I live at my grandparents house, I have an alcoholic dad who I barely talk to and a mother who ran away with someone else was I was younger. I do not drink or smoke because of how my dad ended up I guess I did not want to be like him. I guess I have never really had a proper social life and the few friends I do have are online friends. I have never had a girlfriend or even a female friend in person before because I tend to stutter and mess up my sentences a lot when talking to women. Honestly I have even grown to hate the way I look, I feel like I am not attractive enough for any female. I work 6 days a week full time and the only day off I have I feel like I waste it away by playing games because I have lost all motivation to go out or do something productive. I have never had anyone to give me that push to help me get back on my feet. I have been offered therapy before but I refused it.

He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it, tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg (not the best idea but he panicked). A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown, the weeks prior being full of mood swings, irritable, quick to anger, irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine, cross-titrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks (8 weeks ago). After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, extreme paranoia (effecting our relationship), obsessive thoughts, total irrational thinking, an inability to keep the bad thoughts in, quick to anger, what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently, tunnel vision, all the rest, you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better, or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long? How long did it take for them to subside? What did you do to deal with them? Is there anything I can do to help? I will take any advice at the minute because it is awful seeing someone you love in this much pain and unable to help themThank you! Citalopram Withdrawal Side Effects?!",Depression
12027,"I lost my mom then 45 days later I lost my 12 yr old son. My mom was sickly. she would told me she was tired. In the hospital, she had rallied. We thought she would be coming home. Then she did not make it. My son was extremely grief striken. I realized he was not ok. I sent him to therapy. 3 days later, he was gone. I found him. My only baby. I went to the store and when I got back, I found him. He is everything to me. And, life is not worth living without him. I have to see everyone else's children grow and reach milestones. But, not my child. I die inside more and more each day. 3 months after He left me. I could not take it. I failed and wound up in the psych ward for a month. That was in 2019. I am struggling to keep it together and continue to appear ""ok"". I know my biggest fear is that if I succeed I may never be reunited with him in heaven. But , it is almost worth it to not have to live without him. he is my baby. I also do not want anyone else to feel what I am feeling. But, most days, I just pray God will just be finished with me. I have been in a really bad place the last few days. I know I need help. But, I feel like I have no place to turn. I feel alone in pain and I am tired. Safe Haven",Suicidal
12030,"Had to put my dog down earlier tonight. I was already in a pretty big depression when she started getting sick and watching her slowly and painfully deteriorate just killed me. I finally let her go and it hurts so fucking bad. she is been my best friend for so long, we have slept in the same bed every night for almost twelve years, she was the first animal that was really mine. I have been responsible for taking care of her since I was like 7. I have felt so shitty the past couple months and I already felt so alone, but yknow at least I could come home and she would always be there. She was the one part of my daily routine I loved. Now that she is gone I just feel so empty and heavy and the weight of just how alone and meaningless my life is just keeps creeping up on me. I know I am not going to actually kill myself but I just wish I could be dead. All my problems would be solved if Iwasnt alive anymore. I am not even afraid of death I am only keeping myself alive out of guilt of not wanting to make my parents sad. I know I am grieving and it takes times but once the grief has passed Ill still just be exactly where I was before only without that tiny bit of joy and support that gave me some meaning. It just fucking sucks and I do not believe its going to get better. what is even the point",Suicidal

It just seems so... easy? So inviting? I think about it all the time -- like after the hard part -- which depending on how you do it, will be quick enough and after that it is just: eternal rest. It sounds so nice. Screw my family getting sad or something -- I will not even be there to grieve about the sadness I caused them because I am 6 feet under. Honestly, at this point I am so tired of keeping up with everything. I am tired of forcing myself to manage my emotions all the time. I forgot what it is like to *not* have to remind myself to keep a positive attitude. I forgot what it is like to actually .. have a purpose?

12039,"Living is extremely uncomfortable to me. it is troublesome and exhausting, and life feels more like a prison than a journey. I cannot leave here and just follow the fate I want. I was born condemned to events I never asked to experience, and doomed to awful feelings I never asked to feel. Friends or entertainments can ease my constant pain of being alive, but these things will never completely save me. Time stops, and suddenly, years go by, and there you are, stagnant, with no one to help or support you. Or at least that is what happens to me. I do not help myself and I never will, because at first I do not even deserve the ""blessing"" of life. My life will have no direction and no happiness. it is not worth working so hard if I already know my miserable fate. What I can do for now is anything mundane or banal to my life. Smoking, drinking, mutilating myself, getting sick. Whatever. Turns out I will not have a future, and if I do, I will simply embarrass my family, or I will be in a hospital bed recovering from a failed suicide attempt, or I will be alone, completely poor and depressed. I do not want to live anymore but at the same time I do not want to feel like a burden for the rest of my life. I want to try to commit suicide, but I will probably fail at that too. Sometimes I think nobody actually wants to die. Nobody wants to forever mark the story of everyone who went through their lives in such a morbid way. But there is not another way. Abandoned people just want to end the pain, they want to be at least reasonably happy, but what is the point of trying to be happy if I will never reach complete happiness... what is the point of trying to insist on living, if there is not and there will never be happiness in my story? Actually, I love life, or at least I used to love it... I love human beings. I want to be sweet, kind, joyful, I want to love and be loved. Deep down I love life. But life does not love me back. And now I hate it. Then I live with unilateral loves. I mean all kinds of love. And I managed to fail in all kinds of loves I have known in my life. It hurts a lot to have to live without a will. I do not want living to be an obligation anymore. No one cares about my existence and I will never have any meaning to anyone, I do not and will never mean anything. I at least wanted someone to actually love me and admire me for who I am. I am in a long process of acceptance, and in it I am trying to accept that I mean a lot less than I imagine. I am aware that I am absolutely nothing, but I need too accept it. And it is going to be painful to get over it. I have no value as a human being, and I will try to be strong enough to accept my reality, even if it costs me my own sanity.In the end, living really sucks more than I thought. I am a burden and my existence is meaningless",Suicidal
12041,"I have been depressed for the majority of my life. So much of my life was was either an uneventful blur or I was depressed or extremely depressed. I did however go through a stage in my life where I would say I experienced genuine happiness. I think about this time all of the time and have realized it only amounts to a few memories. I cherish these memories more than any other ones but it does make me sad that there is such a limited amount of them. It feels as though happy people create good memories all of the time, they seem to have so many that they forget a lot of them. It also makes me wonder if the total quantity of happiness really is important, I am just grateful to have experienced any at all. An analogy would be does it feel better to have won 10 championships or 3 in your life time? Probably the more the better. I am still grateful that I have been able to experience happiness at all in my life, even if short lived. Now I am just depressed like I normally am. I only have a few memories in my life of being truly happy",Depression
12049,"I have not ever told anyone everything and I am not exactly sure what this is even for, whether I just want know someone to cares, or maybe I just want someone to know and remember me.it is been a dark couple of days and I keep thinking that I am just so tired of being alive and in pain. I do not think I ever really want to die, but I definitely do not want to keep on living if life is this.I guess I should start by saying that I am privileged, I have access to free healthcare with no limitations on mental health, I have a therapist that I click with and is wonderful, I have a job that I care about and a mother that loves me. And still I cannot find any desire to carry on.I was a medic in the Army, and I was and still really am not ready to deal with the reality of it. I made mistakes and I cannot shake off the what ifs, should haves and could haves. I always remember that I made mistakes, I called things good enough, I did not speak up for the casualty when I could and should have, and it led to the picture in my mind that I always come back to, telling our Air Force JTAC officer that I was sorry and there was nothing left I could do. Worst of all, it was just the congruence of so many small things that added together to create the situation, so that the situation crept up on me and I was not aware where everything was heading until it was too late. it is really the guilt and fear that gets to me.I am afraid of myself, my actions and my mistakes, especially the potential of causing unforeseeable, unpreventable catastrophic harm. I do not trust myself to do the right thing, or to do the good thing, so I try to put myself in a place where I will never have to do anything. I am so scared that I will harm or allow harm to come to people around me, so I have withdrawn, and slowly tried to fade out of everyone is lives. This way I cannot hurt them now and it will not hurt them as much when I finally do go through with it. But this also scares me, because the idea that no one outside of my family and maybe 2 friends would really care if I killed myself is terrifying.I am cognizant enough to know that killing myself is a selfish thing, something that will because harm, instead of good for the people around me. I know it will be unfair to my family, my friends, my therapist, my coworkers, but that voice that says I am a fundamentally bad, unlovable, broken burden can feel so definitive. I have told myself that since I am an organ donor, it would be better because I will be doing something positive to offset partially the negative, but I do not know if I fully buy into it yet.it is been over 9 years now that I have felt like this, I have run through the rest of my 20s and it has maybe only gotten worse, or at least it definitely has not gotten better. I am now 32 and I am so fucking lonely. In that time, I have tried to kill myself, gone through a 4 month PTSD recovery program, had a loving relationship destroyed by my idiocy and baggage and then tried to kill myself again. I just got out of the inpatient wing of a VA hospital a couple weeks ago, after I checked myself in from fear of what I would do to myself and now, 2 weeks later, I am on the edge again. I do not want to die, I find that I am still scared of doing the deed when it gets close, the harm and pain it would because some people, but I do not want to live anymore without the prospect of getting better and I am so, so tired of being alive, in pain and unable to connect with other people. I do not see a future where things get better, and I do not see a future where I can keep going indefinitely which is fucked because I know how good I have it compared to so many people. I have unlimited medical benefits, and the Veterans Administration has been good to me. I believe in my work, and I have a great job here at the VA Medical Center, helping other veterans. The idea that I do something meaningful or bring positive things in other people's lives keeps me going, but then the darkest ruminations come in, where I can see how I harm people, because pain and burden in a shitty, destructive way. When that belief in myself is gone, then the resentment comes, the anger and frustration of how my suicide would hurt loved ones, holding me back. it is the frustration at the idea of being trapped, feeling forced to live for them instead of doing what I really want.If you have made it this far, thank you and I am sorry for even posting this, for creating something that will invariably because and spread pain to other people. I know I should not just share the pain, because misery loves company, but I am also just so scared and lonely and afraid that I will die without anyone ever knowing or understanding. I guess I just want this off my chest",Suicidal

What is it that is so awful that is bothering me? there is a few but not enough. I am so discontented with life. Even when its alright its never alright.

Like I was kind of down 2 weeks ago, which was exacerbated by a gout flareup which took my ability to walk away for a week. At the end of that flare, just as I had gotten on meds to stabilize my uric acid levels so I could walk, I had a relapse on painkillers and messed up a shared bathroom, leading to leakage in the apartment below and to my imminent eviction from my place (as soon as possible by the end of the month). I am crossing my fingers that the woman whose upstairs area I was planning to move in at the last week of August let us me move in early, and I quickly put an end to my relapse and have an appointment for vivitrol next week (the relapse was at the end of a vivitrol cycle), but it is difficult not to get down on myself, especially as the prospect of homelessness quickly approaches and I only recently managed to free myself of that condition. I just feel like a fuck up, am afraid that I will keep facing this failure repeatedly. I am trying and will not give up anytime soon, but continue to remain frustrated by my continued accrual of consequences which keep adding stress. I do not know.

I never got along with my teachers, as I was a student who came to the college via intercollege transfer from another engineering college, they never paid attention to me or helped me in the subjects. At the final year seminar, they purposely cut short my internal marks in that seminar. I had enough of that, they had already caused enough hurdles to me in those 3 years I had been there. I decided to not pursue that course. My 4 years of my life has been wasted. I sat another 3 years doing nothing. I was already depressed about not being completing the engineering course.

I am seriously done with everything i have no energy pls i want to go away.i think i have exams next week. i went to school for maybe 4 or 5 days after the online classes ended but nothing went into my mind. i still have last month's homework left and i have not learnt anything from going to school in the past 2 months. i do not see the point in anything and i do not know what to do anymore. there is nothing left for me.if anyone could give me some ideas to find some motivation to do it, i would be very grateful everything is tiring",Suicidal

Every time I see them I have to act like it did not happen and everythings cool but I have been hyper sexual since. Questioning my sexuality and identity. My parents had an awful marriage and I witnessed it fall apart. Dad is a gambling addict and cheated on my mother. Had twins with this other woman and hid it from me for almost 18 years. Grew up around domestic violence, I was beaten as a child. My own mother punched me in the face once. My sister is schizophrenic because of all the trauma me and her have been through. We both were bullied at school and have had racist remarks and jokes said to us. Even been encouraged to end it. I was falsely accused of sexual harassment for a kiss on the cheek and now I have a reputation as an abuser even though I am not. I have been trying so hard for so long and nothing ever changes. No woman will ever love me for who I am and not what I provide. Nobody cares about my passion/art and its the only thing that brings me joy.

12114,"Hey there folk, friendly neighborhood rant here. cannot promise it will be reader-friendly in terms of like formatting or timeline, but I will try my best. That being said, here goes.&amp;#x200B;Okay so this whole thing starts when I was about 11, mormon, living in California, and my parents were getting divorced. My mother left me with my father, who was too depressed to even get out of bed, for 2 weeks. She comes back for my sister's wedding, and we move to Indiana. In Indiana, my mother and my other sister (s2) decide that they are going to ""co-parent"" me more or less. S2 is pretty much just unlikable in every way. She is the type of person to gaslight you into thinking you are not depressed (we will get to that). Then, after about a year or two in that living situation, the ""Strawberry Incident"" occurred. This is when S2's mother asked me if I felt like cutting some strawberries, and I replied that I did not. I was then forced to do muscle failure for a week straight. After that occurred, I began to realize that the family I have may not be the best for me. Fast forward to about a year later. My father moves out to live with S2. One day, I was getting back from a temple trip to Indy and I had a confrontation with S2. I told her how I felt and said I was not sorry. I then went to talk to my father and he called me a ""Selfish Cocksucker"". That one always stuck. Flash forward one more year, and I am in 8th grade. I am having trouble mentally and had planned my own offing. I was going to do it the night of a concert for my school band. A teacher ended up finding out and told my mom. She then turned it into me trying to actively harm her. I was then sent to a mental hospital wherein I was sexually assaulted by my roommates. When I get back, S2 tells me that I was not really depressed because she would have known. &amp;#x200B;\-INTERMISSION-Hey there here is a little break from the madness. I hope you are having a good day. Anyways, let us dive back in.\-END OF INTERMISSION-&amp;#x200B;After that, I have a pretty uneventful time up until about the end of my freshman year. I had ended up overdosing on my antidepressants and told my best friend, W. Me and W went into a stairwell and we called the crisis hotline, thinking it would be the last call I make. W and I had planned to sing ""Wonderwall"" in our school's talent show. I had ended up being hospitalized again before being able to preform with him. I still feel terrible. Later on, I was with my mother in a taco bell drive thru, and the only thing I remember her saying is ""Why should I care about you when you treat me the way you do."". After a few weeks, cue a family party. I was on an LGBT site that I used to frequent (I think it was a mightynetwork site, I do not really remember all that well.) and also doing my schoolwork. S2 looks over to see what I was doing, and I showed her my schoolwork. She got suspicious of me, and asked to see my iPad. I refused, not wanting her to find out I was a member of the LGBT. She then escalates it, and we end up outside. I tell her that she is an active contributor to my depression, and she says that I do not have it. The next parts are extremely hazy, but I do remember her pushing me to the ground. I still refuse to give her my iPad password, so she threatens to call the police. In retrospect, I still would have kept it from her. After that, my brother in law ends up getting it from me and looks through my profile, finding out that I was Abrosexual. He then laughs at me, and offers me a cigar and beer to ""cool off"". Fun stuff. So after those events, I just cry myself to sleep and that is that. W ends up moving to the next town's school for our sophomore year and beyond. I have a new confidant, D. D and I go to the school counselor together to try to fix my living situation, and I am eventually told to go to the office one day. My principal, thinking I was in a gay relationship with D, called me a ""sick bastard"", and changes mine and D's schedules, so that we no longer have classes together. Somewhere along that timeline, in my freshman year, my dad dies. I am forced into sitting in a hospice room, awake, with my dying father for 12 hours. Flash forward to now. Going into my senior year. I am scared of letting anything show to my mom and getting hospitalized and not being able to go on my germany trip next year. I just want to know what to do. Please. :,)",Depression
12115,"I hope this helps at least one person. Losing someone we love is (in my opinion) the worst pain a human being can feel. I could break my leg twice in one day, but eventually, it will heal and I will walk on by. But when the heart is broken, I am not sure if it ever truly heals. I think we simply grow used to the pain and allow it to make us tough. Not stronger, but tough. They say it gets easier day-by-day and that is not untrue, but it feels like they are shrinking an experience so raw and gut-wrenching into something as insignificant as a papercut. I think in many cases when we lose someone without actually losing them, it hurts more than if they were really gone. The pain is unbearable knowing they are somewhere living life, waking up every day and having coffee with someone else, and dreaming of their life without you. it is like staying in a hotel with paper-thin walls, rooming next to them when they are with the person they love and you are in the room next door. Standing on the bed, ear to the wall, alone. Sunshine does not feel the same when we are hurt. Instead of our skin soaking up the rays and allowing them to seep into our pores and giving us sun-kissed skin, they beat down on us and burn us until we are red. Fighting the pain can be just as hard as accepting it. Trying to pretend like everything is okay like we are not hurting so bad that sometimes we wish the sun would not rise in the morning. Wanting to stay in the dark because it is easier than watching something as beautiful as a sunrise leave you every night. But maybe this is a blessing, a sign from the universe that reminds us we are human. We feel pain because if we did not how could we ever know the true immense joy of love? The diving-headfirst-into-the-deep-dark-unknown-putting-our-faith-and-heart-in-the-hands-of-the-one-person-our-hearts-beat-for kind of love. The bitter truth is our hearts may never really be the same and we will walk away with scars. But we have to remember that one day we will wake up and our hearts will hurt less, we will go out for coffee by ourselves and not feel alone, we will dream about things other than what hurt us, we will meet people who love us, and we will experience things that make our hearts flutter. Because that is life. Eventually, the sunshine will not burn us and we will feel the warmth of its rays like a blanket over our shoulders, comforting us as we accept love and pain at the same time. And when the sky fades, a blaze of color will drop onto the horizon, then darkness will fall. And we will not wish for the darkness to stay forever anymore because we can find peace in knowing that the sun will always rise in the morning. just some thoughts",Suicidal
12116,"Hey, so I have been having a really rough couple of months, and I think I have messed up my life really badly. I had a lot of really good friends at my college and we were all super tight not. I was dating my girlfriend for about 9 months and over the last couple of months I really messed everything up. I have been continuously pushing her away in all types of ways such as: having little to no sex drive because I have had no ability to even think about that, I have been isolating myself and not communicating what I have been going through well, and I just have not wanted to go on dates. None of this is why she said she wanted to break up though, she wanted to break up because I have not been able to make myself talk to her or communicate while we are back from school. She said I have a lot I need to work on and that she does too.Anyway I agree with her and I know I should not be in a relationship right now but I love her so much and want to be with her so bad, so this is not a post where I want you guys to say we should not be together right now because I know this. I think we will eventually get back together if she can see I grew up. I do not want to work on myself for her to take me back but that would be a positive.I guess me making this post is to ask how have you guys been able to work on yourself and what are some methods I can use to improve my mental stability, and also how have you been able to refind yourself when you have no clue who you are anymore?

12118,"TL;DR: I feel like I caused my best friends death and my entire life crashed around me, now I do not want it anymore. I guess Ill just start from the beginning. Ill speed this up though because I do not want to take up too much of your time. In like 6th or 7th grade I made friends online playing overwatch with a dude, like really good friends. I never had a buddy I could talk to casually and safely about literally anything from after school until 4am. We used to have a joke where wed just tell each other do not be a bitch for advice. It was laughable, really it was, because we both knew each other would give real advice anyway. Those would end up being my most hated words ever.Back in April of this year, I had a decently healthy relationship with a gf I had for about 6 months, and got accepted into college and was graduating High School. My friend and I started FaceTiming and he started to drive. He told me he should stop and I told him to not be a bitch. We told each other jokes and laughed really hard. He turned to look at me for a brief moment, looked back at the road, and got in an accident. His head went through the windshield and he died instantly. I panicked, and I do not usually do that. I felt enormous guilt, I still do. What had happened I felt was my fault entirely. So much so that I promised that it would never happen again. I left my gf and all of my closest friends for their safety. That was the hardest decision of my life. They all tried to get me to stop but i did not listen. I played Minecraft with my now dead friends little brother, he must have been 7-8 years old. I have never heard a kid cry like that. I did not even have the balls to tell him what happened or that I was sorry for it. Flash forward to about a few weeks ago, I tried overdosing on pills. Obviously that did not work, I guess I am inept? But I visited my grandparents house, started going through some old stuff. I found my grandpas old pistol and held it up. It just seemed like the right thing to do. I could not do that either. I wussed out. I have tried drinking to forget or maybe honor my lost friend(s) but nothing works. I cannot sleep. I guess I am asking for help but honestly maybe I do not deserve it. I am sorry for writing so much, maybe I just needed to get this off my chest.

12122,"It hurts being friends with someone who is basically everything you wish you were and has basically everything you wish you had. it is like life just decides to be cruel and dangle a dream in front of you knowing that no matter what you will never be able to obtain what they were so easily born into with just sheer luck. It just eats me up inside and makes me feel like somehow they are my worst enemy but they are my friend and I adore them still.it is hard being dependent on them in more ways than just emotionally because it feels like if something were to ever happen to them or they just did not like you anymore then a part of you just dies. Sometimes it feels like without them life is not worth living. They do not like my dependency on them (understandable) and I also know they will move on with their lives and find someone that they value more than me. I do not even want their love but I just wish that I had someone for myself who put me before others.I am just so tired of being mentally ill.

I graduated late from high school (a few months back) due to my learning disability and everyone around me just expects me to know what the hell to do with my life. Since the pandemic all the avenues I previously had mapped out in my head for jobs have died, due to seeing how the industries I was interested in have been affected. Now I cannot make any decisions on if college is even worth it too because, I wanted to go to help me get out of my she will, and social anxiety but, due to having to wear masks and social distancing and most colleges opting for online courses- I do not see how my social skills will even improve or how the experience is worth it. My high school was online for the last two years I went- and I assumed college would be different. People are also pressuring me to get a job, but recently I have not been able to see the point in that either as I do not want to commit to another thing where I am surrounded by people who make me feel empty. Part of me kind of just wants to die. I have been killing time trying to figure out what to do, and every single time I try to talk to someone who might give me any advice- they brush me off and tell me that since I am an adult it is my responsibility to figure out what to do.

12125,"I have bipolar II, so depression was a huge part of my life for a long long time before diagnosis and treatment. I have had my own journey, just like we all have, but I do not need to dive into my experiences because what I need to talk about is my husband. we will call him Z.Z has a loving family, friends, a job that appreciates him and pays him well, stable housing, time to do things he enjoys, no financial stress, the list goes on of things going right for him. We do not have kids, just a dog, but he is finding it increasingly difficult to care for another living thing regardless. He says textbook depression things. He says it is hard to wake up in the morning, he cannot do ""basic tasks"" like put away dishes or feed himself, he does not find joy in his usual hobbies anymore, he has not had a good night of sleep in ages, he is miserable and does not know why. The brain fog, the emotional outbursts, the sobbing fits, the constant feeling of trying to keep your head above water. Of course I cannot know exactly what he is going through because that experience is his own, but I KNOW these feelings. We all do. it is soul crushing when it is day in, day out. I have thankfully found my way out of the pit of depression through therapy, a correct diagnosis, and medication. it is not a perfect solution by any means, but I always say I never saw myself growing old until I got on 200mg of lamotrigine. I have pushed pursuing a treatment plan on him but he has a huge stigma against medication. He also goes in and out of denial that he even has depression and anxiety at all. He has been diagnosed and tried citalopram for about two months before calling it quits, this was back in February 2020. he is also tried three different therapists and they just never clicked, this was 2018-present. he is just been left feeling like he wasted time, money, and effort for nothing. I am getting him started on therapy again, though. we are also planning to try Wellbutrin this time. But nothing's set up yet, I am still sending out emails trying to find him a doctor.I try so hard, I really do. I pick up the dishes he cannot, I do the paperwork and write the emails he cannot, I cook and I clean so that he still gets food in his tummy and sleeps in clean sheets. At this point I feel like he only does his 9-5 and I fill in all the other gaps, which do not get me wrong I am so proud of him for maintaining a 9-5! I could not do that when I was at my worst! Additionally, he can get downright emotionally abusive and manipulative, but I take it with a grain of salt. Like I said, I have been there and I cannot even think of all the relationships I ruined or the people I hurt without feeling sick to my stomach from the guilt. I was not my best self, and I know it. I know he does not want to feel this way. I know making me cry is never the goal. I try to catch him when he is stable or lucid to talk to him, because when he is depressed he feels so far away. This is a completely anonymous reddit account so I would be honest and say if he was a burden to me or that I was beginning to resent him. Not at all. I love him unconditionally, but it is killing me to see him in such a hole that I cannot help him out of no matter what I do. Really when I look back on it our whole relationship has been dictated by his depression. it is always been present, but always he had something tangible to blame. But as each tangible problem is overcome another always seems to follow, how suspicious. I see it so clearly, but he does not see it this way. Another textbook depression thing he says is that he is not depressed, he is just lazy and useless. Everyday I check up on him and he either says he is feeling bad or ""bleh."" In this interim without a therapist I try to talk to him and help him reframe his thinking. Nothing sticks for long. I feel so helpless. I feel so scared. I am 100% intent on growing old with him but he will not make it to old going on like this, because I know I could not have. I guess my question is are there any similar experiences out there? What is there to do when you are watching a loved one just get wrecked by depression? I have asked myself the question of what would I have wanted at my lowest, and even though I try to give him that it does not ease the pain. But still, I ask you, what do you need at your lowest? Maybe I can apply it to him. I thought since I have also gone through it that I would be better equipped to help my husband through his depressive lows...",Depression

12142,"Hey everyone. My girlfriend and i began dating about a year and half ago after meeting on tinder a few months prior. We were both each others first ever relationship. I was a senior in college, she was a junior at the time. Everything started off so well, to the point where we both felt like the stars aligned for us. We clicked almost instantly. I would come see her every weekend about an hour away at her college and she would do the same for me. We both looked forward to the fact that even tho we were long distance, we always had a date when we could meet. When we were not jn college, she lived about 5 hours away. that is when things got tough, but we always seemed to overcome every obstacle that faced us. Everything seemed right when we were together, almost like a fairytale. We talked about our future, the thinks we wanted to accomplish in life and everything in between. We opened up to eachother in ways we never have for anyone else. She eventually talked to me about how she is struggled with depression ever since freshman year of college. Over the past 4 months or so, i began to really see it. She never seemed happy anymore, she was about to graduate from college, along with other things such as finding a job and just moving on to a new chapter in her life. The things she used to enjoy, she no longer cared about. She opened up to me about how she feels like i deserve better and she cannot hell the way she treats me. she is come to the conclusion that if we ever broke up, i would realize how toxic she was and that i would find someone better than her easily. I have always assured her that I have never felt that way and she is everything I have ever wanted. she is just incapable of seeing it that way. Its clear that she does not love herself so its hard for her to love me back the way she thinks i deserve. Truth is id do anything for her and i want to do what is best for her to. We have not seen eachother in 2 months since she graduated but she plans on coming over next week. untill then we just decided to take a break. am i being foolish to believe that depression has taken her over to the point where she feels the way she does?

I never told her that i was in love with her.First of all, it was just because of lack of self confidence. When i was older, i realized where is relationship, there must be sex. And i cannot have sex because of my problem i mentioned.I had to cut all our connections and go on in my life.Once, there was girl and it seemed that she may like me or even love. I had to send her away, cut all our connections and go on in my life. I did this everytime with every woman i'v met because i was afraid that even with my look, friendship with girl could grown in something more serious.There was a time when i came to terms with it and i peacefuly lived on. But last couple years, it is killing me, I am crying almost every night, I am not smiling anymore and this loneliness is really painfull.I would like to have a person i could share my life with, enjoy moments of life together, smile and love each other. But i know i cannot fulfill women's desires. I'v always figured out all my problems, but this.. i just do not know what to do, how to fix this. that is reason why i will be forever alone and will slowly dying inside with emptiness in my life...

In the meantime I am preparing myself for a breakup, even if I have some faith in the outcome. I have fought hard to reassure him about continuing together, but he is still lost about what decision to make. Beyond this I am afraid of a lifetime where I will never know if he is truly okay.Even if for a day it is easy to think he is not for me, I go to sleep crying because I feel the thought is cruel. He has been nothing but loving from the start and we were happy together. Our families liked each other. I love his so much. A few months ago I found out he has been suicidal for a long time. He told me his dark thoughts and it broke my heart. He did not want to talk about it and was upset that the whole thing came up, because it triggered him. We rarely ever fought, but now he says he cannot trust me. Now I pray to God for the first time so he gathers strength to overcome his depression because there is nothing else I can do.He continues to love me and want this relationship, but fears it might do him more harm than good. I want to do anything I can to prove I am strong enough for this and that I can be his support. I am afraid of what happens to him if he gives this up, which I understand is arrogant. There is no way to claim I am what he needs. But we thought we were going to be married one day. I am scared he is pushing me away. Viewed optimistically, the end of the relationship could diminish potential triggers and give him the space to focus 100% on himself, his way. All of my friends say I need to look out for myself right now. But what on Earth could my strength be for other than him, when he was the first to make life beautiful for me. Because of him I overcame my own depression and became so strong. I think I would be okay, I just would hate to settle for someone else. There is no knowing why he is depressed and what stops him from trusting me. Maybe he has some secret, I would suspect about gender. I would be with him no matter what. Anyone with advice, it is very welcome! I want to be there for him so badly, I am just not sure what else to do but be patient, I have done everything I can. I have cleared up misunderstandings. And again, maybe a breakup is just what makes sense. But this came out of nowhere. I trust he will find his way even if without me.

The last dying shades of pink leave me in darkness as the night approaches.I am running away soon. From this. I cannot deal with everything that is happened in the past weeks. I am running from school. From my parents. From my dying extended family. From my misery. And I am not the reason I am running. I am not the initiator. None of what is hurting me is caused by my hands. I try to calm myself. But I cannot. So tomorrow, I run or the next day. Or maybe I will never amount to anything and never do it.Will someone force a way into this account while I am gone? Will they see the malignant sludge that is my profile? Will people care again if they see my name on the news? I cannot stand being alone anymore. it is terrible, but I yearn to be cared for.what is more valuable, me, or the idea of me?

Being born with social anxiety and all kinds of other mental health issues and have this whore of a woman constantly shove deep down your soul's throat how she hates living with the mom and dad you have loved so and describing every single day for the last 20 years how she would like to kill herself, every time differently?And when it is not that, she is begging to be taken away to her other son's house, whose bitch of a wife physically abuses her, but I guess that is better than living a comfortable life with my two parents who work hard to maintain a comfortable living for their fucked in the head adult son, their ADHD child and this is ungrateful sack of 87 year old shit who cannot see how good her life is and how much worse it would be with them, who could not care less about her and only use her pension from my dead grandfather for their own gain... My grandfather who was a great man and deserved no time with this leech.I know, she is the terrible person, right? However through all these years of being constantly assaulted with suicide threats and negativity, at 15 it became pretty clear that I was depressed. My anxiety still feels like being stuck in the fiery pits of hell, and her being a fundamentalist religious shithead kept filling my young child brain with the idea of eternal pain and damnation in hell, even if she is the one who constantly threatens to end her own life. I am still religious, I love the teaching of Jesus, my prophet, and I respect all other beliefs just the same, all I wish and hope for this planet is peace and harmony... But the image of hell this 1930s hag implanted into my hear is just too much, I cannot take it. I do freelance, it is a nice way to work until I get my workshop with my best friend to fix electronics, build PCs and sell the occasional tech. But sometimes I cannot even get out of bed because of the existential dread, thinking so much about how one day I will die and from what she is told me... I might go to hell. I do not necessarily believe it, have your faith or lack thereof but I know my God would not throw me into the fiery pits of hell because some asshole grandmother set my mind into this state.When I can get out of bed, I waste my monthly earning on vodka and cigarettes and walk till the end of town, until there is nothing but grass, dirt roads and the sea to east. it is less worse than death, that is for sure, but for how long will it satisfy me?I hate myself and her whilst loving all others, so I am deeply sorry for anyone of you who might have read this, I did not mean to take your time.I do not want to die, but there are no other viable options right now to escape from this hell on Earth. My father refuses to try and get medical intervention or doing anything about it.What is worse? Living a hell on Earth or testing my luck with God?Something, someone, save me.And these issues are only the least of my worries.6 years of psychiatric appointments and visits to the psychologist, but in the snap of a finger, destiny decided to take it all away from me again.

I have become so numb to everything that it hurts to think about how much I have changed..I tend to keep myself from relationships due to my emotional unavailability from depression because I will know that anyone I date will just feel ignored. I do not want to hurt anyone and do genuinely care about people, even if they do not care about me.I am terrible at explaining my emotions and I apologize ahead of time if this sounds jumbled and repetitive. When I was 10 I was raped. As a male I was pretty much ignored because my attacker was female and it sucked. Losing 2 loved ones to cancer, my dad had a stroke, and my mom was unavailable because she had to take care of my father. When I finally told my parents they supported me fully and took very good care of me to get mental health support. My life has been pretty much existing day to day. Not living, just existing. I feel completely numb and have spent most of my days begging to God for something to change, pleading that my life will be better but it has not. I have tried several coping skills for depression but they always seem to be temporary and never last no matter how long I use them.Over the years I have been officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, PTSD and ADHD. All of which culminate into a bundle of nerves and depression that desperately wishes for the touch of others yet is too scared to let anyone near him or get to know him. My friends that do genuinely know me and care for me have stuck with me for years and I have never been more grateful for anything in my life.My sister is my best friend and she has helped me through so many issues that I could never repay her for. I feel guilty for venting to her sometimes though because she has her own issues and she does not need more to add to her pile.Most of my day is spent sleeping, eating, and reading or playing video games on the occasion where I feel even remotely alive enough to do so.I have never self harmed or attempted suicide and never plan on it for the sake of my family and friends but that does not mean I do not wish I did not exist sometimes. I hate myself for what I have become and worry every single day that I will become nothing and end up somehow more worthless than I already am. I know I am intelligent (please do not think I am bragging I promise you I am not), and that is the worst part. I know I have potential, but I am so downtrodden and depressed that I have no motivation or drive to accomplish anything. My love for history and geography is something that I cling to, because I do not have much left.So here I am, here is all that I am, and I do not know what I am doing anymore.

I finally got treatment at 18, and I am starting my ninth antidepressant since then (Viibryd) tomorrow morning. I have been deluding myself for the past 8 months; I increased Wellbutrin this year and it helped some, but it seriously amplified my anxiety, which I have been trying to treat since then. But I had my psych appt yesterday and we discussed tricyclics or Viibryd, and I went with the latter because I would heard good things about it for TRD, and especially TRD with anhedonia. Despite the bad side effects. My pharmacy had to order it and I picked it up tonight, but since yesterday I have been reading and panicking.&amp;#x200B;I had a lot of hope yesterday; I imagined a life where I actually wanted to do something.

I hate the 9 meds and still daily suicidal/self harm thoughts. I hate that I cannot get a MAOI. I hate how hard it can be to treat depression. I am just so defeated and angry at this point.

Due to this I constantly have to worry about being employed or else Ill be the reason were homeless.

I always thought once I ditched the shithole that was high school, Id have a fresh start in college. As you can tell, not true for me. I had the worst breakdowns, falling out with a very close friend and I was sexually harassed by my professor my first semester after he found out I was vulnerable. I bombed my first two semesters of school and I am so scared to tell anyone that I am such a failure. I am a first generation student. I am supposed to be the one in my family that becomes something but I have achieved absolutely nothing. I have just been an imposter acting like I am worth anything.

Not one person to even so much as talk to. This is not a post looking for anything. Just to vent.I am reaching my limit. The only thing I am capable of doing is laying in bed and drinking/getting high. I cannot even watch tv or movies because nothing interests me. I have one show I watch and I am sick of it.Scrolling reddit makes me feel like complete shit about myself. Everybody is good at something and I cannot even try anymore because my families abuse has made me feel so worthless and shitty about myself I cannot even put it into words. I feel mentally paralyzed and crippled. I cannot even bare to face or talk to anybody I feel so worthless and ashamed of my existence. Is this really what I deserve? The worst part is as badly as I want to die and hurt myself I cannot because I am a coward and pussy and the only method I can see not being scared of is impossible right now because I do not have access to opiates or benzos anymore so Ill continue to sit here and suffer until I can finally get my hands on what I need.

12241,The men in my family are known to have dreams or epiphanies (as best as i can describe it) of the future that most of the time come true and i am not excluded from that. It can vary from how a particular day turns out to if your girlfriend is going to be unfaithful. Usually the vision will come before the signs that something will happen do. I have been having a recurring dream of my eventual suicide. I can see the path the bullet will take through my brain and it used to not bother me i was completely ok with it. I embraced it even because knowing i would not live long anyway made everything so much easier. I had another wave of calm the other day and i knew then that this was the final stop. I can either continue working my dead end job living at home with no friends anymore and kill myself in six months time or i could hang on to the last bit of hope that maybe i can turn myself around. I got up and decided fuck it I am already dead inside what more could hurt me and i trimmed my beard and brushed my teeth. Yesterday i cleaned my room (kind of) and today i actually got to work on time. Today i applied for another job and I am trying to do at least one little thing of self care every day. Maybe one day ill climb out of this void. Funny thing is the main thing that bothered me about seeing my gravesite in a daydream is that they put a headstone and I have specifically requested that i be wrapped in a cotton sheet and a cedar tree planted at my head i do not want my body preserved. I could even see the date on it but no cedar tree more important. TLDR; maybe I am not ok with suicide I know how I am (hopefully) not going to die,Depression

And honestly most of it is because I feel lonely. I have maybe a few friends I talk to sometimes. But for some reason none of that is satisfying this yearning. I did recently end a FWB situation I had going on. I guess the FWB situation helped me depression wise. But I am so, so sick of relying on these type of things to cure this depression. I am tired of chasing people just to not be alone. I am tired of settling for sex even though PIV does not do sh*t for me and all I really crave is the physical intimacy that comes with it. And I am tired of having these things eventually turn to sh*t and looking for more of these type of connections. It sucks. And now I feel like just hitting this dude up and asking for sex even though hes the worse lay but the physical intimacy was enough. And its not just sexual relationships, its friendships too. I do not connect with most of my friends. More so, they rarely excite me. When I am with them, my head is elsewhere. I am literally never paying attention to the conversations I have with them, I am just blanked out. But I continue to hang with them just to escape that lonely feeling.

Every day, I wake up from a (usually terrible) dream at 1-2pm and feel tired even though I have gotten 9-10 hours of sleep. I try everything, from meditation to daily exercise to journaling - but I always feel the same emptiness/loneliness whenever I am alone, especially at night. that is why I always end up sleeping past 3am because I cannot get myself to relax until then. I always get these intrusive thoughts of embarrassment from my past, and a ton of bad flashbacks. I rarely think back to good memories. I try to push myself to be productive every day but I feel more and more lethargic and fatigued every day. I go to the gym 5-6x a week and eat plenty of food (2500+ calories) but I always end up feeling a lack of energy (even with caffeine) and cannot focus on my goals. I also drink plenty of water. And worst of all, I feel like my memory has worsened to the point where I constantly forget the names of acquaintances, misplace my belongings, and my entire childhood has become a blur (my mother was an abusive narc for most of my life - which I believe contributed to this).Honestly, it feels like I self-sabotage myself so often. I get thrown back into hours upon hours on Youtube/Social Media to get that dopamine high that I usually never get otherwise. I try to stop but I always get sent back into a loop the next day.

And then I get extremely upset about it all because I miss those days- I never had any responsibility, I never had to worry about whether or not the next day I am going to be okay and I never had this deep rooted fear of getting old- of becoming a grumpy old man who people would not want to be around. I used to wake up early, and watch cartoons and be excited because the whole day was ahead of me.

I used to be super excited about being around people, got a little shy sometimes, but now I have a fear of talking to people- what if I mess up and cannot fix anything? What if they hate me? What if they look at me and only pity me? These are the thoughts that go through my mind- I wall myself off out of a lack of trust and actual fear of other people.

When I got there he went over all my medications with me and he actually also specializes in psychiatry. So instead of a quick visit about something minor, he ended up talking to me about my mental health for 2 hours and having me fill out a bunch of questionnaires. I did not expect to have to talk about my mental health at all with him, so I got super overwhelmed with all of it. He seems super genuine and really interested in helping make sure I am on the right medications and whatnot. He said we would go over all my answers in a follow up appointment next week.But because I was so anxious and emotional over it all, I lied on the questionnaires about some things (severity of my depression, some diet issues I have had, etc) and I feel like shit about it. I know that by lying about that stuff I am not doing myself any favors, especially when this doctor seems to actually want to help me out.Would it be weird to call and be honest about lying and ask if I can fill them out again?

I still suffer with it but its become easier to cope with. I have looked at all the peoples socials of whom I was friends with at the first sort of few days when I felt depression, and did not think much of what I felt. When I look at those socials, I think, those people have become strangers to me. Those once friendly faces have become the strangers that you walk past awkwardly and smile at. Those people that I once stopped from ending their life, have stopped the daily text, funny image, call, because they have met new friends that were emotionally available to give that excitement and care and I just was not capable of doing that. And now I have lost touch with some of the best friends I had and I have to walk past them with those thoughts flooding into my head.Just think, if I was not the way I was, I might still have those friends. Those friends might have saved me from a few of those killer nights where my mind would be numb from the entire planet- but I was not man enough to start the conversation about it. It makes me feel that I have just neglected everything around me. I mean heck, I almost lost my girlfriend because I was so anxious that Id crack under the pressure of the simple how are you?. I was so emotionally unavailable i was considering cutting it off for her sake- but I realised I loved her too much to do so. So I took action. I turned off socials notifications, I stopped checking my phone, asking to meet up with friends, and focusing on things I was capable of focusing on; my studies and my girlfriend. It sounds horrible, saying my gf came before the bros but the bros were already building bridges with other guys so I already felt like a scapegoat then.

And now I am here, with my girlfriend (who I am grateful for and love) and my studies. I do not have a single friend I can possibly say backs me, checks up on me, calls me when they realise I am suffering at my worst, and its just made me use the tactic of shutting down from the world while i sort my self out.

Later after I finished school I was just a mental wreck with absolutly no social skills. I dident realy know what to do so I did a BVB that is something like a bridge year to get you ready to learn a job. Around that time a lot of things cleared up in my mind. I aknowledegd that I am trans but still dident do mutch about it beciuse I know that my family would hate me even more and I should wait till i can move out. I lost around 20kg ( I was obese) and actually had social interaction in the BVB i actually made friends i guess. Then the second wafe of corona hit and the BVB stopped vor over six months and we just got some stuff to do per E-Mail. I was stuck at home whit my Family that i do not talk with and I lost contact with the persons I met. I sunk into a deep depression and the Dysphoria ( Stuff that i hate about myself becouse of gender related stuff) just got whorse and I just wanted to end my stupid useless live. I dident self harm myself I wanted to die whitout pain. I dident have acess to medication so I just wanted to cutt my wrist and blead out.... Sometimes I sat there houres whit a fucking kitchen knive in my hand but diden had the guts to just do it. I do not know if its good or bad that I dident do it. My existance just sucked. I kind of opend up about my mum that live is hell for me and i asked her if i could see a terapist, surprisingly she was okay with that. I got to a terapist and kind of tould her everything... Becouse I tould her that i was suecidial i got put into a psychosomatic facility that I stayd for two months. They kind of saved my live in a view ways to be honest. It was the first time in my live that everything seems to be okay. I turned 18 during my stay there. I am now kind of mentaly stable again. They helped ne to get back in kontakt whit my dad. (My parents divorced when I was 3.) and I moved to him directly after I got relesed. That was two weeks ago. My family cut contact with me becouse I moved to there ""enemy"" and I do not realy care tbh.

12305,"Several months ago I went through a terrible breakup of a 4-1/2 year relationship. I lost the person that knew more about me than anyone - including my parents. I had to move back in with them, and it was rough. For a few months we tried taking a ""break,"" where I was not allowed to contact her unless it was something we both planned. Right off the bat, she told me that she just wanted to break up but was also curious to see where things went.&amp;#x200B;After two months of listening to all of the fun she was having without me, and her starting to find excuses to back out of everything, I decided it was time to end it. Regretfully it was over the phone, but I do not know if I had a choice because she would agree to meet and back out at the last minute.&amp;#x200B;I was suicidal for a long time after that. Like not eating for several days at a time, looking for any websites with information about how to commit suicide, and even going places to get supplies. I lost about 20 lbs in just over a month because of this. I constantly reminded myself of everything that my ex told me was wrong with me and every mistake I made in the relationship. This was the person who knew me the best, and they thought so terribly of me, so I took it to mean that was who I am.&amp;#x200B;I started going on long, aimless drive to get out and try to find something. Several times I ended up in the city my ex and I had lived in. Our lease did not end for another month, so I stopped by the apartment once after she said she had moved. My head was thinking of all the good memories I had with her there and told me to go, so I did. But actually being there was completely different. She still had random items all over the apartment, and she still had a few of her collages there, but all of my pictures were removed. A letter that I wrote to her shortly after the breakup was laying in a pile of junk mail on the couch.&amp;#x200B;After seeing all of this, I made my first suicide attempt. I tried hanging myself, but I stopped because that shit's uncomfortable. I tried calling a few friends, but they were busy and could not talk. I did not know what to do, so I just drove back to my parent's and locked myself in my room.&amp;#x200B;I decided I might as well do everything that I can to find something in life, so I started traveling. I did a family vacation that went terribly because everything's uncomfortable around my parents now. I visited a few friends, and that was a really good time. I honestly felt great for the first time in a long while.&amp;#x200B;After about a month of that, I found a new apartment in the city where my ex and I lived because I am still going to school there. It was really difficult at first to be here and see all of the places we would go just a few months ago, but that slowly wore off and now it is just mildly difficult. First week I am here, I see my ex pulling into the same parking lot that I am leaving. I decide to go visit a friend to get out of town, and end up running into her mom. Then, two weeks later, I saw her going out with the guy that she said was just a school friend.&amp;#x200B;I was feeling great and not thinking much about suicide, but now it is starting to come back. I have thought about it almost everyday this week. I think about jumping into traffic when I am on a walk, driving my car into the river on my way home, giving myself alcohol poisoning, or just starving myself. But I just do not know anymore. I feel like I have this drive to just keep going and meet someone else and live a dream life, but at the same time I know I am not hard working, smart, or wealthy enough to get any of those dreams. I feel like it would create too much drama, too.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading this. I am sorry for how long and rambling it is; I just needed to vent. I do not know what to do anymore",Suicidal
12308,"Things have already been shitty for the past few months. I tried to keep my friendship with someone who I felt like I was growing apart from, but then kept getting all clingy and annoying (because I was afraid I was losing him). Well a couple nights ago I decided to clarify something through text. The next morning (yesterday) he only said one thing to me but did not say anything to me for the rest of the day. Today he did not say a word to me. So I guess I lost him. I am just so sad and upset because I miss our friendship. I miss it so much and now its gone. On the bright side I at least have my other coworker who I have been chilling with on the tailgate of his truck during our breaks. We talk about random shit and I just feel so much better, until I get back inside. Were both down about work so we just go outside and vent until we have to go back inside. I am always looking forward to it. I know there will be some days where well have different breaks and one day when were both going to be gone, so I am just enjoying it while it lasts because it seems like every good thing gets taken away from me. But on top of my depression, I decided it would be cool to hurt myself even more and see what my hs crush is up to. It seems as though hes been getting serious with someone and I am happy for him but my hormones have been out of control (my insurance does not cover my birth control anymore, and I use it to regulate my periods, so its been fucking me up) so I am extremely sensitive to EVERYTHING. My crush is not even my main focus right now. He always is and that is what occupies my mind lol but I saw something innocent that made my stomach sink and it was not even that serious. Here is the [link]( that summarizes it for reference. I also mentioned that I am considering seeing a therapist. I have been looking on and off because my insurance is shit and most of them do not even take my insurance. I am planning on maybe hiking myself this weekend and going to an amusement park with my friend next weekend. I know I need to get out there I feel better when I do. Work depresses me and it does not help when someone you needed the most is not there for you. Again, I have my other coworker who I can count on. He always cheers me up. But I am just sad every time I go to work and see coworker 1. I really miss our friendship. Blah",Depression
12309,"Original comment was in French. Shitty translation by me.The problem would first come from people that would be manipulated, and that would go kill themselves because of the pressure coming from an evil-minded entourage. Then, things always end up getting better, and a suicidal person by definition cannot realise that, giving an easy way for someone to kill themselves would necessarily increase suicide rates. Suicide is not a right, it is a selfish act whose consequences are dramatic for the victim's entire entourage, but not for the victim themselves. I have never heard about a suicide that would have made anyone happy, even for the victim, woe will always be better than nothingness.Woe will always be better than nothingness. I cannot explain how those words are straight up cruel. People want you to suffer rather than not existing. Those words are going to stick with me for the longest time. An unwelcome haunting.This is a sick world we live in. I wonder what impact this piece of shit was thinking his bullshit would have on me and other suicidal people. How can you tell that to someone suffering? How insane, how cruel do you have to be?Who are truly the selfish ones? WHO THE FUCK ARE THEY?But this is only a reflection, a foretaste of our entire society. I could never again bring myself to believe, even one second, in anyone's goodwill. Humanity is devoid of such thing. It is only cold and hostile. This is something someone replied to me as I was ranting about how suicide should be a right. This is why we can never talk about our struggles. This is why we can only withdraw into ourselves and die in a hidden corner, like agonising cats.",Suicidal
12314,"i fantasize about it constantly. i can feel it in my fingers and belly and chest, how badly i want to do it. i have destroyed my own life. i am a tyrant and monster in the lives of others. i feel no connection to anyone or anything. i just autopilot through life, get flat on my ass drunk every night and take sleeping meds to knock myself out after i get home from my useless job. i hate my husband and he hates me. every therapist I have seen says they cannot help me, that i need to go to inpatient care. but i cannot go to fucking inpatient care again because i have to keep working my piece of shit job to pay my half of the mortgage on my fucking house so that i have somewhere warm to drink myself to death. my husband cannot afford it without me and we just bought it so we cannot sell our way out of it. so even though it might not be today, i know that someday i will die by suicide and i cannot fucking wait for that day to come. i know ill die by suicide, even if not today",Suicidal
12316,"This is my first ever time on reddit and I think I am making this just because I want to vent. I want someone, anyone, to know how badly I am hurting. I am 26/F, single, unattractive, obese, absolutely 0 friends and I live at home with my parents. I basically exist to clean up after my family and their 6 dogs. I dropped out of highschool at 16 (2011) after we moved from one state to another. I developed crippling anxiety from having to start a new highschool after growing up all my life in one town with the same kids. I would leave class to cry in the bathroom, and eventually I just could not even make it to the school without breaking down. I started feeling suicidal in 2012. I feel like I am stunted emotionally/mentally if that makes sense? I forget how old I am, I still feel like I am a teenager sometimes and then I get hit with reality. I am going to be 30 soon. I have had a few jobs but mostly I am holed up in my room, for 10 years its been this way. I ran away with an older man at 18 as well which was extremely traumatizing. Looking back I realize how creepy it was that he pursued me at his age, and basically coerced me into leaving with him. Of course I made my own decision but I was also untreated for my mental illness and I was so young so I feel like he knew he could easily get me to do what he wanted.So I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 10 years but in recent months its gotten worse. During bad episodes of depression I will hit myself in the arms and I have started cutting my legs with some scissors. The urge to harm myself is so overwhelming, its difficult to explain. I do not know why but the marks left behind by the cuts are more comforting than punching myself and leaving nothing to show for my pain. I have a psychiatrist who gives me meds for anxiety, which I am grateful for because they did help for a while, but I have not told her about my severe depression, self harm, or suicidal thoughts. I know she will suggest therapy but I have never ever told anyone any of this that I am typing now. The thought of sitting down and spilling my guts to someone is really intimidating and I do not know if I am ready to do that. I am part of a traditional community (and I will leave it at that), and it is been my dream to fall in love, start a family and just live a simple life with a loving husband. But I have come to realize that I will never be the type of woman that these men want. I am trying to lose weight but my skin will still be saggy and marked from my obesity. I have dental issues I am insecure about and want to fix. Of course there is my mental health that is a huge burden on my own life, but the biggest hindrance is my age. In this particular community, men make it very clear that 30 yr old women are basically unwanted, at worst, entirely worthless. Like as soon as we turn 30 we turn into prince phillip or something. Even 30yo men are looking for 20 yr olds to marry so they can have as many children as possible. The last guy I was speaking to kept saying that I ""only have few more years to bear children"". Even if I lose weight, fix my smile, all that, I will still be ""getting old"". Maybe all of these things sound trivial but i genuinely feel like I am disgusting and worthless and there is no hope for me. I even left my social media because it was so heartbreaking to see these beautiful young women getting married and starting families and basically living the life I dream of but will probably never see. I guess I am jealous, but not in a mean way. I am genuinely happy for all of these ladies, I just could not bear to see it anymore. I felt like it was making my depression worse.I have a faith but I have not been practicing or even thinking of God at all. I have a potential job lined up for me but it does not make me feel better. I will have money but I do not really care about it or material items. there is nothing I really want to do, or anything I want that money could buy. I have no plans except make it day to day. just another suicidal person",Suicidal

I finally turned my life around a commissioned in the army which is where my life got even worse. I ended up meeting a girl and moving here to fort hood with her son to live in my new house. She fucked my entire life up and caused me to commit a felony involving prostitution. This has lead to me getting separated from the army. I lost all my friends, I am broke and in massive debt.

12331,"I thought if I did something right Ill be okay. I am the only one to go to college in my family and I went for art. I love art. Since day one. I probably applied to at least 150 professional jobs since graduating. A friend applied with me, she went to USC. she will get calls back, i would not. I went to a state school. I quickly realized how professional art jobs are classist exclusive clubs that no one like me can ever get into. Okay, I gave up and moved on to something else I really want to do that will make me happier. Tattooing. Denial after denial of finding an apprenticeship, I have come to the conclusion that I am a bad artist and people who follow me just pity me. Its real cute I keep trying. I am so tired of condescending talks from people because I am a small quiet black girl they think I am as dumb as a brick wall. They do not even bother to remember my name. Ill go somewhere with my white boyfriend once, and they will remember his and they will not even look at me. Its humiliating. I do not have any friends. I cannot even get a full time job fucking being a Walmart greeter if I tried. I see millennials my age in the luxury apartment buildings my bfs parents live in and I want to shoot myself because I cannot afford to live in a shack. My best friend from college killed herself in 2019 and I understand the toll it takes on her loved ones. Her mom sold her businesss bc she could not even walk into it anymore. Still I feel like I was born to do this to myself. God said let us make her female, black and with a deadbeat dad who got my tattooed named covered up, crippling anxiety that has given her medical debt she cannot pay off, and 5 years wasted for a degree she cannot use.

12337,"I am 13 and I have done some really bad things in my life and all this guilt is so suffocating, I do not know what to do, after that horrible decision I made back in April, I cannot stop thinking about how much I deserve to die. I wish I could have been normal, I wish i did normal things. To start at the beginning, I was around 8 maybe younger. I would always hang out with a kid in my neighborhood and they taught me about things like porn and I definitely should not have learnt at that age but since than until like June, I used to be obsessed about watching that stuff and I would watch different kinds, I do not think I need to explain anymore. But I guess watching about one type influenced me and I got curious so I did something absolutely disgusting, I made my dog lick me in the inappropriate place and that happened once more but that is all, I never did it again because I knew it was bad and I felt so ashamed and disgusted with myself. When I was 11 I did try to attempt something like that, and I forgive myself for that because it did not actually happen unlike it did back in April, I cannot forgive myself for this. I am so disgusting. Even though I did other horrible things, this might be the wrost and I cannot forgive myself. I do not deserve to be loved or even be happy. So many good things are happening in my life and I do not deserve any of it, I deserve to die in the most painful way. Everyone would be so disappointed in me and now I am even more scared about what will happen in the afterlife for me if there is one. If I am being honest, I just want to stab myself like millions of times out of hatred and disgust. All I am is a disgusting rapist. I have no reason to live anymore, I should have lived my life better. I am a horrible and a disgusting person.",Suicidal
12338,"I have had severe depression in the past and I am currently on antidepressants too.

12344,"I have been talking to this girl for 4 months. (She was abused by a narcissist in her last relationship so were taking things slow as you can see.) So far we have been great, our feelings were mutual, we talked all the time on the phone, we laughed, it was a good time. But the past few weeks, she is expressed that she is been mentally exhausted, and she feels overwhelmed with everything. I noticed a change in our communication. She barely calls anymore, our texting is dry, and she leaves me on read for hours sometimes. I have asked her about this, and she is assured me that is has nothing to do with me, and that she still likes me very much, but she just feels overwhelmed and tired. She suggested that she might have depression yesterday, but she is not sure because she is never had it Or dealt with it. I deal with anxiety which causes me to overthink things a lot. So this situation has been taking its toll on both of us. I hate making this about me, because if she is dealing with depression, I want her to focus on herself and her mental health so she can get better. But when I am talking to her, its draining. Because I am trying to be my happy funny self, trying to make her laugh and feel somewhat better, but all I get is crumbs back. And that makes my anxiety go into overdrive with thoughts like she does not like me or she is lost interest and even though she is expressed that that is not the case, due to my anxiety, I cannot help but to think like that and I hate that I do because that is the last thing she needs if she is really going through depression. I want to help her through this and I want to stop feeling this way, but I do not know what to do. I have suggested therapy, but she said its too expensive and she wants to hold off on it for now. I do not know what to do.TLDR: Girl I am talking to thinks she is depressed and our communication has drastically changed due to that. What can I do to help her and how can I stop feeling like she does not like me because of it? The girl I have been talking to thinks she has depression and I am not sure what I can do.",Depression

We had an emotional and romantic interest in each other. I know up until he stopped replying he was still making those feelings known.

Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out. I still do not know how I will get through the next 4 weeks but I will manage somehow because she is worth it to me... we have been really good friends on a deep level for years and our relationship just started in February of this year. At the start of this year everything was going so well. I was out of therapy and started a new career path in IT and then ""we"" happened. And now it feels like everything is falling apart. I just hope I will have the strength to carry on. Because at the moment that is the only thing left for me to do. Again I do not know why I am posting this here.

12351,"I work at a ice cream kiosk, and fuck me.I keep doing things wrong,Today the ice cream machine had some yellow stuff growing inside and had to be emptied and cleaned and I did not know what to do even though I have seen it done before, and the boss shouted at us again and it is sucks.I cannot focus, it is soo hot inside there and my mind feels like it is being fried, we do not get breaks even though I work 7.5 hours 5 times a week and I only get to drink a bottle of water during the day.What sucks is that a lot of the time I am too slow at closing because I have to clean and get everything in order for the next day and I also need to serve costumers too, it especially sucks when they order a milkshake, because I have to thoroughly clean it all over again so it does not stink the next day.I need to empty the dirty water under the sink, wash the floor, wash the counters, check and fill what is missing, get shouted at, see what we do not have and is needed more of and write it down.I cannot work overtime all the time, the owner does not have that kind of money for thing's that has been broken and need to be repaired.When I first started everything went fine and I actually was applauded on doing good, but now I feel like I have to keep doing good and better, but my mental health has taken a beating recently and I am falling into old habits of suicidal ideation, I feel so hopeless and I am terrifed of being fired, I keep waking up at 5 am and cannot fall asleep until 2 am or later.I take every criticism and failure to heart, I need to be as perfect as humanly possible, because if you are not you get scolded or fired and shit, it is a start up business, so it might even fail because of bad employees like me.I have always wanted to function like a good person, but I do not know if I can, or if I even want to anymore, I want to punch the fucking wall and shout my lungs out.

12353,"My father killed himself when I was only 4yo, that was 36 years ago. I ended up having a rough childhood, my mother did not have a stable job. The parents of my father abandon me and my mother. Luckily the family from my mother's side were there, we managed. Living in a remote village helped I suppose.So economically my father's suicide was kind of crap.Through all my childhood the thing I hated the most was at the beginning of the school year when teachers would hand over questionnaires or would ask in the class ""what do you parents so?"". When it was out loud I would get really sad. I remember being so ashamed when I would answer ""my father is no longer alive"" and then the teacher would ask ""what did he die of?"", I would always lie about it.I always knew that he had killed himself. I remember going to the place where he poisoned himself and seeing the paramedics taking him into the ambulance. In the village there was a house that on the ground floor had a pub, on the outside it had stairs going up to the first floor, he just went to the pub ordered his last glass of wine came outside and sat on the steps halfway up the stairs, and drank the poison, a strong insecticide used in farming, straight from the bottle.Some years later after completing primary school I went to middle school, to get to school I would need to get a bus. To get to that bus I would walk about 1.5km (1mile) each way every day. Now the fate of destine, the bus stop. That bus stop was a meter way from those stairs, so basically every day during 4 years I would walk to and from the exact place where I saw my father for the last time.To go to high school I would still need to walk to get a bus, but that one was about 4km in the opposite direction, there were lucky days when I would get a ride from someone. I endured all that cold and walks in the dark, most of the 4km had no public lights so the winters were tough. Being really poor, my clothes were always whatever people would give to my mother, I even got a big bag of clothes from my first English teacher in mid school. I endured all that because I knew that life was shit, but if I just stuck in school things would get better. Always had good grades, I never had to study much, things always kind of make sense, and things like geography and literature... well those just sucked, I did not see the point of learning something that was basically either memorize lots of simply assumptions of whatever writer was thinking hundreds of years back - totally pointless to me.Although I had never had my own computer, I self taught what I could from either computer magazines or from the only programming book available in the school library (an old book on Pascal programming language). Back in the day, access to a one of the four computers in the school library had to be booked in advance. While my colleagues would spend their time on mIRC, I would try to learn whatever I could. One day I was sitting there, just waiting for my turn and I realized that some teachers would also use those computers, I started to wonder what would the teachers use the computer for. So in my allocated time I started writing a tiny computer virus, not really a virus as it would not replicate itself, anyways a spyware that would simply create a copy of every document and spreadsheet opened in those 4 computers, this was around the end of the last year of my secondary school. And yes, some teachers were writing the exams there. oh! now, I remember I never deleted the little spyware.Anyways, the point is, despite the hard times I always had good grades. When I finished the secondary school, I voluntarily joined the army, well because I wanted to go. And incredibly those same questions would pop up, ""what does your father do?"" ""what did he die of?""... same feelings, sadness and extreme shame of how my father died.Finished my time in the army, got out and got a job, and then another, it was good to finally do not have the weight of those questions. But, one day sitting in my shitty car, I remembered something I had told myself when I was 8 when another secret traumatic event occurred, "" I am going to study hard and get far from this place "", that village had only brought me pain and abuse. I decided to go to University and get something back out of all that self taught stuff about computers.I worked really hard, and spent a year literally sustained on bread, water and sugar. Would kill one or other animal and/or fish, but I had made the point to put aside as much money I could, just in case. Past that year I entered the university and those damn questions were back ""what do you father do?"" ""How did he die?"". Kept the lying ""accident"". One day, I had made friends with a girl and one night she was feeling really down, her father had been having an affair and her mother had found out and the whole thing was pretty shitty. I took her to a remote place where we could just stay in the car and see the stars between the scattered clouds. And while just was telling me all that, she let us out ""I wish I could just die, I find that people that kill themselves are really brave"". At that point I started to cry in silence, the tears kept pouring down my face, while she kept asking what happened. I then decided to just tell her in a very confronting tone ""you are a fucking idiot, how can you say that people are brave for killing themselves? People that kill themselves never deserved anything that this world gave them."" Understandably, she yelled back ""Who gives you the right to speak to me like that?"". And then, for the first time, ""Because my father killed himself when I was four, he gave up and left me and my mother behind. I was only four, and he simply walked away and was not there to protect me every time I needed. Brave is to face the hardship. So I do not want you to ever say that killing yourself is something brave, think about the people you would leave behind, how your decision would affect their lives."" From that point on I never more felt ashamed to admit that my father was not brave enough to find an alternative path and took the easy way out.I ended up finishing my degree, getting a nice few jobs. Every time I look back the main thing I always see if the void I have always felt. I decided to never have kids because I never wanted to not be there for them for any reason. I know that there are millions of people that have had much worst lives than I have, I always been lucky, I always chased that same luck. I am not brave, I still avoid going back to that small rural village. I am not even living in that country anymore. I feel down lots of time, and in the last couple of years I have been feeling more and more down, really down, questioning my existence, and yes suicide crossed my mind. I do not want to kill myself, and I will not, if I die I do not mind, but I will not kill myself. I have been feeling more and more the need to give up on everything, and I will probably will. I will probably leave my job and everything behind and go away a couple of years to the middle of nowhere living on whatever I can.If you ever think about killing yourself, please think about how that decision my affect the other people in your life. My father's suicide has always been a darkness in my life and it will always be. Death is not the only solution, there are other ways to get isolation and away from everything, and even in the far chance you come to the conclusion death is the only way out, well then die giving your life in a meaningful action. Go kill poachers in Africa, go fight terrorists, go help people in natural disasters, but please remember the people you leave behind. You will not be there when they need the most. my father killed himself",Suicidal

12355,"context for this post is that I have struggled with depression for most of my life. i was not in a position to do anything about it before, up until very recently, because it was never just the only problems i had going on. there was always some other Serious Issue slammed into eight other things that i had to work my way around every day in order to actually function. a lot has happened these past two years. i have stabler relationships, i have friends who i like (i just cannot really talk to them about any of these issues because they have never experienced long lasting significant mental health issues and have personally told me that while they are here for me, they do not understand and have no frame of reference to understand what I am going through). most of the things that I have had to deal with these past six or seven years- extreme mood swings, crushing apathy towards anything, loss of interest in activities and eating etc. have mostly died down into what i would call normal levels that almost everyone experiences in their life. they are manageable i guess for lack of better words. the only downside was that it meant that the week long (sometimes even months long) depressive episodes and sudden onsets of debilitating depression *(its just depression in it is severe bland dictionary meaning. severe feelings of despondency and despair. i do not have any other way of explaining it)* have gone from being pushed to the side lines in order to deal with other stuff, to front and centre of my life now. i cry on the commute back and forth between my classes. two weeks ago the feelings of depression that I would been crushing down all week suddenly peaked and i skipped my last two classes because i genuinely did not feel up to it mentally or able to concentrate or focus because of how bad i felt and how depressed i was. i wish i was exaggerating in order to make a coherent and simple case of *'yeah here is proof that i have debilitation depression that affects my life 24/7'* but I am not, when i say that every day i have to fight down the majority of me that goes 'avoid your friends hide out in the bathrooms during intervals and breaks until you are normal and capable of human interaction again' even if i know in my head that being around my friends will make me feel better and that seeing them will remind me that no matter how stupid things are for me mentally right now that they are there. sometimes i win and sometimes i do not. it feels like an uphill battle where none of the lessons i learn (being with friends is good. do not isolate yourself) get retained or remembered through idk brain muscle memory or anything. this is the best that I have been in years, if only because I have managed to keep it at a *'one step forward two steps back herculean effort to take another one step forward to balance things again'* cycle. but i know its only going to get harder and more intense for me at school next year because of the increase in workload and just the general insanity of stress and uni applications and important exams that determine your future and decisions that I am making this year that are supposed to be plans for the next five years of my life. right now feels like the only opportunity I will have to take some kind of action (medication lmao) and get used to all the side effects, while the academic stakes are still relatively manageable even if it makes me cry sometimes. i guess for me it was always the money that made feel :| about getting diagnosed and the leftover remains of when i was more seriously mentally ill (being alive is a waste of money complex hahaha). the counsellor I have been seeing for the past three or something years tried to broach the topic of *possible diagnosis for depression* *just in my opinion it mgiht be wrong just let me say my opinion and you can disagree this is based off of what i know from seeing you semi regularly for these last few years* two weeks ago (same day i missed those last two classes lmao) but i shot them down because there is really no pathway after getting diagnosed, at least not for me, that does not end in medication. I have been friends with a few people who were diagnosed with major depressive disorder among other depression disorders, all of which took medication. we have fallen out of contact due to the past year of lockdown and pandemic etc but i still remember talking to them about the side effects of medication and whether it was really worth it because they were still in pain they were still struggling even on medication. talking to them made me realize that they were right and that it could only get worse if treatment was not taken. some potentially severe side effects are worth not feeling like hell and being obstructed by your own mind every day of your life. **the only issue is my parents, who despite knowing almost zero if not absolutely nothing about depression and other mental health issues (genuine quote from one of them was 'i know nothing about this and i do not understand and i do not need you to explain it to me. medication has terrible side effects that will ruin your life) yet still manage to have hardline anti-medication, for lack of better words, views because of their percieved horrific life ruining side effects.** is medication worth it despite the side effects?",Depression

12357,"Hi everyone.I have ADHD, Borderline Personality Disorder, Depression, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Asthma, and Epilepsy. All of this has been diagnosed professionally.I had a very rough upbringing. When I was young I definitely tried to avoid it, but there is only so much you can do. My mother was a depressed single parent who was a hoarder. She was gay and my dad was not around, so I often got made fun of as a child from other kids. For a few years in my early childhood her partner was an alcoholic who burned all of our things, so that was awful. I just saw every bad side of life as a child, I feel like.As a teenager I was sexually assaulted a few times. That definitely made things worse for me. I have not really talked about it a lot, but I do have nightmares about it and random times where I just cannot get sexual with my boyfriend. As an adult I have had issues with jobs. I never got to go to college, I had to leave home at 17 and afterwords I just never had the money to go to school, I also did not have the support. My ADHD is so severe that for a long time I was medicated on the strongest doses they had. We tried 3 different medications, nothing seemed to work. I was either hyper, or a zombie with no appetite. But never able to focus.I have been fired before. I have never had a job for over 2 years. I am 25. Every job I have had I have felt stupid. I just cannot learn fast enough. I am too emotional. I am too hyper. I am 3 weeks into a new job and it is the worst fit I have ever had. I love the company and my coworkers, but the position just does not mix well with me. I have cried already the past three nights.For a long time I have just tried to power through all of the issues I am facing mentally and physically, but it now feels like my head is imploding in on itself.

12362,"I am losing a lot of friends. Since I started therapy I realized that I am really vulnerable to be mentally abused by female friends. I always had tons of female friends and I am losing them all in the shortest amount of time. Some of them abuse me mentally and when I speak up they say fuck you and block me. I lost 10 friends like that and everytime I meet someone new it happens again. I am like a magnet to abusers. They never physically abuse me or openly mentally abuse me. Its little Chips in my mental health that they make bigger and then act like they did not knew it would happen. I am on the shorter side and learned to love myself since I started therapy. I still have my bad days and some of them told me things like ""tall men are really manly and so hot"" and I am not judging, but they know that it hurts me and then act like they did not knew. They always gaslight me to look like the dumbass that is deserved it when in reality I just want someone to talk to who does not think less of me just because i like feminine things. Even worse is that I do look stereotypically ""masculine"" so they think even less of me when I do not have that manly side to me. My best friend of 6 years who was like a soulmate broke up with her boyfriend and then told me I did not help her enough and that I am at fault that she nearly killed herself because I am a horrible human being and did not help her. She was the last person left and if I wanted to vent or cry about something she was my goto place. Before she blocked me she said she never met a bigger pussy then me and that its no wonder I am so fucking lonely. When I told her that she only gets attention from dudes because she is hot but a mental health mess I am the bad one. Its true tho. She is a mess and nobody would want to be with her because she does not want to get help. She gets attention because of her attractiveness and her body. Then she blocked me and I do not have anybody left to vent to. My therapist appointment would have been today but she is on vacation for 14 days and I have to wait for another week.

12372,"Wondering about mental health (depression?) Advice/comments welcomed and appreciated.Preface: I know I cannot get an actual diagnosis from this site, but I would really like to get peoples opinions/thoughts on this. I am just going to dump a bunch of information here, and I am sorry if its too long. I am going to treat this like a rant, so it will not be organized.Over the past couple of years, I feel like my mental health has been declining. In 2019, I started spending more and more time alone in my bed, and its continued on to this day. I have been passing it off as laziness (Ibe been a lazy person in general for quite a while), but I think its more than that, because I used to only have short periods of laziness. In other words, I used to have occasional lazy days, but now every day feels like a lazy day. I sit on my bed, watching YouTube, listening to music, daydreaming, and checking my apps. When I am not working (I work part-time), I mostly just do these lazy activities.I also currently have a lack of hobbies- probably related to laziness. I want to pursue hobbies and interests like I used to. I want to spend time doing something I enjoy. But, I just cannot get the motivation to. I feel like I cannot get the motivation to do much, even low-effort activities or tasks. My lack of productivity and hobbies has led me to think very negatively about myself. I feel like I am skill-less, talentless, boring, and useless. Its a vicious cycle: lack of motivation = not productive = more negative thoughts. I have also noticed that I am not excited over things Id normally be. For example, I recently went on a short vacation, but I generally felt bored throughout it, when normally Id be anxious and excited to do things. I felt like I could not get excited. Aside from COVID, nothing huge has happened in my life recently that would typically evoke depression, so its hard to pinpoint where this is coming from, and that is frustrating. I also do not feel too bad (its like a constant meh with occasional dark days), or mentally suffocated, like people with depression have described, so I am not sure. I sorta feel like I am overreacting or being dramatic. But I am also quite concerned.To summarize: I am constantly lazy, I am not productive, I have lots of negative thoughts about myself and my life, and I feel like I am in a constant state of boredom and indifference.

I have felt that way all my life. I have never really told anyone.I am embarrassed, so I have never talked about it openly. But I cannot anymore. I feel an infinite depth inside me that I have never been able to fill and continue to not be able to. Something is pulling me into the dark.

We seemed to be really into each other, enjoyed each other company, went on about 4 dates that had me fall for him badly.I have a history of disastrous dating experiences, most people I have seen never even got to the dating stage, it is just how I am, makes people want to distant themselves.I have noticed this time I came on too strong, like I confessed him how much I was into him after a couple dates. My social anxiety makes me shut down my personality when I am with someone I like, because I am scared of being judged. My mind just goes in auto pilot, I blank, I stutter and do not even realise I am being weird until afterwards, thinking I should have been more spontaneous. I think to his eyes I might have appeared like I did not want to deepen our connection, looked uninterested and uninteresting, all because I was not comfortable with myself being around him.Also think that the quality of our dates was not varied enough, which might have quickly killed the interest, we were just hanging out at each others' with no real plan or activity set in place, so that might have made it stale.It kind of died when we agreed to meet up one weekend where he said he would let me know if he was free, then never called and have not heard from him since then.I am so sad and annoyed that I have allowed the fear of being myself in front of him being the reason of him getting bored of me.I have been through a hell of a year, escaping an abusive friendship which has made me miserable for a good part of my days, and is still causing me mental distress. I have only slightly mentioned this to him, without going too much into detail because I did not want to freak him out, just like I have left out many of the issues that I struggle with with my mental health.I cannot see any light, I want to be better, I want to make me happy and be happy with someone, I just never know how much of me it is okay to share with someone. They freak out if I tell them I like them, they freak out if I stay silent, they freak out if I talk about my demons. I know I should talk about what makes me interesting, my dreams, my values and what I believe in, the truth is I do not have enough self esteem to even be able to believe in myself, if I talk about my dreams out loud I would sound unexciting because I have always been the last person to believe in me. it is a lot to ask anyone to put up with such an emotional mess, I know no one is perfect, but I doubt anyone would want to start a relationship if they fear their partner would be problematic to be around.

I remember in third grade I had gotten a C in some stupid class, my mother told me to my face that if I was born white she would have happily chosen them to be their son. My dad watched her say that, but he never denied it. I was never a person to them, only luggage. I fear that its becoming that way with my friends too. When we would call and talk they all seem uninterested when I am around. My best friend even just leaves to talk with other people when I become boring. I hate myself. I cannot even talk to people anymore. I just want my friends again. I do not want to be alone anymore. This year Ill be a senior in a new high school. If I kill myself no one would even remember my name. Every friend I have had would forget about me when they become adults. I do not know what to do anymore. Is there even a point to continue living when no one even gives a shit about me? Should I kill myself?",Suicidal

The problem is I do not have any motivation at all. Whenever I think of it I just feel like I should kill myself for just dissapper, stop existing. My mother and father keeps saying me to study but I just feel so empty and it feels like my future is foggy. I do like to learn cyber security and wants to learn as I want graduate in this field and I know if I study for the exam I will have better future but I just cannot. It feels like something is weighing me down like something feels heavy in my chest . I do not know what I should do. Evenone around me is like you should clear this exam and that and I feel like I m just a disappointment. If I try to share my feelings there is noone who will listen to me. My mother's says stop making her worry. My father and I do not have that good of relationship amd my brother also says depressing stuff about himself but says me to do this and that. I always have to motivate my brother and wherever there is fight between my father and mother I have to get involved so that it does not result into violence, which used to happen. My mother always says she is living with my father just because so that I can get a good job so that we can live happily then but it just makes me feel even more guilty. What should I do, I feel so lost. I do not even have courage to kill myself and just always says I should die or just dissappear. Even my brother says things like if I die you will have to become successful so that mother can live happily and I always motivate him but there is noome who I can share this feeling. Everyone just dismisses my feelings. I understand everyone has his burden and when I think of this I feel ashamed of myself for being like thus. If you have read this far I am grateful as this is a huge thing for me. Due to hesitation even if I want to I cannot share my feelings wtih anyone face to face but just knowing someone read this is enough for me. Thx a lot I m confused what should I do",Suicidal
12411,"Therapy is so expensive, and it is completely unpredictable if the therapist will even be able to healthily provide for your needs and personality. I had a therapist who was shit, she rambled too much about her own life and gave me toxic advice. But I thought that there was no way out, and three year later I am still struggling. Everyone tells you to go to therapy as if its free, even I have done that at times. Every time I crave the thought of therapy and feel like I desperately need it, I think about the price, and I am immediately pulled off. I want to go to therapy, but the price feels like an obstacle that you need to constantly pass.I get that people have to make livelihoods, but I have to pay more than quadruple what my age group can make in an hour to just talk about my feelings and for them to tell me stuff I already know. When people say that money does not make happiness, think about therapy. I have done hours of research trying to find a cheaper therapist, but the cheapest I found is like 35.

I just moved to Austin, Texas a few months ago with my girlfriend and things have been spiraling out of control for the both of us and I am starting to feel there is no fixing things. I am terrified of being alone, I have social anxiety, and I have become too dependent on her which has taken its toll on her mental health. I am facing repeated thoughts of just wanting my life to be over, I am so tired of feeling like such a worthless piece of garbage, I am tired of feeling so alone all the time and that nobody cares. I have debated trying to OD on my seroquel, or OD on drugs like cocaine, I really wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up. I do not know anyone here, my girlfriend wants to leave me, I am just a fucking mess and I hate myself so god damned much.I am trying to do the right thing, I have been getting denied insurance coverage for TMS and EDMR therapies to deal with my mental illness and the longer it gets drawn out the worse things have been getting. I am tired, I just want to be loved, and I do not even love myself, how can I?? My mom died of suicide at a far younger age than I am now, and I also think I just wish so much that I could be with her. If she was still here my life would not have turned out so shitty, I would not have had to deal with emotional abuse and neglect from my other family members after she died, I would not be a fucking alcoholic addict that cannot handle just day to day living.What sucks the most is that I know what I am capable of, I know I am an intelligent person with a good job, but this depression, this trauma, this anxiety, it makes me step in my own way and I am losing that battle a little bit more every single day. I know I am the only one who can truly overcome this, but in actuality, I do not think I am capable. I do not know what the tipping point will be but it feels like its getting close, I am one tragic event away from just blowing my brains out. Nobody would even know, I do not want people to mourn me when I die, if I felt otherwise, I would be much further off from suicide. I am so far from home, my girlfriend does not love me or want to be with me anymore, I have no friends here, I am like a literal fucking ghost. I have two cats and a dog at home that I love so much, but my girlfriend would care for them if I were gone, she loves those animals to death.I am running out of reasons to stay alive and it is scaring the hell out of me.

12422,"To start i do not know how to start. I am writing just to get out of my own head. As far as i can remember there has always been a hole in me. I know insert joke here. But seriously i have to fake emotions on a daily bases. let us be clear i can feel feelings but two is all i have. Sadness and anger. But because of this need to belong i try to be more human but end up slipping up and going into self destructive mood. I have screwed up time and time again. And in the wake of my destruction i hurt my family not with physical abuse but because of my actions i keep them at arms length at all times never allowing them to see the real me. I lie, cheat and steal. I have had and still have a addiction problem which helps self medicate my mood swings and depression. My earliest memories from where this void started was when i was 8 or 9. A friend hung himself accidentally with a swing set chain. I was not strong enough to left him up and out. Each time i could manage to pick him up the weight of his body dropped and the chain got tighter. He did not die. A neighbor heard me scream and rushed to save him. I will never forget the feeling of hopelessness that creep into me that day. I was not the hero here that i thought one day i would become. From there on years turned into decades and that feeling of self worth i lost became to much to bear. For a time being i felt comfort in an older women but was ultimately taking advantage of. At 15 i was sleeping with a married 35yr old women who just like me was broken. But broken in a different way. Her husband was dying and i guess we both used each other to one extant to an other to feel a quick sense of release. A release of stress and sadness but it was fleeting and to avoid her misconduct she tried to pin everything on me. Telling friends and coworkers i was stalking her. Which was further then the case. My closet friends laughed and believe every drop of bull shit she came up with. My friends i thought know my character better and would have stuck up with me. But they did not and in the end her husband came into the restaurant we both worked and told my boss and coworkers the truth. My friends apologize and said they should have know better, bah bah. But all i felt was that void grow bigger with every mustered up excuses they had to justify their betrayal. If you just told us one of them said. Sure that would have made everything better. Dear such and such i have been screwing or 35 manager on the weekends at work. What do not believe me? that is weird. To tell the truth i did not much believe it either and i was the one getting banged. that is when a switch turned off and i started to numb the emptiness with pot and pills. that is the most i can write today. I feel alittle better and less crazy. Ill write more later on. I did beat the battle of drugs and depression for a while. But the war is always on going. Thank you for letting me vent.

My way of thinking about life, my will and reasoning were drastic and still are. The way I dealt with deppresion were drugs, cutting my wrist, risking life while walking on the edge of a building. A few years ago I tried to drown myself underneath the ice, hoping that I would not find the exit if I decided to live ( as I was almost drowning I found fisherman's hole through which I was able to break through and survive )I would not call myself dumb as I have created a few businesses (which failed eventually as I did not invest enough time and money) and now work as a programmer in a company which pays me good, but I failed my native language exams. I will not get my diploma and I will not enroll in the university. My mom recently went into psychosis which is not getting better. it is really hard to decide how I feel about that as I hated her most of my life, but we had our moments. My dad seems depressed too, I have two younger sisters and it is really hard to see him and I struggle to take care of them. I keep failing my driving exams. When taking them I start to feel really anxious and just stop the exam as my clutch leg starts ticking uncontrollably.I cannot stop thinking about suicide and my morality about it. I know that I have to support the family, live for my friends too, but it just overwhelms me.Now at nights I just drug myself until I pass out while listening to music and it is the only way I can keep my thoughts away from suicide.

Please do not tell me any platitudes like ""you cannot be that ugly"" or ""there is someone for everyone"" etc. I am sick of people pretending.

12425,"My parents separated when I was 9 and since then everything went wrong. My childhood cat and my grandpa died a few months later. I felt sad almost everyday and cried almost every night. A year later I went in primary school and things got even worst. I started having social anxiety which made me miss a lot of my classes. I also had difficulties at my new school even tho I used to be quite good in my old school. I was 11 back then and thought a lot about suicide but I knew I still had hope for the future. Because of my bad grades my parents took me to a specialised center to discover what was going on with my brain. We then discovered I was gifted which made me feel even worse about myself, as I could not understand why I had bad grades if I was supposed to have so much ease. My grades went extremely down and my mental health did too. I still had friends but life was not really good. My parents then tried to find solutions to that problem. I was disgusted of where I was living and wanted to start everything back from 0. So my parents and I thought it would be a good idea to move to another country that speaks another language ( do not ask me why even I do not know how stupid we were to choose that option ).I have then tried everything in that new country but nothing worked. After multiple years of sadness and stress I was officially diagnosed with severe depression and social anxiety by a psychiatrist. At that point I was not even going to school anymore and I started homeschooling which did not work because of my anxiety. We also tried medication for multiple months which made my depression even worst than before. I am now 16, doing nothing scholar. Stressed, sad, angry and lonely with no friends, at thousand of kilometres of my dad. And I cannot find anything to do to stop that constant pain, other than killing myself. I have no more hope.

I see a lot of posts of people who have shit situations on here, and I understand completely why you feel the way you feel.

At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training.

12477,"I have been meaning to talk about what is going on with my life (in the hopes that idk someone can help or confirm that my life should be at an end). For the past month now I think I have been shut off from my friends and family, delaying what needs to be done (aka suicide) and now that I am planning to do it (again) I am stuck trying to write my suicide note. I know that I need to do it to relieve my family's problem and stop this never ending cycle of getting better then shutting off then doing all over again (that is the best way I can say it ig ""shutting off"" because dk if it is a mental breakdown). I know I am never going to get better but my family still has hope and keeping that hope longer will only hurt them more because I know how this ends. It will be either I succeed this time because pills were not enough so this time will hopefully work because it is a rope or I fail and will be forced to therapy and maybe get better for a while then be back here again. I have tried everything medication, exercise, a stable diet, and therapy, but obviously it is not working so what is the point? I am forever stuck like this... things will never get better, the storm will never end, and I am wasting resources and time of the people who care about me. I know I have to write this suicide note I owe it to them. it is really difficult to write a suicide note",Depression
12479,"Hi all! I could really use some advise. Thank you in advance to those who comment. :) Long-story-short, I feel trapped in unfulfilling office jobs that do not align with who I am as a person. Every day I go through some sort of existential crisis, and lately I have really been wondering what the purpose of life is. On top of this, USA's economic and societal climate really makes me depressed. Jobs I would *actually* be happy with would not pay a livable wage. Cost of living is too damn high, and greed is so rampant amongst corporations/rich people. Anyway, I have been working in my ""professional"" career for about 7 years now, but I still feel like a scared little girl when it comes to taking on responsibilities and talking to other people. All the information that comes my way at work does not stick. I do not have interest in retaining it, and it is really starting to bite me in the butt. My career motivation is tanked, and I feel very guilty about it - I know this is not who I really I am... Seriously, I can be a very driven and happy person! But especially lately I really just want to shut myself away. I want to quit, but bills need to be paid!So my question is: **how do I get out of this rutt and find fulfillment?** I have tried therapy, anti-depressants, career coaches, exercising, and eating well. I have also changed jobs a couple times, gone back to school for Master's, etc. But over time I sink back to these bad feelings. **How can I gain confidence in my job and skills? What will make me WANT to wake up everyday?** I miss the feeling of ""the world is my oyster"". The world is shit. Advise on Fulfillment?",Suicidal
12486,"I guess you could say I have been going through it a bit recently, I tend to distance myself from people during this time instead of talking about anything to anyone. I have found that recently, whenever any of my friends vent or unload their problems to me, it triggers me and causes me to self-harm.I guess I need to work more on my communication skills, because I typically do not ever make my needs or boundaries very clear to anyone. But sometimes I find it very difficult to tell people that I cannot be there for them when they are clearly in a crisis. I also hold back from opening up to my friends, because in a way, I know how it affects me when others do it and would not wish the same on them. And it sometimes seems like me telling them that I feel overwhelmed also feels like me unloading? How can I possibly bring it up without feeling like a hypocrite? Just some thoughts going through my head right now.I am just curious as to if anyone else is experiencing something similar and/or has any advice, or even support.

12489,"I am a 22 years old female in a relationship, I have no issues when it comes to that, we get along well.My main issue is myself, I am tired all the time, I get bored easily, my mood changes a lot, I literally feel the slightest change in his voice and tell myself OMG HE GOT MAD. I started having stomach pains when I stress or when I feel sad and I actually started shaking when speaking or interacting with new people. This never happens to me before, I used to talk in college in front of 50 people and do well.cannot say I have any goal in life, I do not wish for something tbh and most of the time I just feel sad for no reason.What upsets me the most is when I think too much. For example I forgot the meaning of a sign for the driving school, so now I just feel worthless, feel like I am a failure, that I cannot do anything, all for a damn sign.This happens even if I scratch a small thing, I immediately think this is what I do all the time, I just break stuff, that I am clumsy and worthless.I told to my husband, he really tries to help me, but tbh I do not even know what causes it. I am supposed to be a psychologist myself and I swear I cannot find any childhood trauma, any real issue.If anyone could help me in any way, I would really appreciate.

12490,"I just do not know what to say. Since I was let us say half a year in homeschooling and lockdown I have lost all my social skills. I do not know how to lead a normal conversation, I do not know how to keep my stories interesting and the worst of all: I completely forgot how to ""undertand"" the thoughts and words of the person that is talking to me.That would not be a that big problem if I would not overthink everything all the time. That started since I was in quarantine (no social contacts too). I was actually (or am) an extrovert person and I love to talk to my friends. But now it became less and as I said I do not even know how to lead on a conversation. it is always my mission to start one but I just cannot. And with my overthinking I am not just unsatisfied with a bad dialogue. No my stupid head is tearing every little word apart just to see if there was a insult or a sign that the person does not like me.it is so surreal. I mean, I KNOW that I like my friends. I love them since they are a better family for me and I pay every price to make them happpy. And my friends like me. But... then there is my head, that is not acting or thinking the way I want.This is seriously damaging my relationships since I often act offended even though there was NOTHING. And I do not want to do this. I do not want to play the victim in this because there is NO victim. But... I just cannot. There is something that just acts and does not think.My relationsship with two of my friends is damaged because they did some shit to me... I, in person, want to forgive them. I said this. But I always think about it. I always think about how they left me and now be like ""hey we are friends, right?"". I am not the same since they left me once and I told them but they cannot fix this of course. It happened and I want to overcome this. But my head just makes me feel different than what I really want... I am just so confused. I also get angry so much faster. Or let us say frustrated. it is so bad with me and I am always ashamed afterwards... I never want to hurt my friends this way and I hope that is not the reason why they are talking less to me.I do not have fun with my hobbies anymore. I do not appreciate the things I liked before. The only times I appreciate my time is while I can talk to people especially my friends. But I just stand in my own way for a better view...

12495,"Title, basically. I am kind of terrified. I have completely lost entire conversations, and looking back on those conversations (the ones I can actually read because they happened over text) it seems like someone else wrote them. They include details I do not know literally until I read them, and leave out things that I now do.I can never remember my best friend's major. it is engineering, I think, but which sort? I have no idea. I have asked him about it dozens of times, I know that much.Friends are always introducing me to music. A few months later, I will invariably try to introduce them to the same music as if the first conversation never happened.I recently broke up with my partner. Part of why I did was because I felt he was an awful communicator. Then it came to my attention, through both him and other people who were close to the situation, that I actually just *straight-up forgot* a great deal of our communication on a few key issues. I remember it now, but I do not know if it will stay that way.I am an active member on a worldbuilding forum elsewhere on the internet, or at least I used to be. Looking back at what I wrote there, it feels so... foreign, again, like someone else wrote it.I can never remember my childhood as clearly as my sibling. They can recite to me all kinds of things about family gatherings, semi-distant relatives, and various other memories that I have absolutely no connection to.I am horrible with names. I used to think that it was normal, but now I am questioning that assumption in light of everything else.I am currently visiting with a friend. Planning logistics for this trip has been an incredible hassle, because I have thought that we discussed things that we never had a conversation about, and entirely forgotten conversations that *did* happen.I can never remember the tasks I need to complete. I always thought that it was laziness, or my capacity for straight-up denial, but I am not so sure at this point.Everyone--*everyone*--that knows me, apparently knows me to be very repetitive in conversation, far more so over the course of a day. I had no idea. I always think it is my first time saying something until someone tells me otherwise. I always thought nothing of it, but...This is an awful revelation. I feel like I am going crazy, like I do not know what is actually real in my life or what *looks* real just because I am missing some key detail. I am afraid that I have forgotten so much about things between my ex-partner and I that the breakup made no sense and was actually caused by mental illness instead of a genuine understanding of our situation. I am just really, really afraid. I do not know what to do.Is this explicable with depression alone? Do I probably have something else? Are there SSRIs that improve memory, or some other effective treatment? Please, any answers would be of help. I am really frightened. I am depressed. I have really, really bad memory loss. Am I crazy in some other way, or can my depression alone explain this?",Depression
12496,"Hi everyone. First time poster. I just need to get this off my chest to people who might understand. To preface, I have MDD OCD and GAD as well as PTSD.I (23F) have been in a 2.5 year relationship with my boyfriend (24M) and we have been through a ton together. He is my best friend. He is somebody who needs his alone time to recharge which I happily give him. Recently, I have been extra depressed and just changed my medication from 450 mg wellbutrin and 20 mg prozac to 300 mg wellbutrin and 25 mg pristiq. It is a big adjustment period for me.I have been jobless since 2020. I worked as a nanny before and ended up quitting due to a personal life altering event. He stood with me through that.Recently, he has been distant and I have not seen him in 2 weeks. I have been asking him if there is something wrong, etc. Yesterday I finally said that this is not ok with me and I need quality time to feel valued in our relationship. He then told me that yes, something is wrong, and yes some of it has to do with us but he will talk to me tomorrow night. I did not want to wait 36 hours for him to break up with me if that is what was happening and finally got a call a few hours later.He said that he never knows what to say when his parents ask about me since I do not have a job and do not go to school and live at home. He spent a couple weeks alone and realized that our relationship is not in sync anymore. He wants me to succeed and do better for myself and I need to prove to him that I can do that for our relationship to work. Which I get completely. But taking a break with no contact for months is essentially a breakup in my opinion and he keeps insisting that he does NOT want to do break up.I feel like he has broken every promise he has ever made me by abandoning me in a time I need support the most. I have supported him through so much and I feel betrayed. He does not know what taking a break entails because we have never done it before and we are each others first loves and first serious LTR. I do not think he knows what he wants. I love him so much it hurts and I know he feels the same but this is basically a breakup and he cannot see that. I am trying as hard as I can to be realistic and logical but I feel like I cannot go on without him by my side. He is everything to me. But for this to be the solution for a problem he has never brought up feels devastating and unacceptable to me. If he needs time apart, okay that is fine I get that but to give me an ultimatum out of the blue makes me feel like I have ultimately succumbed to my mental illness. I have been seeking new treatment and was finally starting to feel better but now I feel like I cannot move forward and do the necessary work because I have been abandoned by the love of my life. I am spiraling and do not know what to do with myself.I want him to be the one I call when something good happens. I want him to be the one to share my accomplishments and celebrate with. I feel so betrayed and gutted. I cannot do this without him. I want to give up.Were meeting later tonight to talk in person. I do not know if I should just break it off entirely to save us both the pain of a future breakup and get the pain over with now. Right now i do not believe in myself and without his support I do not know how I can achieve anything for a long time until I heal. Who knows how long that will take? I feel Like a chunk of my soul has died along with any hope for a healthy future.I am sorry this is so long and if you read this thank you from the bottom of my heart. Feeling like I cannot go on",Depression
12497,"I think the only thing that would have ever made me happy is connections. Having friends, or a loving family, strong relationships. I do not know why I am so unlovable. Like my very existence is some sort of offense. I would do anything and change everything about me if anyone would just let me in. It hurts so much. I know now that I will never have that. I tried to kill myself last week. I called everyone I knew. Only a couple people even replied. Even then, they did not really want to help. The only reason why I did not, is because I am stupid and naive, and keep telling myself someone will love me, even though all the evidence is to the contrary. Today I made a big step though. I accepted it. I accepted that I will never be anything to anyone. I will never be loved. And when I am gone, I will not be remembered. Yes, It will always hurt, and I will carry that with me for the rest of my life. But I will carry it still. it is freeing because I know who I am now. I am no one. I wish I could have been happy. I wish I could have been loved. I will settle for free. I am free because I am no one. And that little freedom is worth living for, at least for now. But its not permanent. I need to keep searching.

I am so completely unhappy with my job, manager &amp; team. They are not understanding of my anxiety in general and that normal job duties (customer service facing) are just so draining/take a lot for me to exert out. I have been going into the office a few times a wk bc of meetings and have to be in for the clients and I am having meltdowns before and during my time in the office. Yesterday I was so dizzy, shaking, and just threw up as soon as I arrived. Today I am crying so much because I have to go in tomorrow. All the while I am trying to fake it when I am office and getting so sick of people asking me how I am when I am not even ok at all. Or when they say its nice to me or ask if I like being back in because absolutely I do not. Since the pandemic I have WFH helping another team out and I have absolutely thrived. I am hoping to transfer but they do not have current roles open and unsure when that will happen. I am trying to last another yr until I move because I cannot financially afford to quit and/or look for another job bc in my city or does not have high paying roles for the most part and I am currently assisting my mom.

12503,"If you would see me anywhere you would probably think I am happy because of my kindness and smiling and that I am handsome because I workout or whatever I do not really care, but none of it is true. None of anything is true with me. I am dying inside at almost all times and if I am around people and happy those are the times when I am most sad. Oddly enough being alone is the only thing that makes me feel better but is one of the main reasons I am in this position in the first place. Its a never ending cycle of just hating me. The voices have been winning for some time now and I can no longer control my thoughts nor where they lead and make me believe. If you ever see me (you will not) just know all that I do is to not have to burden anyone else or make anyone else even feel 1% or that they might have played a part at all.

12506,Its a long story but to sum it up we both fell so in love with each other instantly but then we realized we both needed time and space to heal and work on ourselves before we reconnect. In that time apart I made so much progress and she was doing the same. Until one I night I sent her a late night text on her birthday saying that anyone after her is #2 and the beginning of the text I sent said I believe my soul is giving me no choice but to send this to you yadayadayada after that she blocked my phone &amp; insta immediately. Once I saw her do that I immediately became suicidal and have been ever since. All I ever wanted was her and the life we were going to create together and I blew it. I am an attractive guy that can obtain another woman easily but I do not care for anyone else. Now I spend my days online seeing other people being suicidal and speaking about doing it. I guess it helps? In reality it does not its just a time killer until I eventually go through with the act. I deleted all social media accounts. Have friends I could contact and go hang with if I wanted but that and just putting in effort to live again seems utterly pointless. Its like time is just ticking away until I am gone I am ready to exit. I am 30 and I lost the love of my life before it truly began.,Suicidal
12510,"TWI've gone on a very bad downward spiral again recently. I tried to take my own life back in '18, spent some days in the psych ward. Some of you have probably been there, too.Since then, I have not really gotten better - I have just crawled my way into surviving with a strenght I was not sure I had. Two weeks after the attempt I went back to work, and I now realize damn, that is so f\* up. It was like ""now hurry up and be profitable again""I quit that job last year, before the pandemic. Since then, I tried to get another job. I recently landed one which I was really hoping was just going to be something I could handle. Woop-dee-doo. How do I fool myself every time. Two months later, here we are - I collapsed, hard, this time more from my anxiety than from my depression. I just told my boss I was sick until I could figure out what to do. I called my psych; she knows me well. She told me she suggested at least a month off. I know this company would kick me to the curb if I take one month off, so I though it was better to resign saying I got another job offer, patch it up, bye bye.What else can I do other than try my hardest to fix the things this mental illness causes as best as I can? Nothing else.My mom understands. Not everything, because no one who has not had a mental illness can fully understand it. But she is supportive. she is been my anchor all this time. She is the sole reason I am typing today; I would, no doubt, be gone if she were gone. Things is, I moved back here last year, after quitting my job. The reason I moved was because my grandma, who I was living with since 2012, had a stroke and now needs a full-time caregiver. it is a two bedroom apartment, so I had to get out. I guess my stepfather, who ""sees me as daughter"" (pft) has not really liked that. I guess he feels, like always, as if I were here to try and steal my mom or something. I actually felt bad and I thought maybe I am being an obstacle between a couple, even though being honest and kind to myself (quite rare) I have helped the hell out of them after he was diagnosed cancer last year and I took care of the house while they were gone.I think now he just wants me out. I am quite impressed at his lack of care despite being a firsthand witness of my attempt in '18. I asked my mom because I felt something was off (they are gone til tomorrow). She said he, I quote, ""is worried that I will never be able to live on my own.""I do not know if she does but I do see the meaning behind those words. it is a not very subtle ""get out of my house and leave me alone with my wife"". I guess I should have seen it coming, knowing the only love that is unconditional is my mom's. As I wrote down this post I calmed down a little bit. Right now I need to get back on my feet. I will resign from this job because there is no way I can handle it next week, or ever. I will work with my psychiatrist to get me back to ""semi functional"" as I like to call it. Then I am grabbing my money and I am getting the hell out. Screw this. Screw him and his expectations. He can shove his fake care and love up where light does not reach. He has the nerve to judge me, the nerve to expect me to go on after I collapse, when he has two kids (32 and 27) who have NEVER. WORKED.NEVER.I guess I kind of answered myself in this post, but I would still appreciate any input you might have. I feel stronger now. I feel angry. that is good - angry is better than guilty. Eventually I know I will just let go of him, because I do not live with resentment. How am I going to manage once I leave? I have no clue. But I cannot manage here anyway, either. And if I am not wanted, then I shall go.The good side of me still wishes him good. The good side of me cries at how stupid I am, because amidst having a mental breakdown I felt so happy that yesterday he was told his cancer treatment ends next month. I was so genuinely happy, because I do love him. I guess I am just not loved back. And you can tell me ""he loves me in his own way"", but I do not believe in that. You either love someone or you do not. Thank you for the space. I will be down, and up, and down, and up again. But I think eventually, I will just pack up my things and go. And remind myself, yet again, every day, that love is absolutely conditional. How do you deal with the judgement and disappointment of others when they realize you are not who they expected?",Depression
12517,"Dog went into heart failure over a holiday weekend. No vet could take her. Had to find an emergency clinic. They told me 200 dollars just to fill out 20 minutes of paperwork before the dog is even seen.

She died 5 minutes after getting off the phone.Could have taken her to the emergency vet the night before but I thought her cough occasional cough was from the dryness of the desert. Thought it was not that bad since she was acting like herself, even eating and drinking, otherwise. The next morning i woke up she was gagging and choking clinging to life. The rest was the end.Feel immensely guilty that I may have saved her. I am poor, broke, and cannot even afford to get my remaining dog another companion. All dogs of her size now cost between 3000-5000 and that is two to three months rent I do not have. I cannot get a shelter dog due to my apartment's rules, they have to pass a vet check and extensive behavioral opinion. of the vet. cannot bring home a dog with a questionable background/separation anxiety due to how strict they are. They review and approve everything...Matter of fact I cannot even get a dog from a breeder because my complex needs a full vet exam follower by a 3 business day decision to allow the dog. Most breeders bring a puppy litter for a basic check which is not enough, then you are responsible for the full vet check once in your possession.I feel so depressed because my remaining dog clings to me and will not leave my side.

12523,"I am honestly not doing so fucking hot. I have not been doing so hot for the past 8 months. I really do not know what is going on with me. At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond exhausted. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. Decided to go out of my comfort zone and try out dating, the dude I briefly talked to turned out to also was similar. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS got out of control. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. COVID is still very much flourishing. What are the fucking odds. Every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people in my life, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. I want to move out, but I know that that is going to be financially irresponsible of me. I need to be there for myself, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone. I am so fucking sick of shit, but I have to push through. I am trying so hard to keep a mental grip, but I am so close to just crashing.

When people say they did not see the signs, I wonder if they were blind. I was in a severe mental crisis and my psychiatrist recommended leave - since I know this company will just kick me out, I will just resign. I have not told them yet, I am just trying to regain some strength after having a full on meltdown that led to panic attacks and a near visit to the psych ward.I already attempted suicide once. It was my stepdad and my mom who drove me to the hospital. He was present. All of my family was so supportive afterwards.I guess time fades support. it is been now 3 years since. I have never stopped wanting to kill myself. The only, only reason I have not is my mom. Because I know it would destroy her. So I told myself I would handle anything, any hell that came my way for her. But knowing that my stepfather, who witnessed my attempt, who ""celebrates my second birth"" each year on the date, is now thinking I resign because I am attention seeking is just driving me to a point of no return.Hell, he even saw the cuts in my arm when I came clean about self-harming some weeks ago. What signal do humans need, exactly? Are they blind?They will be back home tomorrow. it is dangerous to be alone. I have every tool at my disposal. I did not really want to go with pills, but right now I am so sad because of his reaction that I am thinking what is the point. what is the point anymore. I am thinking of why does he lie to me. Why does he tell me he thinks of me as his daughter, after 20 years, when I know it is a lie. it is a damn lie, he cares about me just as much as my actual dad does. His feelings are always more important than mine. He has a 32 year old daughter who has not worked a day in her life, a son my age who has not worked a day in his life. I have been spending every year since 18 destroying my mental health to try to gain financial independence. To try to prove somehow that I can, but I cannot. I actually cannot. I enter a job and I try my hardest, and it becomes hell - and I try to stand it, and my health goes in a downward spiral every time.

12543,"This past year and a half have been absolutely terrible for me. I went into college with hope and excitement to finally start my life, only to be kept in my dorm room the entire time and have almost no college experience. Last fall I became depressed and my grades dropped dramatically, but over the winter I got back into school and really brought my grades up. Only to hear on the week of finals that my brother in the Navy, who I had not seen for over two years, passed away. This led to me ultimately failing one of my required classes that I failed in the fall. Over this summer, I worked at appealing my scholarship and taking classes to help boost my GPA. But because my family's expected family contribution was slightly too high, I could not receive the scholarship I desperately need to afford school. The school has not given me any aid or support, and my parents cannot take out a loan. I am having a really difficult time coping with this, and I am having thoughts of considering to just end it. I worked so hard and Covid took so much away from me. I am terrified of even trying to start over because I am afraid I will lose something or someone else important to me. Thanks for reading this. Lost everything I worked for, do not see much of a reason to keep going",Depression
12546,"I do not know if I have any real mental illness since I never have been diagnosed, but ever since my parents got divorced, and my big sibling bellitled me, I always feel very down. I strive to get good grades in school so I can be ""successful"" according to my parents, but now I am thinking that successfulness is not about that, and that it is about happiness. I probably would not be happy working some long job as a hedge fund manager where I get home and barely any time to do anything, so all the money I get would be useless.As days passed my mind keeps telling me more frequently bad things. I tried to kill myself and survived. it is not even what I want to do, because I do not want to go to hell, or be punished , or be in pain, etc, but more and more often, I find myself wanting to hurt myself.Now, most days i do not want to get out of bed and move or do anything. I just want to sink into the bedsheets and then disappear into the ground. Anyone else feel like this? Now, I just feel like lying down on the floor forever",Suicidal
12560,"I met my girlfriend only a little over a week ago at a week long camp. I am 17M and she is 16F, and she lives 2 hours away. we have only been dating for a few days but we have had a lot of long talks and decided this will be worth it. For the past couple days, she is been talking about how horrible her life is and this morning she told me she is trying really hard not to kill herself. I know that she is a gorgeous and intelligent and amazing person and she does not see that, but I do not know how to help her. She said all her life she is wanted was a boyfriend that she can love and be with, and I know that I am not enough being 2 hours away. I have been complementing her and trying to remind her of all the good things in her life, but there is only so much I can do when I am not right next to her. Her parents are strict and they are starting to take her phone and I cannot help but feel like its all my fault. I know that her life would be better right now and her problems would go away if she had never met me, and I really want to be with her and I am here for her on her worst days and her best, but I just want to make sure she is there for her best. I know that the only thing that would hurt her more than her being with me is if I left. I really really like her but its killing me to see her like this and know that I am not a enough of a reason for her to want to live. I am going to keep trying to help her see the best in herself and the world but I do not know how else to help. I do not know how to help my girlfriend",Suicidal
12561,"If you are in a bad headspace please do not read this.I [22M] am slowly starting to give up on life. I hoped things would get better but they have not and do not show any signs of changing. I am currently living at home with my verbally abusive mother in a very toxic environment. I want to move out aspa, but I am working a sh*tty job that does not pay well and if I do save up enough. I would be broke for the foreseeable future. I have seen so many CV councillors and applied to so many jobs, and despite all of that I have not been offered any interviews.To sum up my love life, it has been pain. I have never had a partner or anything like that. Every now and again I match with someone we vibe and hit things off, but after a date or two I get ghosted, leaving me confused and hurt as to why they lost interest. I feel undesirable and unworthy of love. I feel like I need to be perfect in every way order to even be considered as a romatic partner. I feel the same way when it comes to job applications. it is mentally taxing and painful.All of this is having a massive effect on my mental health and I am noticing it deteriorating quickly. I hate that I am thinking about just ending it. But I guess I need to know when to quit, I have struggled with knowing when to quit all my life. I guess I was always the hopeful optimist. But what is the point in trying when put all my efforts in trying to make my life better and I still end up in the same place. I keep telling myself be strong, I hype myself up into a positive mindset and a good mood and for what? Nothing seems to change, well nothing permanent. The cycle continues. It feels like everything is working against me, and simple things that should be straight forward are not.And I get life's not fair and I accept that, but it feels like the difficulty was dailed up to 1000 for me. I do not think anyone can save or help me. I have prayed and begged to whatever cosmic being might be out there. Praying for them to give me a break, give me a win, on which I can build on and make my life better. I do not know what I did to deserve this, whether is this life or past or whatever but I am sorry.I have got so much unresolved pain.I know life has it is rough patches but I would at least like some level of happiness. It seems like life is moving by and I am still trying to fight my demons and move forwards.Honestly I am hesitant to kill myself but at the same time I am looking for a happy accident to relieve me of this pain. All I know is, the longer I stay at home and working at the same job, the closer I am to an early grave.I do not know how anyone would be able to help my situation and I do not know what to expect from writing this Reddit post but I need to let it out. Life is painful and I am tired of fighting",Depression
12569,"I am struggling a lot with my life at the moment. I am 24 and basically just feel very lost / making no progress. I also feel like there is a lot wrong with me, this post will be a ramble.I feel as though my career is moving very slowly. I have a degree, but it is essentially worthless as it is a mediocre grade, and not in a specific area. My current job does not pay very well, and you do not need qualifications to get the position I am currently in. I have tried and failed to get a better paying job, I cannot help but feel that I would have been much better off working straight after finishing school at 16 and working my way up somewhere rather than going to university. Some of my peers have done this and are in a much better place in terms of earnings, house ownership, car etc. than me. I decided to start studying for an extra qualification in my spare time to boost my earnings potential. While I think that this was most likely a good decision, it does feel as though it is not going to get me where I need to be on its own, maybe upping my salary potential by around 5k. it is costing me around 2000 to do, and now that I have been doing it a few months the initial novelty has worn off and it is starting to drain me having to do extra studying after a full day's work, especially with the knowledge that I will most likely have to study a higher qualification on top after completing this one to achieve a decent salary anyway. I have no idea what I want to do in life and never have, I have just taken a route in something that I know I can do easily, and am taking the natural steps to progress. But the whole time I cannot help but feel like I will never find something that I ever really want to do, the only reason I am doing any of this is to earn more money, and the things I am doing are not even a guarantee of that anyway.Currently I live at home with my parents. I am saving up every month for a deposit for a house as I would much rather do that than rent, but the cost of housing is just going up and up, and the salary required to afford a property / mortgage is way above what I am earning. The older I get the more desperate I am getting to move out but it seriously just feels as though it is getting further away rather than closer. I feel like I am just in a hamster wheel and not getting any closer to any of these goals. I do not mind my parents, they are not terrible and living at home does have its benefits, but I am closer to 25 than I am to my 24th birthday now and at this point I am fed up and need my own space. But it just feels as though it is so far away, and even when I try and break it down it just feels like such an impossible task.Mentally I am in a terrible place. I have been for a while, my self esteem is awful, I am really struggling with everything at the moment. I self harm, frequently have depressing thoughts and am just generally unhappy. I suspect I probably have some undiagnosed disorder, when I browse the symptoms of BPD it is like checking off a list. But the process of getting treatment / therapy is incredibly long and expensive, and I honestly have no idea where to start. it is so expensive that I feel seeking out therapy when I have not really experienced anything traumatic enough for it just feels like a waste, and it is going to set back my other financial goals even more. On top of that I am trying to balance studying in my spare time and everything else, I just do not know how I would have the time.Socially I barely have any friends. I would say I have 3 truly good friends, 2 of them live far away so seeing them on a regular basis is not easy, and again is expensive. I only have 1 friend that I can see without travelling at least 90 mins. There is a huge age gap with 90% of my work colleagues. A few months ago my girlfriend broke up with me, which to be honest completely broke me. That relationship was something I thought was truly going well in my life but at some point she decided otherwise, she had her reasons, shit happens. She made clear it was nothing I had done and was not my fault but it is really hard to accept that. I am a lot better now than I was 1-2 months after it happened but it still affects me every day. I have no idea how I am going to trust anyone in the future in terms of a relationship. I also feel as though I am in no state to even be in a relationship anyway having written all the above stuff down. But it is just another thing that gets to me, I feel quite lonely as it is, and she was really good to me and it was a loss of a good friend in a way too. I feel like I am doing something wrong in relationships, I have never had a true, multi year long term relationship. I have no idea what it is about me that is not good enough. I do not pour all my problems out like this to partners. Sometimes it is discussed but I made a point to never burden my ex with all my problems like this. Yet here I am alone anyway. I cannot help but feel there is just some negative aura that people sense and do not want to be around me anymore.After the above happened I tried so hard to get into new stuff. I started doing new hobbies, things that I had not done before. Exercising more than ever before, all the usual things people tell you to do. And it just does not help. I have even been on holiday, which was a welcome distraction, but coming back home and back to reality it just feels as though my life is not going anywhere. The past few days I have just been so deflated. All my usual hobbies no longer interest me, I just have no desire to do anything that I normally do. I do not know enough people and I crave socialising, but if I try going to a club or something I just get so socially awkward / anxious. I am desperately craving some excitement in my life, the only things that are appealing are drinking, which I am really trying to avoid at the moment as it just makes me feel so much worse afterwards. I get tempted by gambling, but even that stops interesting me, unless the amounts are high enough to be risky. But I know I do not have the disposable income to play around with that anyway.I am absolutely sick of social media, I hate it so much. I hate how fake everything is. I deleted the majority of my social media apps. I am completely fed up of the news, it feels like everything you read online is so negative and depressing. And on top of all that like everyone else I am sick to death of covid, that in itself just feels like one step forward, 2 steps back. The government in the UK constantly contradicts and goes back on their own advice. And yet I know even if Covid was gone I would still be in the exact same spot I am now. I feel myself turning bitter and angry at everything which in turn would just make me even worse to be around. Everything is just building up and I have no idea what to do about it, the best way I can describe is I feel like I am playing life on hard mode.Yet there is nothing really wrong with me. Ok maybe I am depressed? But I have no physical disabilities, I have no disease, I have not suffered anything traumatic, I do not have a broken family, I am not stupid, I have a job, I have some qualifications, I have a car, I have some friends. I know I have a lot of things that many people would be grateful for. And yet I cannot help but just feel so *broken*.If anyone's read this far thank you, if anyone decides to share their thoughts thank you even more. Really need to vent, lost in life (long)",Suicidal
12585,"This year I should have been focusing on my thesis. I even got a scholarship for it so I can work on it full-time, before I did it part-time. Before I was very career-oriented + had a lot of gimmicks. But tbh, I felt like I was already at a decline mentally during the past years due to other external events + anxiety. Tbh due to just a string of unfortunate circumstances my grad school academic life was not going the way I hoped.The wrong thing I did is that I got that scholarship during a very bad time in my life. I thought that focusing on one thing would be enough. Basically I could not even remember what I was doing for the past months. I still feel like I am in a groundhog day of sorts tbh. For whatever reason, I cannot wake up when I want to, I cannot sleep, I just get anxiety all the time when I am awake.And the worst of it all is that I cannot get myself to do work or even think about the technicalities of things related to my thesis. Such that I cram things when reporting to my adviser.I have literally developed an anxiety or fear of doing my own work which I actually love.And now I have wasted months which I should have used for developing my thesis proposal.I still have time I suppose. I feel like I could draft one up in a month. Especially since I am in it full-time right now.But fuck it. it is only been this week that I even got a little bit of work done again that is not just due to anxiety-induced clarity of mind that I am forced to cram.So far I am nearing a month of trying to exercise everyday, and eating healthy. It took me this long to finally get my shit together for that.I have been trying to CBT myself for months. And so I have gotten out of that depressive hole at least.This week I am trying to do work little by little. Trying to keep to a schedule. So far I feel like it is working.But fudge how the fuck do I deal with this whole fuck up I did. I do not have papers with my adviser -- I did with previous research projects that are work-related. But really just due to those work project I was full-time in being not handled well by faculty, the papers were not what I hoped them to be.And now I am cramming for a thesis hopefully by the end of December. Worst case, well I am finishing up my thesis late. But dammit I want to publish papers too. I do not want to waste this time/opportunity since if I do not do well with this, I cannot even count a PhD as part of my future. I should have just taken a leave goddamit. it is understandable this pandemic --- is still very shitty at my country. But I went and got a scholarship that ties me in the whole thing.I cannot even get recommendation letters from my previous work projects because I left them due to their issues --- it was outrageous. It really is, friends told me I got an unlucky streak and they agree that they really were shit. Well there is 1 that went well. But that is just 1! So all I am hoping is to get a recommendation letter in the future from my current adviser. And here I am messing up things.I feel like I still can do something about this. Because moving forward and all that.And I feel like my adviser has a feel for how some of us advisees of theirs are not doing well mentally. Because we do not follow up with him. And we just basically disappeared at times. And he does not call us out on it so far. He just accepts and deals with whatever we report when we talk to him.Honestly I felt like he should have kicked me out months ago.But the thing is, despite all things. I have smiling depression. And have been in and out of this for years. My therapist tells me I should get tested for ADHD, but honestly right now in my country it is a bit difficult to get diagnosed for it. She told me meds may help me.The issue with this is, people around me likely think that all is ok. They think I am upbeat. So in all effect I look like a slob or have no concept of time or really just threw away my thesis.But the thing is I actually really tried to get to it everyday. Honestly I still have to do some work from another thing and I am putting that off as well. Trying to wake up everyday and sitting in front of my computer.Doing nothing but my mind is on the thing. And time flies by.And shit.So yeah this long rant. I just do not see how I can get over this whole thing even if I get over my work anxiety. Is it all for naught? :(((**TLDR: I feel like I should just move on and try to do what I should do. But I cannot help but not know how to deal with the fact that I wasted months during grad school + when I fucking to a scholarship. I should have taken a leave of absence instead. Logically I know that there are some things that one should just move on from. And just deal with it and move on. At this point accept that shit happened, and try to do what I can. But how to deal with the whole mess up and how I obviously have to make a good impression. Where even right now, I am still struggling with getting my self to work due to developed ergophobia. --- Obviously step by step for this one. But dammit I cry. apologies for this long post. T-T** How do I get over the wasted time I did during grad school due to depression/anxiety?",Depression
12589,"I do not know when it started but I found out that my father and all of my relatives in his side do not believe in mental illnesses. It was in 8th grade when I started showing signs of depression and I got into this ""rebellious"" phase, this is also where he started texting me how he will beat me and wished that I was never his daughter because I was not normal. He was not in the country at that time so he was not able to touch me. I never told my mother, I felt like nobody could not accept me and it affected my performance in school and my relationship with other people.Fast forward, at the beginning of my time as in 11th grade, I was diagnosed with depression and I even had to lie to some of the doctor's questions so that the results will not be worse. I was given a letter to see a Psychiatrist and now I am about to start college and I still never went. I still remember how my father threatened to beat me and make sure that almost all of my teeth fell off if he finds out that I have not been acting like a ""normal teenager""I had a fight with him again this quarantine and even though I am agnostic, that night I thanked God because he was not in the country and he was not able to hurt me. He kept saying that I was a mistake and an embarrassment. Everyone in the family just excused it as his ""way of saying he loves me"" because he just ""wants the best for me"" and it is just because of ""high blood that he could not control what he says""I want to run away. I hate everyone in this house. And even though that my mother is the only reason I am living, I hate her the most for letting him treat me like this. For a woman who showed me how strong she was by not relying on my father's money and embodied independence, she is the weakest person ever.Until this day, I have never heard an apology from him. Only material gifts which was his way of saying ""you cannot hate me, I bought you this expensive item""He poured his money on me while I was growing up and I hated myself for that because now I cannot even stand up alone in the outside world now without finding them and relying on their ""help""I am such a failure Parents that do not believe in mental illnesses",Depression
12590,"Its just a dice roll on how I am going to feel that day, its either good, meh, or terrible, and I am having a lot less of the good and more of the meh, but no matter how I feel that day the thoughts of insignificance, life having no meaning, not knowing what I want to do with my life, feeling like I am wasting my life are always there. I fucking hate it, I know life can be beautiful and fun and Its not like I do not experience that and enjoy the day to day now and then but most of the time I just feel crushed and defeated and lost and hopeless. Its just the same thing day in and day out and I do not have the motivation or drive to do anything other than sit around and watch tv. My interests, hobbies, passions are all still there I just do not have the motivation to care for them, sometimes they feel boring even when I wanted to do them. Not wanting to exist is just a normal for me now, but even that feels wrong, I know I want to be here and get better but sometimes it does not even feel like the depression it just feels like waking up to the shitty reality of the world. Every means of survival has been monetized, working an 8hour desk job is the only way to feasibly survive for 99% of people, the state of the country is shit, the state of the world is shit, the world might not even be livable in 100 years. I just want to be able to wake up with something to live for besides the possibility of it all getting better because that is the only thing keeping me moving. I do not know how long I have been living with whatever form of mental illness I have got going on but last October is when it started getting bad and now its unbearable. And I hate to say this decline happened during Covid because it feels like it invalidates how I am feeling, you know everyone is going through the same thing, its just the pandemic, and all of the other BS.

12591,"I am not sure where to start. November of 2020, I moved across the country with my boyfriend, who four months later died of an accidental overdose. I decided to move back home after where my support system is at. Its been 4 months since he has passed away, since I have been home with my parents. I am just dealing with grief and depression. I decided to start taking Lexapro, which has helped to deal with the tremendous amount of suffering. I am 26, and I lack so much purpose. I do not have a career, I do not have a job, I am living at home, and every day I tell myself Ill do something different today and sure enough, just fall back into my same bad habits. I started smoking cigarettes which are not even my thing, and I told myself I would not drink anymore since he passed, but now I see myself start drinking a glass or two of wine a night. I am just so depressed and stuck. I want to run away to somewhere new, but I know the same problems will follow. I want to go back to school, but then I just do not even follow through. I am just so lost feeling, and I am scared to be stuck in a position for too long. I keep living in the past of the mistakes I made with my boyfriend. I know I am battling depression.

12601,"I (17NB) have been dealing with depression and anxiety for the past 5 years. At the end of this school year, I thought I was finally cured; I thought I found my purpose, rediscovered hope, and made really good friends. That all came crashing down when a relative passed away due to the current worldwide issue. For the past two weeks I have been feeling the worst I have felt in a long time. The relative who had passed away was not very close to me herself, but her passing changed my parents and turned them verbally abusive and now I hide in my room all day to avoid talking to them so I do not get screamed at for the most mundane reasons. Along with night terrors which I have been dealing with for months, I have been crying daily, and have been not letting myself sleep and isolating myself from many of my friends as a form of sh since my mother checks my skin daily. Moreover, I did not even notice at first but I started restricting and then binging and this style of eating mixed with my lack of sleep and anxiety about my home life landed me in the hospital for newly developed health issue.Anyways, I have started trying to manage my issues. I set controls on all my devices so that they do not let me use any apps from 11 pm to 7 am, and I have also been making myself eat 5 really small meals per day so I can keep everything down while eating enough. The only issue I have been having is reaching out to my friends again. I am in the Bay Area, and restrictions are easing despite the increasing cases and new strain concerns. I managed to open myself and my issues to a really understanding friend of mine, and he invited me to go to SFO with this group of friends, and while I am glad to have been invited, this trip is causing me so much anxiety and I really need an outsider's opinion.On one hand, I really want to go. I have not been around people in so long and I feel like if I do not talk to someone who is not in my family I might explode. On the other hand, while this friend group has been nothing but nice to me, they make me nervous. Like, I am not a very popular person at school; I have been kind of bullied up until like last year. This changed when I made friends with this group, who is very well-known and quite popular, and people started treating me better. While they are all very nice, I feel insecure when hanging out with them because they have always been more popular, more attractive, and they are super close with each other so they make inside jokes and reference past trips they have made while I feel left out. Once they even forget that I am with them and did not include me in a conversation for almost 3 hours. I feel like if I do not go, I am going to feel depressed and horrible that I did not go on a fun trip as teen that I can talk about once school starts and I am going to feel jealous they got to bond without me. But if I do go, and they all have a lot of fun while I am trying to keep up with the convo, I think I might burst into tears on the spot.Then there is also the fact that my parents will not let me go at all, first of all because of increasing cases in the area and the new strain, but also because of my health issues mentioned above. I know this seems like a super first-world and stupid problem but all these issues colliding into this one weekend trip is causing me severe anxiety and I feel unable to think. What should I do?tldr: dealing with probably my lowest point, trying to get better, invited on a trip with sort-of friends, idk whether I should go or not due to mental and physical health issues as well as worldwide issues. (tw grief,slight sh, ED) It keeps coming back and never ends-- advice would be appreciated",Depression

I have a chronic depression which I am trying my absolute best to deal with.there is a thing that is messing things up for me and I hope you guys have some advice on that and/or want to share your similar experiences.

I know lots of small and bigger activities to do but my body just does not want to, in my mind I want to because I know it will be better to be distract myself. Whenever I have 30 (sometimes even less) minutes time which I am not doing anything I go in a state of apathy which results in making it waaay harder to do stuff and most of the time result in doing nothing or just watching Netflix or some other brainless things.

I am not going to day the word but if you can all work out what they think i tried to do then you know,Yes I understand what it looks like but instead of trying to help me they have tried to incriminate me, my family have no idea what is going on with me either, I feel so lost in this world bullied by the system and now I am probably going to be facing some serious charges because I tried to take my own life, yes I know what it looks like going to a specific building with no suicide note looks abit fishy to the authorities, but I have only just realised that this is FUCKED!I am not a bad person and I know that but I cannot go from here they say its for my mental health but I know they are building a case.Bro I tried taking my life the other day got rushed to the best hospital in the city got treated within 5 mins like I am somebody they want to keep alive it do not work like that here in England especially with the state the NHS is inIM SO SCARED FUCK THE SYSTEM Been set up by undercover police after my suicide attempt FUCK THE SYSTEM !",Suicidal
12634,"There are a number of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques that I have found helpful for myself including Spielmans 3-P model, which helps explain depression and anxiety. It says that there are 3 main factors that come together to create a chronic illness (like depression or anxiety disorders). The first is predisposing factors. Predisposing factors are things like genetics or cultural/family attitudes and they are generally out of our control. Predisposing factors increase our chance of developing the symptoms of a chronic issue (if the other two factors are also present). The next is precipitating factors (or triggers) which lead to the manifestation of the symptoms (in your case maybe the panic attack at 13). Precipitating factors are usually traumatic experiences. In order for the illness to become chronic, there generally needs to be perpetuating factors as well. Perpetuating factors are thoughts or behaviors which often initially arose to help you cope with the symptoms, but now are causing the issue to continue. Behavioral activation is a specific type of CBT for depression that helps you identify what your perpetuating behaviors may be and take concrete steps to stop engaging in those behaviors. An example of one of my own perpetuating factors for depression was isolating myself/not leaving the house. In many cases this urge to isolate arose out of mental fatigue or to avoid anxiety provoking situations. But in the long run, too much isolation worsened my depression because I ended up cutting myself off from the people, activities, and outside information (outside of my own brain) that helped me regulate my emotions and feel more pleasure/joy. Changing a perpetuating behavior once you have identified it takes patience and coping skills. Coping skills help you cope with the uncomfortable emotions that come up in a way that does not perpetuate the problem. It was hard for me to get myself to do the therapy (especially in the beginning) but I can tell it has really rewired my brain in a way that makes life feel more pleasant. I am sorry about your suffering and I hope you find a way to feel better soon. CBT principles that I have found helpful",Depression
12635,"I am not scared of death, I want it, but I want it to happen like a car crash, hit by a bus, building falling on me. A way that does not i valve me doing it to myself... but lately, driving to and from work, all I can picture is flooring it into any tree, pole, body of water that I see. I entertain the thought every day now. I have not been this bad since I was in middle/high school. All my life I have been winging it because I did not think I would live this long. I wish I did not live this long, I cannot imagine living any longer. Its so hard for me to wrap my head around the idea of living a full life. Day after day. Heartbreak, illness, tragedy, natural disasters, wars. With the exception of a few good moment far in between. I cannot understand how that is worth it to anyone, but I guess I am not like anyone. Never have been. I am too self-aware to live in this world with the thoughts and abilities of observation that I have. I know when people do not like me, I know when I am being annoying, I know I am not pleasing to the eyes and hearts of those around me. They will not verbally say it, but I can read their body language. I can read through the tone of voice or messages. I can tell when everyone who I ever cared about has done me wrong. Especially lately. I cannot blame them. I do not like me either, I do not like how I look, sound, or act. I do not have a personality of my own. I merge. I blend. Or I just occupy a space. I can provide acts of service and endearment, but I am rarely able to connect. Or they cannot seem to connect with me. I used to be funnier, but in an immature freshman kind of humor that is not appropriate today. Now, I do not know anything it seem My brain cannot consume, resonate, or learn new information. It does not stick. Its not advanced like everyone else. I hate to ask questions because no matter what, I will not retain it. I am defective. My self imagine is lower than the floor, its in hell. Growing up being told I will one day blossom like a flower or go from being an ugly ducklong to a beautiful swan was hopeful.. but that day never came. I can make a list as long as a CVS receipt on all the things I hate about my appearance alone. Looking in the mirror is exhausting. Recently had a great friend do a photoshoot of me, I felt confident in the moment, but as soon as I saw the pictures... I loathed myself even more. she is a brilliant photographer with skills. I wish I could have enjoyed them as much as she did. My motivation of anything disappeared a long time ago. I used to draw, fish, play games, hang out with old friends all the time. have not been able to enjoy anything outside of mindless phone games. The friends i used to have, who I thought were my friends... all moved away. I should not be sad about it. They moved a long time ago and they were not nice to me behind my back, but that was when I had the most joy. We were inseparable, going on adventures... then after they moved, I reconnected with another friend who I thought was different.. turned out to be same. I have realized that I have always been the ugly weird friend people drag along to uplift their image and status. Those who I do or did connect with, they are excelling, moving forward with their own lives. I cannot relate to them because I am way back in the line. I do not want to block their way. New relationships, kids, work. I am so happy for them and wholeheartedly wish them the best. For my own relationships... 2 serious ones. First one was a dream come true. Everything I could ask for until it was not. I was at a point where I was moving forward and they were too, but in a very different sense.. I wish them the best and I wish I could take back some words. Now in my current one... if I even could say its currently happening.. 5 years. 5 years of what seemed to be my forever... until it was not, it might still be, but any outside perspective would tell me to run. We managed to get our first apartment, taught me how to drive, got a cat.. all the great milestones. Until it they decided it was not what they wanted anymore by communicating with their ex again. Since then, its been back and forth. My fault, continues to be my fault for staying. I do not even care anymore because I love them. I do not want anyone else. I also know when they leave for good... that will be the end times for me. One of the last threads that has been keeping here. it is fucked up, but that is my reality. Though, it brings me back to wanting it to end in a freak accident rather than myself because I do not want that burden on my parents. That was, still is another waiting period, if all else fails, I will wait until they pass. All I really know, is that I was not made to be here. I have no purpose in this world if all I do is sit and suffer. Repeatedly get hurt, especially on purpose. No personality that could allow new interactions, even then, I already know what the outcome of those would be. Its a cycle of non stop reminders that I have no worth, no value, no point in existing. I would much rather be in eternal slumber than existing agony. What is the point for me",Suicidal
12637,"TW: (SELF HARM) Last night, one of my cousins, who I am very close with, told me she needed to tell me something important. She told me I could not tell anyone, and that she is been going through a tough time and working on this issue by herself. I was anxious to hear what she said, and then she sent me pictures of her wrist all slit up. I was at lost for words. I truly did not know what to say. I have been on this boat and still did not know how to help her. I told her to speak to me on what is going on, and also speak to her counselor in college. I also recommended her to a tele-psychiatrist who could speak to her and prescribe her affordable medication without insurance, so that know one would know. I offered to pay for it too. (Our family is not too supportive on mental health).Its upsetting and I wish I could help more. She lives in a different state and I just do not know what to do. I love my little cousin and too lose her would be too much on my heart. Did I do the right thing? Medications were not too helpful for me but they got me through, so maybe it was not that helpful? I am still in shock and not sure what else to say to her. Maybe I should have said something else. I just want to help. My cousin sent me a picture of her wrist.",Depression
12643,"I am going to put this here since I got no one else to tell. The past 2 months my mental health has completely crumbled. My friends did not reach out to me, I always had to reach out to them. It was just really obvious these past 2 months that they do not care, never did they reach out and even ask if I was okay. Just nothing. The fact that I am a lonely loser just amplified itself these past 2 months.I always thought that reaching out to a friend that you think is having a bad day was normal. My friends all knew I have depression and yet not one message of comfort was sent to me. Friends were always important to me my whole life but now that I am experiencing life after school, everything just feels so hopeless. I am stuck with depression and it feels like no matter what I do, I cannot just get rid of it. My friends always said to improve myself and whatnot, if it was that simple then I would not be this depressed and suicidal.I just felt so lonely these past 2 months. After I reached out one last time to one of my friends, he said the reason they do not reach out and check up on me is that ""we are adults now"". After he said I should just toughen up. Those words have been stuck in my head the past week. I do not know what is right or wrong anymore but what I do know is that I want to move on, I simply do not want to live anymore.Just then I removed them all from my social medias and friends lists. The amount of pain I went through my life just outweighs any good that happened. I never had a girlfriend at all and the fear of being lonely forever is eating away at me. Seeing that those friends do not care enough just made me more and more depressed by the day. Being told to toughen up is just bullshit. All these bullshit excuses and words they tell me, I just had enough of.I just hate everything, I cared so much for my friends and the care just was not returned. Anyways guys, I am probably not going to post again and honestly I feel extremely suicidal right now so this might be my last post on Reddit. Sick of it all",Depression
12648,"For the last few months I have been feeling less and less powerful emotions. I do not feel genuine. Every time I talk to someone else, it feels like an act. I just go with the flow of the schedule my mother made for me. Wake up, take the dog for a walk, sit down to study, eat, go out for a jog, study more and sleep. I used to play some games and cube but I do not find any joy in those things anymore.And now for the last couple of weeks I feel like I spend every moment of my conscious day about falling off a building. I go through the day on autopilot with the thought of the wind rushing all over my body in the foreground of my thoughts.I had a girlfriend and a few friends before I started losing interest in interacting with others as it felt taxing and just boring. Slowly my interactions with them stopped.I do not even feel horny anymore, jacking off feels like just another task to do in the morning. I used to find people attractive but now everyone looks the same. I still try to act like a nice person when online because I thought that the whole happiness multiplies by sharing it had some weight to it but it does nothing for me.I have this empty feeling in my gut all the time. I try to ignore it by studying the whole day but it just does not stop.My father fucking hates me now after I told him about this, my mother is acting like I never told her about this.I tried to make myself happy by taking a couple of days to just do the things that made me happy but they feel like chores I imposed on myself.I just fucking hate that I spend every day thinking about falling but do not have the guts to really do it. I always feel at the verge of crying but can never cry. I feel like I am not a person any more.",Suicidal
12649,"When I say casually, I do not mean kind of, or just a little bit, or has thoughts, but does not plan on acting. My friend actually has a situation that I cannot find one other post similar to anywhere on Reddit. My friend is not afraid of death or suicide. They are not terribly depressed, according to them. They just would rather have nothing than something. There is no intensity in their emotions when talking about this. They feel that they have the right to not play the game of life. Life and losing life both have very little weight to them. Their potential suicide is not a big deal to them. They do not think they should be responsible for the people that their death hurts because they were not responsible for being born so, again, they say they have the right to end themselves. I did not ask to come here so I should be allowed to leave. We are both in our 20s.All the things I have tried to say just seem to not make any dent in their thoughts. It seems to be something not worth thinking too deeply about for them. Has anyone been in a situation like this? Any advice for me to stop him? My friend is casually suicidal, for lack of a better term. Is there anything I can do?",Suicidal
12650,"So what even is the point of living for 60 more years of this bullshit? How I am I suppose to last atleast 40 more years of these same thought I been having for 3 years?? Nothing changes or helps so what the fuck I am a suppose to do??Everyone tells me the same bullshit advice I am tired of it like its all a lie.- Life gets better- got to keep pushing thru- People care about you- Your usefull and talented- that is selfish of you if you do- You need to find hobbies- Go out and explore life- Everyone hates life and working- Everyone has to put up with life- do not give up, something well get better- You have a bright future ahead of you- You need help- Get on meds and a therapist- You need to grow upBut how I am I suppose to change all this when all my thoughts and everything I do I the opposite of these people? They do not seem to understand I hate life and I do not see anything in my future or nor do I give a fuck lol.. Why do I even live? Everyday I tell myself I should just do it the past 2 years I think about killing myself everyday. Honestly I do not see a point in living, life is so boring to me even tho I have everything I want already and it still sucks lol.",Suicidal
12654,"I posted on other sub as well, not fishing for anything just want to vent that is all.I am a lame and an ugly dude. Someone i knew once told me that i got a head that only a mother could love. Another one told me that I am lucky that i am a boy cuz no one would marry me if i were a girl. I rarely had any luck with girls. When i go out with my friend girls always fancy him. I never get any attention. Throughout my 24 years on this earth, i can only think of three girls who were interested in me. One made out with me but stop halfway because I was inexperienced in kissing. The other two exchanged numbers but they never wanted to go out with me. The only thing i got going on in my life is my job as a mechanical engineer and potential inheritance from my parents. Everyday is sadness fest for me. I feel lonely. I always wonder what is it like to be in a relationship, to have friends to talk to, weekend plans to look forward to. I never look forward to going home after work instead i burry my sorrows with overtime. I want to have friends to go to festivals with. what is stopping me from achieving all of the things i listed, are my insecurities about my look, my lack of social skills due to years of oppression during my childhood, my social anxiety and my looping depression.How can my life get better if i get nervous when talking people ? How can my hope to meet a romantic partner be actualised when I do not have the social skills ?How can develop my social skills when i get social anxiety when i am in a social setting ?I do not see a way out of this beside death, and a really optimistic belief that i will go to heaven or reborn again as a penguin (cuz they are cute).My constant suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger everyday and I have no one to talk too. This is my first time posting my feeling out in public, I do not expect anything in return. I just want to vent out..I do not want to die but the pain is too hard to handle. I am so done, but am I ready to end it ????",Depression
12655,"I cannot stop cutting really badly, I made a huge gaping one about an hour ago that extends from one end of my arm to the other end and I have hastily half glued half stitched it up. I keep saying this but it keeps happening...""this one is the worst so far""Like... To think before a few months ago I had not done it past cat scratches and now I am going super overboard... I burned myself for the first time like last week, I do not understand how I have gotten it this bad, and the worse I do it the worse I feel like I need to do it next time, I am having dreams that I am cutting arms off. I have had 4 attempts on my life this year and I feel like only one time I was not fully serious about it, the other three times were serious attempts and the feeling afterwards is so shameful, and embarrassing.How do I get the nasty voice out of my head telling me to keep trying to die? it is not always there but when it comes I cannot get out of it, I do not end up feeling sad, just numb... And then I do something really dangerous. Is it because I have made it a self fulfilling prophecy to not live to see next year? How much longer do I have to cry every day? I had a therapist come over today but it was really weird because we could not hear each other properly through our masks. Self harm/suicide vent",Depression
12656,"I(18 yrs. old, M) started feeling this kind of feeling when I was in Junior High School. Every time a certain part of life gets harder, I lose my motivation to accomplish and I am having self-doubts if it is actually worth it to waste my energy to complete something. I feel like I cannot achieve my dreams. its hard to appreciate life and enjoy living.I am Obese, Shy, Insecure and Always Anxious. I noticed that I am easily irritable as the years go by. I will be become a Freshman College student this school year and I am so worried about my future. Its getting hard to wake up. I wish that I could sleep forever, so that I could never worry about the future and responsibilities. Responsibilities. Whenever I was given a hard responsibility, it is hard to meet their expectations. It stresses both my body and mind. Ever since I started feeling unmotivated and depressed, I just let myself go with the flow. The concept of love and romance to me is....nothing. I just..do not care about making a relationships anymore. The feeling of being myself alone is just what keeps me going. I am always having thoughts about why am I still alive?, suicide, someone/something killing me, accidents that will kill me, anything that will kill me. I am always begging to GOD to ""just take me already"" whenever I was having a mental breakdown due to stress, how people( like my parents) are disappointed to me, making a mistake(even a small one). I am so afraid of failing. Every I time i fail, i feel unmotivated, apathetic to anything.The only things that keep me going are surfing the internet, playing games, listening to music and reading books. I hate reading books when I was a kid but during Junior high school, I come to appreciate how fantasy books are. Fantasy Books gives me a feeling of freedom. Whenever I read these kind of books, I always insert myself as the MC, thinking what would if I was the MC. The only things that are interesting to me are entertaining video(I always stream on YouTube), fantasy books(mostly isekais, light-novels). i always wished that the our VR Technology would advance just like Sword Art Online. Create worlds that I want to live in.How to get rid of this feeling? How do I motivate myself to keep on going? How do i get motivation for pursuing my dreams?&amp;#x200B; (Sorry for grammar issues, English is not my native language. This is my first time in Reddit.)

12659,"I have been completely sober for 12 days now. no weed, no alcohol, no nicotine. (and no porn)and while its been one of the hardest things for me to do, i think its helping. it forces me to deal with the heavy emptiness i feel inside head on. and the pain has been getting so bad that its forcing me to do things, just anything to deal with it. like working out a little, playing video games, music, and even talking to my self, in depth, about how terrible i feel all the time.and I have been getting better.i never felt so hopeless that i have for the past 3 years of my life and I have felt like I have stared into the abyss and what I have seen could not be unseen.and while I am still *far* from doing good,i am considerably better, and i plan to continue.2 things i want to touch on that have been good for me.1, is videogames.i used to LOVE playing games, but these past few years, they have felt more like chores than fun. more distraction than happiness. but the fact that i am actively playing again and even getting a bit excited about the games I am playing and going to play is HUGE for me.2 is talking to myself.I have been going through a major existential crisis for a while now that has been getting worse and worse to the point where i felt like all words were nothing but meaningless lies in a sad attempt to make us feel better in an endless pit of chaos that is our reality.but I have gotten to the point where even if that is true, i do not care anymore. atleast not as much. and I have been talking as though i were my own therapist, and going in depth about how i feel, memories i have, dreams, ect, so forth. and I have had 3 emotional breakdowns in the past week and a half. each one filled with tears.and i seriously think its helping.I am still trying to get my passion for music back, but I am listening more actively and even finding myself enjoying music again time from time.you guys have no idea how much that means for me. anyways, i just wanted to share, i diddnt know where else to. and i hope this can serve as a beacon for anyone who feels lost, because trust me.. i get it. i may not understand your specific pain, but i do understand pain. and hopelessness. and feeling like you are in an inescapable prison filled with insanity that feeds it self endlessly. maybe there is hope. &lt;3 feeling hopeful again",Suicidal
12660,"I have been suicidal since I was 17. I was miserable. Always drinking, self harming, never being honest with my family or friends and always unhappy. They all found out eventually because I had to stay at a psych ward for 2 weeks in 2017. Fast forward to present day, I meet the most incredible human being ever. We worked together, and became friends. He understood me, asked questions about my feelings, stayed on the phone with me for hours late at night, until 5 or 6am some nights. When I was talking or hanging out with him, I had no worries and I was the happiest I have been since going to Disneyland when I was a kid.Only problem is, I started to fall in love. He is taken, so I kept it to myself. I tried to get over it and just be friends. Sometimes it would be worth it and other times it would hurt but I stuck through the pain because he is too important to lose. I do not talk to my family or any other friends like that. I have tried. Hes the only one I got besides my therapist. It got to be too much one night and I ended up confessing my feelings. He said we could still be friends. That was a week ago, and he will not reply to any of my texts or calls. I am torn between giving him space and trying to fix this but it seems like he just needs time. I have been doing everything I can to distract myself. I feel empty. I cannot do this without him. A part of me is missing. I have barely spoke since this happened. I drink all the time, smoking non stop. Anything to make me forget that I might have just fucked up the best thing for me. I cannot stop thinking about all the memories we were going to share.

An acceptance. A knowing: this is what life is, this is what people are like, this is your life. Meaningless receptor of pain.

Par for the course of my entire life she named me in the second group.

I must admit that before all of this happened I had a tiny sliver of hope she might fancy me since we get along incredibly well.Now before any of you think of calling her a bitch, she really is not.

I cannot remember all of them but here is some major ones -Said he feels the need to cheat on me because I am so worried about it-Told me to go get a hobby for worrying about our relationship -Made fun of my body -Gets mad when I tell him about something I do not like that he does but hell turn around and tell me how much he wants to know about those things And well ofc as I said, a lot more. However, those are the main onesHe came and told me our relationship was only sexual attraction and not romantic attention for him, which obviously I was sad. who is going to be leaping with joy when they hat they are partner is questioning if they are aromantic? Especially as someone who is on the asexual spectrum MAINLY BECAUSE of a history with sexual assault. We are also fucking minors dude we are not going to be fucking I have not broken up with him yet, my mom tried to get me too since for one, my mental health is shit and two, I need to pull myself together and mature more.However I almost have a few times. One time being because I was going about to go to a psych ward, I never ended up doing either obviously. I cannot bring myself to break up with him, I feel bad.

12683,"So I have been struggling with depression/suicidal thoughts lately. that is a whole different conversation. But about 4 days ago, my dad called me and asked if I was in town for the weekend (I moved to a new state for better life for my kids). I said no its just the wife and kids. He proceeds to says tuff like ""well things are going to get better man do not worry."" But then he completely stabs me in the back. The only 2 people in this world I trust in life were my wife and my dad.... My wife calls me yesterday crying her eyes out and as I try to calm her down, she tells me that my dad had come on to her very very hard. He had told her of dreams and fantasies and that he can ""tell she needs to explore a bit"" and ""i can tell we are both intimate people"" and if you ever feel the need to cheat, just know I am a safe place to go for that"". My wife asked me not to react and say anything to him. Which is very very hard, because it hurts bad. I am kind of numb and just do not really know how to act. I cannot trust him around my little girl now because I am scared if he would do that to me what else would he try. And I do not have people to talk to so i ran to reddit to get it out of my head.

My mother us very loving, have had (absent/alcoholic father). For a bit over a year have been in a healthy relationship with someone I love. I am smart, pretty and supported (while also seeing a therapist) . However, I have thought about committing suicide on and off for the past 5 years. My mothers father hung himself when I was 12, I know my mother would be heartbroken if anything were to happen to me. that is why I have not taken the plunge to do it. Some days are good, some are bad, some are unbearable. And I say this because I was born with a disability, which I am coming to terms with. Its my own personal touch on a flaw, but it makes me wonder why I survived in the first place (the only successful pregnancy out of four for my mother who miscarried) . I know I was a wanted child, but I feel like, in the world we live in today, that is no place to raise a child in all aspects of it. No one asked me if I wanted to come into the world, I am miserable, upset and disgusted. At the same time, what is there to live for? These thoughts will not stop.

12692,"I had my daughter 9 weeks early 8 weeks ago from preeclampsia. I found out this week that my boyfriend (her father) has been cheating on me the entire year we have been together. I found out by seeing a picture of his ex blowing him. They had been doing stuff for a month. She is now pregnant and does not know who the dad is, but it could be him, even though he has fertility issues and it took us months of trying with doctors help to conceive our daughter, and him and that ex had tried for 2 years and it never happened. he is the first and only person I ever wanted a child and to get married with. I met him when I was only a few weeks away from carrying out my first attempt (which I ended up not doing), after ending a 10 year abusive relationship with an addict. I have bipolar disorder and was recently diagnosed with post partum depression.

My life was finally getting better and suddenly, I am self harming and starving myself and nonstop thinking about suicide. My daughter is the only reason I have not yet, but it is early enough she would not notice I was gone and could have a better mother, who actually deserves to love her.

12695,"I have been depressed for as long as I can remember. I also have severe anxiety. I feel out of control right now. The intrusive dark thoughts are eating me up and I do not know what to do. I do not know what approach to take. I am scared to give medications a chance because back in 2013 I went through a very low point and was prescribed xanax. I took xanax everyday for three years. At first it helped. It really did. It helped me get out of the ditch I was in but as you all know, Xanax is a short term drug. I became dependent on it rather quickly. Weaning myself off of it was the best and hardest thing I had ever done. I was also prescribed Lexapro. I took it one day and a couple hours later I was a wreck. Dizzy like you would not believe. I could even stand. I had to miss work. I gave it up after that. Ever since then I have not been on a single drug. I also did not have health insurance so there is that too. I am in a better position now, though. I have health insurance. I am working a full time job. Things are better. But I cannot shake how I feel. It has been so bad lately and I cannot breathe. Life should not be this way. I should not wake up and immediately think of negative things. Hateful, dark thoughts. Its miserable. I am constantly anxious. My heart is always racing. I am uncomfortable in my own skin. I have slowly become scared to leave the house. I need to think about it and prep myself beforehand. Its exhausting.I guess my question is what steps should I take?

12697,"So on Monday (posting on Thursday) I (17F) got in a minor car wreck, which totaled my SUV. I got hit from the rear drivers side going about 55 mph. It happened really quick and early in the morning, so I barely understood what was going on. I had a lot of stuff that was illegal in my state in the back of my car. If it was not for my bf (17M) who got everything out on time, I would be sitting in prison right now. the worst thing about having a habit like mine is that I get careless with it. I smoke in my car, nobody else drove my car so why the fuck not, right? I have on/off relationship with my parents because of the kid I was before. But the most recent fuck up I tried to correct was that I ate a couple pieces of candy before my car wreck. They drug tested me immediately after I wrecked. No doctors office or anything but my therapists office at 7am. I hate to admit it but I was hurting so bad with a concussion that I let into her and cussed her that she cried a couple times. Their immediate reaction to my first bad accident was to send me back to rehab. It was on their immediate agenda. I do not even want to touch on how the last trip went. However, when i realized that is what they were doing, I started packing my bag and moving out to live with my bf. I thought it was the safest option for me to go back to school without me going back to rehab. It was just crazy how I never stopped using when I got out, I picked back up within the first week. My parents did not know and they said I changed for the better, but in reality I never really changed. I was still smoking, but getting my shit together. They just did not notice. I am starting to regret moving out. The toxic household I lived in with my narc mom before this really shaped me to love her despite her low moments. I did not realize until it was too late that moments we had were not really good. My dad (who has since been separated from my mom) agreed that my mom showed him narc behavior and that he supports me moving out. I have been fighting a whole lot more recently with my bf. Its getting harder for me to find reasons why I left. He reminds me every day but its starting to feel as if I jumped the gun. I could have spent a little longer at home.

But nevertheless, the same trials and tribulations go on anywhere. But being said, everything in this post is tailored to the city that I live in.But what happened? It is so difficult to meet anybody anymore. Older women, like women my age, they are broken, bruised, jaded, and fed up because they are approached by pieces of garbage constantly. he is gotten to the point where I cannot even make eye contact with a woman when I am walking past her on a sidewalk. They literally look down or look away because they are tired of being approached. Also the guide to girl ratio here is out of control. there is got to be at least 10 guys for every woman that is available. Then you factor in everything from the unique primal intrigue that flows through the veins of any human being in this city, and again, it is impossible. Within this gigantic sea of terrible men, there are few Good Men drowning, not even being thrown a life preserver. it is a shame. it is a waste of time, energy, good souls, and the possibility of memorable love.

Even the caliber of personality shared with most women in this city has gotten more judgmental and aggressive. Most of the women that are younger, they want money. They want a sugar daddy without realizing that we just came through a pandemic where most people are not as flush with cash anymore due to inflation.Then you have a lot of left-leaning liberal women who will not even talk to a person who is a centrist. Since when did politics have to play a huge role in dating? In the worst of it is, the vaccine. If you did not get a vaccine, you are basically a piece of shit to everyone who did. And I thought there was a law in place that protected your personal medical privacy. What do I know.What I do know is all of it makes me so depressed and feel so lonely.

It is the laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, revisiting memories that inflict hurt and pain, and not being able to stop.

It is the zoning back in after and realising that my suicidal thoughts, so frequent, can devour my mind entirely at any time.

12722,"TL;DR: I wasted the majority of my life playing video games. I survived Junior and Senior grades but retained nothing and had no idea what career to follow. So, I took a year off pre-college to make things right, only to find that there is a lot to make right, and I am running out of time. What should I do?Hi, I am Dilan Zelsky, an 18-year-old Uruguayan female trapped in the body of a male monster and a failure.I am from a somewhat poor family. My parents never went to college and were in a worse situation than I am in terms of economy and resources, so only my father works, and what he earns only suffices for food, bills, and a few other things.I never accomplished anything in my life. Gaming took all of my life and prevented me from doing many things that I wanted to do, such as developing video games, writing fiction, drawing, starting a blog, playing instruments, and more.When Junior grade came, I had to choose the path to what career I wanted to pursue. I chose Engineering out of discouragement from the other options, but not because I wanted to have anything to do with it.The junior grade was difficult to the point that I quit gaming. By the end of the year, gaming felt alien to me, and all I could think of was studying.After the rough school year I had, I decided to spend my summer studying for Senior grade. I did not get far because I was a poor learner, but I discovered the College Info Geek blog. While the blog barely helped me, it was my gateway to non-fiction books.The senior grade was more difficult. I had to skip meals and sacrifice sleep to get above-average marks with the occasional high marks. I read a few non-fiction books that year. However, I did not get much out of them because of my poor learning workflow. I managed to get an average score of 11 out of all my subjects, with 12 being the highest you can get from each subject. I made it that far because I relied on plagiarism, Anki, and my poor implementation of GTD. Of course, I was not happy about any of that.Once the school year was over, I realized that college was next, and I had enough because I retained nothing at the end of the school year, was terrible at learning, heard that college is way harder, and did not know and still do not know what career to pursue. I thought of committing suicide, but I had the idea of taking a year off before going to college to make things right.I convinced my parents of the idea. I told them everything that happened in those last two years. Also, I told them about my goals to learn how to learn, choose a career, and study for that career. I think I gave them the wrong picture because they did not like the idea. However, they allowed me to because they said that it was my life and they would accept whatever I chose to do with it if I was sure of what I was doing. My father mentioned after the talk that he would like me to spend more time with them, but I have failed to fulfill that.Either way, taking a year off was a great choice. I discovered that I had many health problems that I was not aware of, such as my sleep and spine, and I am working towards fixing them. I also found out about the Zettelkasten Method, which was what I needed to learn efficiently. The method came with the nice bonus of making learning fun.However, things have not gone well.Setting up a laptop took me a long while. I borrowed my sister's laptop to work in a calm environment, but I ran into many problems with it, and I still have a few issues to fix.Dealing with my health problems is taking me longer than I thought. Not being affiliated with a medical center has forced me to solve the problems by myself. Couple that with my poor research skills and scarce money, and you got yourself a recipe for slow progress.My environment got noisy, and now I cannot work with the Zettelkasten Method. Progress on fixing this has been slow because of the scarcity of money and prioritizing my sleep issue.I overcomplicated myself and tried to tackle more than I can handle. I maintained many active projects and created projects out of ideas that seemed actionable but that were not. I have wasted a lot of time here.And lastly, I went back to gaming. I believed that I needed leisure time after two years of all work and no play, so I began to play video games for 30 mins a day before my wind-down routine. Gaming washed away the suicidal thoughts I have been having. However, I realize that I am doing it for escapism.Ten months or so have passed since I began this year off, and I am left with five before I am supposed to go to college. I am anxious about going to college because I want to reach my goals and solve my health issues. But, it will probably take me longer than I have available to do so. Besides, my parents do not know about my journey, and I fear what they might say if they knew.I am out of ideas at this point.

How do I get out of the hole I have dug myself in?",Depression
12723,"I am in another country right now (at my grandmas), and everyone is so mean. two out of the three cousins that are currently here are so mean; they ignore me and call me names for no reason, but then they feel bad every year when i leave. my grandma (like me) is depressed, and i feel too bad to tell her about this, because she is had bad reactions in the past. i miss my mom, but there are things i have to hide from her, too. we found out that were getting an apartment and, subsequently, being let off the street i do not want to soil her mood with the disorder that fucking ruined my life. last night, i got super emotional and i cried (with breaks) for 2-3 hours. cousin walked in on me, and he was practically begging for an answer, but i could not say anything. i feel like he cares, but hes only nice to me when i go back to the US. I am crying again right now, and my other cousin is in the room. he does not even fucking care. hes on his phone. I have never felt so useless. i love planning things, and i had so much to look forward to. i do not have any real interests, other than writing. i was excited to get a book out a book with a super realistic character. I have lost all motivation, and now, i really want to rent an apartment as an adult and live out my life there with no company. i do not want four kids and the other luxuries i once prayed for. i cannot stop crying",Depression
12724,"I used to be such an awful, selfish, horrible person. I hurt some people very, very badly when I was younger. I am basically the definition of when the victim of abuse becomes an abuser. I was fucking awful. I feel so bad for one person in particular, I did not respect their boundaries, they suffer from what I did. I did not know I did anything wrong, I never had any idea that what I was doing to anyone was wrong. I wish someone told me how awful the way I acted was. I have put so much work into completely relearning everything and viewing every single thing in such a healthier way, but this guilt from my past that I must carry with me hurts more than words could ever describe. Just knowing that they will always see me as who I was then is terrifying.Other than the guilt of what I did to people, the way they treated me too has also left me with extreme trauma and I feel so manipulative when I say that. When I was younger everyone around me treated others like shit, so it was normal to me, hence why I did not know I did anything wrong. I feel so manipulative when I say it, like I am trying to find a way to excuse my shitty actions but I know I am not. it is what I saw happening all around me everyday and the way I physically cannot leave my house without having atleast two panic attacks because of what they did to me. I was selfish, exetremely mentally ill, lacked any sort of healthy communicative skills, disrespected peoples boundaries, hurt someone in a way that nobody should ever have to be hurt. Every single thing that I remember from that time just makes me feel worse and worse. I know I am a good person, I have changed for myself and my future, I do not need to prove that to anyone. I actively try to treat people well, give people the benefit of the doubt, etc. I care about others like I did before I became such a toxic human. it is just these nights that the guilt resurfaces and it majorly tests my will to live.I need help but I feel since I was such a disgusting person, that I do not deserve to live. I feel like I do not deserve to get better if those people still suffer from my actions. it is so hard to just accept that I will have to live and heal with the consequences for the rest of my life, they weigh me down so much. I have tried apologizing, some went well but the one I feel the most awful about will never be the same. I have tried every way that I can find to just find peace, and usually I am able to just get through each day, but fuck it is so bad right now.I do not know what to do, therapy has not helped cope with this guilt because I cannot even admit all of my actions because of how shitty they were. I feel like the complete scum of the earth who should not deserve to breathe even though I have learned from my mistakes and believe so much in rehabilitative justice. I just cannot feel this pain so intensely for so long, it is a debilitating physical pain combined with my self hatred from abuse I endured growing up. I try to look for the positives, I always do but no matter what I keep having this inner war that just circles right back to the ""if they still suffer, I must suffer.""I want this to end. I need this to end. I want end this constant suffering from the guilt I carry every day.",Suicidal
12729,"Throwaway for reasons that will become apparent.For some basic info about me, I (19M) have been diagnosed with MDD a little over 2 years ago after a suicide attempt. I am currently on lexapro and attending regular biweekly therapy sessions. Currently scheduled screening for ADHD as well.Recently I have not been feeling much of anything. I was not sure if it was the meds; I hear SSRIs and SNRIs have a high chance of causing numbness. But I am having doubts about that.Prior to about 6 months ago, I would regularly and deliberately inflict harm on the dog we have at our home (was my grandma's dog, bequeathed to my mom after my grandma passed). Methods of abuse include forcefully dragging, punching, dropping heavy objects on it, and throwing it. The dog has since been rehomed, and both my mom and therapist are aware of the problem. I did not feel any remorse for harming the dog, but felt some anxiety of being caught. I have not been diagnosed with ASD, any cluster B personality disorder, or conduct disorder.I do not tend to feel empathetic towards people. In fact, emotional people tend to annoy me. I have contemplated ASPD and CD being two possibilities for diagnoses but my therapist disagrees with both. This emotional numbness and difficulty empathizing interferes with my depression occasionally. It makes me think that I will live life forever as a robot, and that I could possibly be physically incapable of connecting with other people, and simply live through life as an unemotional, ostracized she will of a person. I would like to feel something, and I would like to connect with other people. My therapist sees this as a good sign; and stated that most sociopaths or psychopaths do not care about this.I am paranoid that the reason for my emotional numbness is more ""ingrained"" and innate, rather than being an issue caused by environmental factors. Rambling about what is on my mind",Depression
12731,"It was really weird dream, like most of them are tbh, but I have never killed myself in a dream before last night. Pretty much all of my dreams are kind of staged like I am sat in front of a screen watching this TV show of the dream that switches between me watching myself on screen from a 3rd person perspective and then me in the fake show in my body like usual. Halfway through though, it basically turned into a VR first person shooter game where I was just a floating pair of gloves holding guns and I had to choose whether to spare this random guy or kill him in order to finish the game. Then I suddenly realised I was dreaming, and of course, I am just like everybody here and I think about suicide all the time, have not been happy with life since I was 11 or 12 and am in a nearly constant state of misery. So I took that chance to try and kill myself, started with shooting in the side of the head but it did not work. I just ""took damage"" because of the stupid I am in a video game thing going in the dream. So I took out a shotgun, held it under my chin, shot myself and I died.There was this brief moment that lasted no more than a second where I had zero thought going on in my head, it was all black and I has absolutely no clue what was happening. Maybe I felt what it was like for a bit but I doubt it. I woke up, but it was not one of those things where you jolt awake just before hitting the ground, I woke up like normal as if this dream was not extremely fucked up.Killing myself, did not feel like a relief like I thought it would. It just felt wrong, in some sick way, it felt too easy. I have known for a while now that I will probably never kill myself, purely because its too much work and I cannot even leave the house or brush my teeth let alone find some method of suicide. Now I know for sure that I will not kill myself. From that moment forward, I will just sit in hole suffering with no escape, and just let the world pass me by. I have no easy exit anymore, so I will have to just deal my shit some other way. Not exactly a better option, but I prefer it I think.If you are reading this and you still want to kill yourself, suicide is not all you imagine it to be. Just take a moment to think ""what if I am wrong?"". I had a dream last night that I killed myself.",Depression
12734,"VENT TW: suicidal thoughts, wanting to die, abuse(?) mentionHi readers.... this is one of the only safe places I have to express myself. And its my last resort. I am on the verge of doing something stupid and my thoughts are scattered, so please bear with me.I hate myself, really, really hate myself. I was born into a family of narcs, two bio parents that never actually wanted to raise their kids. Dad was not as bad, i guess. He mostly never called or texted while we were growing up. He stopped, anyway. And T (that is my egg donor who does not deserve to be called a mom) was an incredibly abusive bitch. I can tell she has never actually loved her kids, me especially. So I got a lot more of the abuse when I was a child, and as an adult, I sometimes fall into the same type of relationships I used to have. I try so so hard not to, but its like these people find me and I cannot get away.So that brings me to my current bf. I thought he was the most beautiful person when we met. He knew about my issues, I was upfront. But I did tell him I do my best to keep my emotions from becoming too much. And I have worked in therapy for 3+ years to be better, and I felt like I was making progress. But now I am wondering if maybe I am just a narc and I give myself too much credit for my progress. He literally told me after we met that he was a bad person and a monster. (When people tell you who they are, listen, right?) And I honestly was wary but just figured he had issues like anyone else. Except the more time we have spent together (been together for two years in Dec) he really just seems to hate me.We do not usually argue, but when we do he basically threatens to leave me all the time. And I literally have to basically get on my hands and knees shaking from the panic attacks like a dog, unable to talk from crying so much or else he does not believe that I love him and want him to stay. His favorite thing to tell people about me is that I am obedient and that I do what he says. Obedient! Like i *am* a dog. Like its my only good quality, and for the record, I have a mind of my own. I do not always do things he says, but if he asks me to hand him something, I do it and its not a problem. But if I do not, then he tells me stuff like I do not love him and he is second guessing our relationship because I will not do what he asks. And if he walks put the door to leave, if I do not chase after him, I do not love him enough or at all.he will get hurt by any little thing I say or make assumptions about things I say or do, but then he will turn around and project it back on me and say that I do not listen to him, I over react, etc. He never takes responsibility for any of the mean and hurtful shit he says. Its always my fault for not understanding or ""attacking"" him. (I could literally just ask him to pick up after himself and he will literally flip his shit).I am not going to say I am perfect, or that I never have said anything mean to him. However, I always apologize and work on whatever he claims has hurt him so that I do not do it again. He refuses to do the same, claiming that he will never change because that is how he is. he is even basically said suicidal people deserve to die (knowing that I have issues with this). This is already so long, so I am going to stop, but my heart is broken and I cannot stop crying. I wish I was dead and if I ever mustered up the strength to do it, he would be the reason why. I love him, and I do not understand why he is so fucking mean.If you read all this, thanks. And I am sorry. My bf has made me hate myself after years of therapy, and I wish I was dead. Why cannot I find someone who genuinely loves me like I love them?",Depression

I am so happy and our relationship is pretty solid, but I have discovered that I have a lot more stuff to work on than I thought.What I notice lately is that I am always thinking about her, or the fact that I want to spend time with here, but I am very harsh on myself about that, I say to myself that I should not be so mellow.

12736,"Hello guys, I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this (and sorry for my english in advance) but i wanted to tell you how unusual I have felt since 2 days ago. Basically since I woke up on Tuesday I have been feeling numb, like there is a fog in my brain and i lost interest for activities I normally do and really enjoy, like watching movies.The weirdest thing about it is that I have irrational thoughts about it, like literally 3 days ago i was watching old obscure essay films and literally the next day I found myself thinking ""what is the point of movies? they are fake, those are actors"" and I cannot wrap my head around this.Added to the fact that I have constantly felt tired and sleepy I naturally thought about depression or anxiety, but i have never had any of those things before, in fact I am usually the cheer-up guy in the family and usually find the silver lining even out of the most dark situations that have happened, so it is being very sudden and unexplainable (nothing has happened in my personal life lately either to justify this).I also thought it might be a side effect of Nasonex, that is a corticosteroid nasal spray I have taken since the 8th of July and I have read it has some side effects, but in the instructions it does not say anything about psychological effects so i kind of wrote it off. Then looking online I have read corticosteroids can actually produce anxiety or depression sometimes but it is very rare.

12743,"I am thirty years old, female.I was born on another continent and now I live in the Bay Area. Due to my parental units job, my nuclear family had to relocate countries and continents approximately every 2-3 years.While it may seem fun to explore and live in new places, it completely tore apart any construct of social cohesion, community and it obliterated the childhood and adolescent friendships I had formed. It certainly does not help that I am an introvert at heart.Just when I thought I was getting comfortable in one location or with one group of friends, it was whisked away from me once again. I had to go through life milestones alone because I often did not have friends right after moving to a new place.As a result, I became bitter, aloof, skeptical, distant and frankly a bit lost in life because I did not feel like I belonged in my home country or the new communities I frequently moved to.

I do not want children either, but if I do not have them then people will judge me. I believe in God... I think? I do not know anymore. Everything seems to be a distraction from the truth of reality. Once we erase money, entertainment, buildings, all human-made creations, then we will have nothing. But did we ever have anything? It was always nothing but comfort for our minds.I am sick of ableism, racism, sexism, etc. Why cannot we just forget what happened in the past and think about the future of humankind? we are always behaving like God, judging others as if our opinions matter. Judging each other's appearances, intelligence, and social behaviours. But what is the point of it? People judge others so they feel better about themselves.Life is pointless to me. We graduate from school to find a job, use their deserved money to purchase gifts for themselves, but the items will never be truly theirs. One day, everyone who is reading this post will die. Then someone will take their items, whether they are from their family or another. Some will sell their treasures while others will keep them for themselves. But none will love the items as much as you do. Your items will soon be recycled or forgotten. Dreams are much better.

12751,I am use to sad and depressed but literal indifference literal muting of any strong emotion. I feel like this pill has made it easier to want to end it.Not that I am going to act on it because that would be the end which while tempting I have to remind myself that I can try a different medication.I thought about therapy but what would that accomplish? Accept that you had a shi**y childhood done now can we move on I have already dealt with the abuse I suffered. My depression does not have trigger's it is always here in the background.The abuse is not the problem the problem is the chemicals in my head. Tried pot and I felt like I went for a ride to the sunken place. Tried alcohol and no buzz just tiredness. I do not even want to know what anything more serious would do.I just want to have moments of happiness I just want the cloud to go away. I am falling into old bad habits such as trying to establish unhealthy relationships because atleast if I make someone else happy I might feel like I am of use. Logically I know I am of use and have argued with my emotions to no ends. Logically I know I am setting myself up for pain when I realize that the connection with others is less than shallow. I feel so indifferent emotionally speaking that I had to stop myself from trying to engage in sex not because I would enjoy it 1. because I have not in the past and 2. because the thing will not get hard. but because in those few minutes when the woman is feeling good I might be able to steal a little satisfaction in my work.I do not expect sympathy I am not cutting or planning not that I would need to I am pretty sure I could do it with the pills I have now. Not that I will because depression is not done with me yet and I am not ready to give up on escaping through medication and eventual life improvement. Thanks for letting me vent these thoughts at a time when I do not feel like I have anyone who I can say this too. Well time to get up and embrace the indifference because honestly it is pretty useful at getting me through work and helping me keep these new bursts of agitation from getting out.

12758,"For several months now, I have wanted to not be alive anymore. I have come up with plans that I have come scarily close to following through on. I have gotten addicted to self harm again. I have not been okay for a long time now and I just want all the bad stuff to stop.The biggest reason for all of this comes down to two things. The first is my own life. I have no motivation in life anymore. I am stressed out. I have NO money, I am terrified of getting a full time job, and my dad is being really picky about me getting a part-time job to get by because he is paranoid about me losing my medical insurance for being low-income. it is a lot of very sudden change and I am not ready for it. Like, at all. The thought of having to start a new life, start a career, move out, and fend for myself financially is simply too much for me to handle and I have felt like my life had basically ended since I graduated from university.The second reason is my relationship. She makes me happy. She ACTUALLY makes me happy. she is so damn good to me. After being molested at 14, cheated on, catfished, emotionally abused, manipulated, sexually pressured beyond my comfort zones to the point of trauma, and tons more horrible treatment, I finally found a person who is kind to me, who cares about me, and who legitimately treats me right. She is happy with me. She tells me every single day how lucky she feels to be with me but I feel it is the other way around. We do not argue. We do not fight. We have differences and disagreements but we talk them out and never get upset with each other. Ever. It is everything I have ever wanted in a relationship and so much more. Is it perfect? No. Nobody is. But we never have problems with each other because we are okay with our differences and have so much else in common that it does not matter.The problem? Her life outside of being with me is kind of a mess. She escaped from an extremely abusive situation only to find herself in another more dangerous one. She has more freedom now, but she also has to fend for herself, which nobody ever taught her how to do. she is sheltered. she is inexperienced. She feels guilty for everything wrong around her because people have bashed into her head that everything is somehow her fault. And now her roommates are all treating her like shit, financially using her even knowing damn well how much she is struggling, and one of them is an actual dangerous psychopath who is mentally unstable and basically a sexual predator. Nobody in her household gives a flying fuck about her safety or mental wellbeing. And I feel like it is all my fault for getting her out of her old abusive home and into this one. She wants to leave. She wants to move out and find new roommates and get a better life for herself, but she was never taught how to do any of this and does not have any responsible adults in her life whatsoever. Nobody is there IRL to help her. We spend 24/7 together outside of her working, and when we do that, we are happy. But there is just so much bad shit going on in her life that she needs to get away from, for both of our sakes mentally, and it is so damn difficult because there is only so much a sheltered runaway can do. Given the circumstances she is doing amazing as it is and I am more proud of her than I could ever put into words, but it is stressful as fuck and hard on both of us regardless. Even though we are happy with each other, I am terrified. I do not know if we are going to make it out the other side of this. Neither of us wants to give up on the other, but the world seems to love to make it feel impossible for us to survive in an adult world.I do not want to go on if life is going to be this harsh to me. It just is not worth fighting for. Even if the payoff is something good, even if there somehow is happiness waiting for me on the other side, I do not want it if this is what I have to endure to get there. I have wanted to die ever since this living situation started, both my own and that of the one goddamn person I ever loved who has been genuinely good to me despite everything being against us. I am just tired. I am out of energy. I know damn well that I do not have it in me to kill myself. I might come close but knowing me I doubt I would be brave enough to ever go through with it. Honestly, I have lived out the past several months hoping to die in some kind of accident, and I do not know how to get any semblance of hope back. I know I need it, but it is just not there and I do not have the energy to search for it anymore.I do not know how to cope with these thoughs. She knows about them and encourages me to talk to her about it, and when I do she IS helpful, but I feel horribly manipulative and I feel emotionally abusive for saying something about suicidal thoughts or self harm. I just feel horrible for bringing it up. I do not know how to talk to her about it without feeling like a terrible person. And let me make this very clear: SHE does NOT make me feel this way. She does not guilt trip me. She does not feel manipulated or controlled. In fact, she goes out of her way to specify otherwise. But I personally cannot shake the feeling that I am being manipulative. it is not her making me feel like that. I just feel that way on my own, for saying anything at all. How do I tell people I love I am suicidal without feeling manipulative?",Suicidal

I remember running away from people all around me laughing at me as I just tried to get away from them so I could find a space to crawl into and curl up. Once I woke up, this sense of worthlessness still stuck around but I could not find any of the thought processes that I know how to combat now. I just felt like an awful human for no reason.And then I imagined what it would be like if I was in a country with easy access to handguns and if I had one myself. It suddenly felt very easy to imagine myself loading it and holding it to my skull. The decision to pull the trigger feels like it would be so easy, and yet I do not understand why. I am in a better place than I was last year. I feel fairly free and OK with life where as back then I was planning out the finer details of how to take my own life, and yet that idea of dying still feels like the only way I am going to get away from these thoughts completely.Is that my reality now? Having to occasional fight the urge to end it all for no particular reason? Why does the decision to end it feel so easy?",Depression

He started choking the life out of her and I had to restrain him while watching the blood drop from my mothers face. That image and this memory will forever be with me, breaking me apart even more.

It feels awful that I am stuck in this cycle, but I feel like I need to get out of it because no one wants to be around a Debby downer, I understand. I have been there with others.I want out. I want to get out of this cycle but my standards for myself are high, because I do not want to be someone who I would not have wanted to be around (if that makes sense).I am genuinely just jaded, tired, exhausted. I know if I cannot be my best self then there is no point in presenting myself to new people. I have been lonely lately due to this mindset.If anyone has been in a similar place PLEASE let me know if you have found a way to cope. Can someone relate at all (22f)?",Depression
12795,"2:56 AMnot sure i belong here without a proper diagnosis, but it has occurred to me over the previous months of self reflection that the way my brain functions may be similar to those who proactively post in this community. I have worked the past 2 years under the shine of moonlight (12 hour shifts) and have contributed the sickness plaguing my mind to the lack of sunlight, activities. After further consideration and insight into this illness i cannot help but notice several similarities in my behavior that are commonly linked to depression. a small part of me wants to better myself, but another has the need for isolation, to pull itself away to become unknown. if life itself truly is a simulation i want out.Journal: the thoughts of disapproval, hate and unwant in those in our social bubble lead us to the only feasible answer. Isolation. But isolation only leads us to loneliness, a feeling too unbearable for myself to cope with. Isolation is the key and the cell. The plague drives us from who we think we know to trap us in a prison where within it lies in wait, it is only purpose to leech and degrade the only thing keeping it alive. 3:20 AM I am New",Depression

12812,"I was recently diagnosed with GAD and Major Depressive Disorder, and it feels weird. I know my intention was to get diagnosed, but now I feel like an imposter. ""Am I really depressed?"" ""What if I exaggerated and I am really fine?"" All of these what ifs are taking a toll on me.I know I am anxious. I always have been and I do not see that changing. I guess it feels weird because I had not considered depression before going in for a diagnosis. I guess I always pictured that depressed people experience constant sadness (I know that some do). I guess for me it just kind of feels like nothing. I am not happy or sad. I am just existing. I would not commit suicide, but life is not colorful or exhilarating. To be honest, it feels monotonous and tiring. I still have instances of brief happiness and I can distract myself with work, but when it is just me, it hits. I hate reality so I do everything I can to avoid it. I am so tired every day. I am irritable, unfocused, I have no motivation, and my memory sucks (according to my psychologist).

12827,"Within the past six/seven months I recently got out of a marriage with a person who was a narcissist as well as verbally and mentally abusive. I was with him for four years. In the process of going through our divorce, there was a guy that I messaged on pretty much a daily basis. Honestly more so for advice and such. Well eventually things happened and one thing led to another and we got super close. We started dating and honestly I could not be happier. He honestly has been the best thing that has ever happened to me. He treats me how I deserve and should be treated. Compliments just about every day and does everything he can to show how much I mean to him. Of course I do in return. However, in the past I have been through several relationships that have either been abusive or just was toxic in general. Plus I had a very rough childhood regarding my father. Over time this has caused me to be more so or somewhat second guessing when I have got in a relationship with someone. On whether their feelings are actually mutual, whether or not they could potentially cheat, if I actually meant something to them etcWell the guy I met while my ex-husband and I were going through a divorce like I mentioned, in the 5 months or so since him and I have been together the way I have been treated by him is something I am not used to. I have never been treated with this much respect by someone. Part of me constantly second guesses on whether or not its real or if I am just living a fairytale and one day I am just going to wake up and its all going to be a dream. With my past history of relationships of them being toxic I never got the love and appreciation I deserved. Even when I gave the relationship 110% I was not even receiving half that. With that being said I need some advice or coping mechanisms that I can help ease this constant thought in my mind of always second guessing on whether or not its real or fake. I do not want to end up pushing him away because honestly hes the best thing that is came into my life. Please no judging or rude comments. Struggling",Depression
12829,"Trigger warning: suicide, forced hospitalization It feels selfish to be sad all the time. I have an internship doing stuff I legit dreamed about as a child, making more money in a season than some people do all year, living in California, with a social life and a roof over my head. I have a full ride for a masters degree and am a published scientific author and have done thing that five years ago I could have only dreamed of doing. But I am not happy.In January my best friend of 10 years, who I had recently, killed themselves. They were the first person I talked to every day and tbh some days they were also the only person I talked to. They were beautiful and kind and the nicest person I have ever met and I would have given them the world without hesitation. I loved them (in every sense) more than I have ever loved anyone else including myself. We actually ran away together but then had to come back because of our silly little obligations. Even before they passed I had days were the only reason I got out of bed and went to class was because I knew it would distract me from the things that were keeping me in bed. I would frequently lay on the floor for hours at the end of the day, so much so that I eventually just go a sleeping bag which I keep rolled out in a corner of my room. My poor mental health only spiraled after their death. Suddenly, the person I told everything to was gone. The person who forced me to apply to half of those things was gone. And so when acceptance letters were rolling in I was not happy because I could not celebrate with the one person I wanted to celebrate with. I am not saying they were my only friend, I have 3 other people that I al extremely close to, but my friend who passed was always the very first person I told.Then in late April things got really bad and I ended up getting forcibly hospitalized for a week. Suddenly all of the freedom that I spent my entire life working for was gone and I had to work my ass of to be cleared for release.Now I just feel weird all the time. Like I have done all these things but I am not happy. I feel more alone than I have ever felt before and I am scared I am going to spiral again. My therapist is also quitting so I have to find a knew one and that is stressful and I feel like I have no one left I can be sad with because realistically I think the only thing I experience anymore beside sadness is apathy.

I denied it. She then asked to smell my breath and she knew instantly. She had alcoholic parents growing up so she is good at knowing when somebody is drunk. She also went through my bag and found snus, which is a kind of tobacco product.So i started crying and told her i needed help and that i was depressed. She said that she could help with that and get me a therapist. I was actually kind of relived that she caught me so i could finally get help.

12844,"I have never been good with Reddit, or even sharing stuff about my life but I will try to post something that is not a mess.I am not sure where to start because I have never been able to track the source of all my misery.I am a male on his early 20s. Raised by a single mother, never had any paternal figure that would teach me how to become a man.I am what you would call a peak introvert. I HATE talking to people, interacting with strangers, I am AWFUL with women even if I am not attracted to one, I still feel extremely awkward and make a fool of myself. I can make ""friends"" and conversate with people if I had to, but most of the time when anyone talks to me I can barely wait for them to shut up and stop talking to me, no matter who they are, I just get lost on my thoughts.I never had a girlfriend, but did met someone online not long ago with whom i established some sort of virtual ldr. We talked for years until she got tired of waiting. That brought me down even further. The glimpse of hope I had for a normal life, was lost. I get easily lost on my train of thought so i do not even know where I am going with this lol.But anyways, the point i try to convey is that I am weak. I am extremely weak and have always been. Every time i was faced with adversity, I would give up.I joined football teams with my friends, and when they stopped going or I started making a fool of myself during the games, I would stop going. I would give up at the first shortcoming.I dropped out of college on the second week because I had to make a presentation and i was scared to talk in front of the whole class. Who on earth does that???I have no passions, no hobbies other than sleep, waste money and time on the gym (seeing crappy results in strength and size), play videogames (just to kill time, even that does not please me anymore), destroy my brain even further watching porn and wallow in my own misery. So my freaking life is a mess right now. If I really cared, I know I could do something about it...but do I care? No sir. I do not care what befalls me, what befalls my family or what befalls the world.Ever seen that Spiderman web of shadows meme? that is exactly how I feel. My world falling apart but I am just walking right through the middle like nothing is happening because I do not care. I turned my back on God...I am no man, I am garbage, I am a worm, I am nothing.Am i seeking for help? Am i seeking to get out of this place i find myself in? Will i listen to advices? What can you do when you do not care? When you feel like life is always against you. That when you feel like trying, you try and then boom! you are immediately denied of any form of improvement, no matter what you try because you are freaking weak!Sorry for the messy post, English is not my first language and i lose focus very easily.Thanks.

I had early access to the internet so I was not unaware of real life, I have just felt like an adult from maybe age 8 since my parents always involved me in all adult dramas and problems. My mom is chronically ill and bipolar (except not manic-depressive, more like calm-rage). My dad is an emotionally dead husk. My parents have never let me go out on my own except for my internship this summer, like literally i never saw someone my own age until I was 14. They will not let me work, will not let me do anything for myself (will not even let me make my own lunch). it is fucking insane. I have tried killing myself a couple times but it did not work. But I was a little bitch and did not make a real effort, i tried to strangle myself but it did not work. I usually just try to bury myself in reading or watching something, and lately I have been reading a lot of science fiction which just makes me feel horrible. My life is so boring and I get zero independence, I am a nerd who likes things nobody else i know likes (case in point: SCP Foundation). SciFi is horrible because I will be just enjoying an SCP video and it will end and lo and behold, a fat (not morbidly but somewhat) loser sitting in his room staring into a screen, with three windows: YouTube, Google docs for my internship, and CS:GO which I will play for 15 minutes, rage to the point at which I have literally either cried or punched a wall because I suck at that too like everything else, quit CSGO for an hour, watch an SCP video, do sub-par work, play csgo, restart the Ouroboring cycle. Life is just so boring. I am going to be honest, i enjoyed watching the Ww3 scare last year, watching the capitol siege. Even when it is horrible things nobody wants it feels good just to see something interesting happen for me.

I am now at the point where I have set the date and plan and everything's ready for me to go. I just want to know why it had to be this way. I have been used as an emotional crutch by so many only to be forgotten about when they are out of their darkest times. I have never been anyone's first choice. Even my wife cheated on me after I worked so hard for our life together. Then at the end of my military career thinking I can finally be free to love and support her to the fullest I get hit with the biggest fuck you I ever experienced. I broke down and when I needed support I was told ""I am too busy, maybe later?"" I went on my days mindless and numb. I am so afraid of killing myself that the sole reason why I deployed was to die on the battlefield. I was unlucky and the ambush did not kill me. I think about how my suffering could have easily have ended if I had just peaked up and let them put the bullet in my head. Why have I made it this far? I have talked to my therapist, I have talked to people who ""relate"", but I can tell they do not have the slightest clue. I really wish I could have been dealt better cards in life but I have enough self awareness to understand that is just how life is. I only wanted to be happy and content with a normal life. A small circle of friends or people that I could actually depend on. Instead I am just alone and there is really no signs of turning it around. I have tried my hardest to reach out to others but it is always me who has to go the extra mile to maintain any sort of relationship. I cannot ever get someone to meet me half way. Pretty long rant and I am sure no one will truly ever care. I am just another person. Just a number to the statistic. People around me may grief for a bit because they had the slightest connection to me but will forget about it later because they have their own life to live. And I understand that. Any how this was pretty long, I am doing whatever I want and have been pretty reckless as the date is pretty close. I am hoping I can find the peace in death that I have desired so much but have been so terrified of at the same time. I wish the best for everyone and I hope you all find peace with yourself before it gets to a stage where you feel like there is no going back. Just another person.",Suicidal

The whole job interview process is painful and the stuttering is just as bad. I have a lot of experience, but cannot blame them for not hiring me when I completely lack confidence and cannot put together a normal sounding sentence. I try to practice, but it does not work. The more job rejection I face, the worse everything gets. After being constantly rejected by jobs and guys I have dated, I have zero confidence left. I cannot even look in the mirror. I hate myself SO much. When I see my reflection I feel sick and disgusted with the person looking back. It sounds bizarre, but I have this really strange feeling of wanting to scrub my face off; I am so overcome with disgust I just want to physically scrub the disgust away. Last week I ended up looking like I had a severe sunburn after - it is such a strange urge that I had never experienced before.

Maybe he was right.My older brother had a friend named Ed when I was little. Ed lost his left arm in a motorcycle accident in his early 20s. He dealt with heroin addiction most of his life, until he finally got himself cleaned up.

I do not have a family or very many friends and I just want some fucking care and I want to be held. When I was in the ICU last time I had nurses constantly check on me and ppl come talk to me. A part of me lives in a hospital, because that is all I have really known. Do I want to kill myself? Or do I miss being cared about? If I attempt suicide and it fails, than I go to the ICU or hospital. If I attempt suicide and succeed, than I get the added bonus if dying I suppose.

I either call my parents and have them come pick me up, or I go to the hospital in an ambulance. I chose the former, and my Dad came in. He spoke to me in ways I could not understand. He told me that he gave me words of encouragement, but I cannot remember any of them. My psych told him I must be dissociating through all of the positive stuff (in context, I have a dissociative disorder), so I forgot about things five seconds after he told them to me. it is like my body naturally does not process any positive thing any one says or does, and any that do my body seems to interpret as a sexual stimulant, and my body reacts accordingly.He told me he worried that something bad was going to happen to me all the time since I was a baby,, and continued to feel that way into my adulthood, even to this day. Then he tells me that he made me a sheltered kid, and that doing so hurt me more than anything he is ever done, and I do not know the world and how it works, and probably why I am who I am today.

Because of that, the relationship ship ended and I have been grieving since then. I (28m) know this makes it difficult to connect with new relationships over the past three years since. Tho, I have never really gone crazy over someone till now. We have been talking on and off for longer than six months and I think I am past the infatuation stage. The connection I feel is deeper than physical despite her being super hot. We do live a distance apart but I am willing and able to move. I do not know whether she likes me back and she is hiding it because of my baggage or some other reason, or whether I am just friend zoned which seems to be my common problem. she is just been incredibly supportive over the past six months in my journey as a friend, I had hoped these feelings would go away but they have not and it is getting to the point where I need to either cut off the friendship which will be challenging for me because I have few supports in my life. Or I have to find a way to deal with these feelings that are intertwined now with my suicidal thoughts and depression which makes it hard to deal with.How do I deal with the feelings since they do not seem to fit in my box that I bottle everything up in and deal with later, without making my current feelings of unworthiness and lack of hope worse? do not know what to do with these feelings",Depression

I do not know how to describe it, but my depression really overrides my body and mind and I, like a robot just follow it. My bedroom had gotten really messy so a few days ago I built up the courage to finally try to clean it. I knew I did not want to do it and the fact I even did made me feel odd. As if I was shocked I got out of bed. So I am cleaning and doing pretty good and all of a sudden my brain was like nope I really cannot do this anymore and I just shut off my bedroom lights and went to bed and I had never just said fuck it like that before. Since may I have been getting really in to spirituality and focusing on myself and connecting with the world. Yes it made me feel amazing. I really feel I transformed. Except as of lately I am going back to old habits I finally stopped during that time. I become a bitch to everyone, I have attitude for no reason. No but the worst part is the worthlessness I feel. From age 11-22 I do not think I have ever not had suicidal thoughts. Well in May-July I really was so high on spirituality and accepting the world around me. I honestly did not have bad thoughts come in to my head. But as of this week I am back to the same shit. I cannot get the imagine of cutting out of my head. Or other methods (I have always imaged a rope or g*n but know I would not use one method and I could never buy the other). And at this point it does not feel depressing it feels annoying. Like my depression is taunting me like hey do not you still want to do this. And the answer is yes. I have derealization issues, I have self worth issues. I have a hard time accepting I am alive and its just a lot to deal with. Before May when I had these thoughts I believed them. I still believe them but this time I know its more a mental illness and not my souls desire if that makes sense. Like a heart attack is the hearts issue but the heart did not do it on purpose its just an inconvenience.

12928,"People talk about life having meaning as a wonderful thing, but I see it as an idiotic concept that is perpetuated by the most idiotic and unaware people. These people cannot get around the fact that life has no meaning, so they not only feel like they have to lie to themselves, but also lie to everyone else in order to make them believe their absurdity so they will verify their own views on human existence.The ideologies that center around human life having cosmic meaning are built on lies upon lies. Meaning is not brought upon a person the moment they are born, unlike what some people might want you to believe. The moment you are born, your life has just as much meaning as a rock or a pile of dirt, because everything in the universe is just piles of matter from the moment they come into existence to the moment they are destroyed.Consciousness is the only difference between living matter and inanimate matter. But being conscious does not change the fact that our existence is meaningless, it only means that we have the ability to comprehend our meaningless existence.All of our abilities, accomplishments, goals, and dreams do not change the fact that our lives are meaningless. It does not matter what we do with our lives to try and prove our worth as humans, none of that causes our existence to have meaning. We could invent lightspeed space travel, immortality, or even time travel and that still will not make us anything more than meaningless creatures that have accomplished extraordinary things.No matter how it makes us feel, humans, along with all other living creatures, are just things - things that just so happen to be conscious, but things none the less; and no matter how hard we try to not think about it, this is a fact of life that cannot be changed with lies and idealistic thinking.

Admittedly, I do not offer up this information freely aside from close friends and family not out of shame, more so hoping not to have triggering conversations in social/family situations. Anyway, growing up in an emotionally void and abusive household I have become such a people pleaser Ill often offer every ounce of my time, money, energy, resources etc. to those who need it which I have realized subconsciously I have been programmed to believe is the only way to receive love. These past two years have been so hard. Depression broke apart my engagement, lost me my dream job, and I have disconnected with essentially all of my friends because I am just too exhausted to reply or leave home outside of necessity. This week I began to take baby steps toward feeling better including opening up to my loved ones, starting therapy, and medication. Next was my financial situation which I have ignored (this was quite scary) but I knew I had to start facing things scared or not. My absolute closest friend had been trying to plan a trip across the country that I would love to love to attend but truthfully, was so daunting as the date neared closer. Finally today I faced this pile of bills and realized there was no way I could attend this extravagant trip and rationally spend $1500 or so for it (we had not booked flights yet which were $500 alone). I knew I had to have a really difficult conversation and finally today I did. As raw and honest as possible about the reasons Id not known this sooner and how I could not bare the thought of them being upset with me over it. I apologized profusely as this is a result of my own actions. They are upset, not necessarily at me directly but says they just want to make alternate plans with their bf.

I do not want to die an old frail man into this absurd circus that the world has become. Me and a few left still have the old spirit. But to die at war nowadays is not what it once was. We die for politicians that do not care for us. For the rich. If it was for me, I would put them all to the sword. I want to die. But first, I need to achieve glory. But what is glory nowadays? What do we worship? What do we do when confronted by this question? Sex? Worthless temporary pleasure. Drinking and taking drugs? Temporary, again. What unites are an action? What is the utmost answer to these pathetic clowns that they throw at us? This day and age, I cannot die for my country as I do not believe in it nowadays, even if I do believe in our spirit. I will have to end it all in some years, before I reach full ""maturity"". I will die. I will die, indeed. I crave for death so much. But still. There are things to do, still, in this world. In order to achieve enough to be able to die. Glorious death in this day and age.",Suicidal
12966,Obvious throwaway. I have just lived life just I do not know just living so that my little sister does not lose her older sibling. I had a family once. Two families united. It was not perfect but it was a family. My grandmother always hated me she would tell me that I was useless at the age of 8 and that i would grow up to be a fat and useless slob that would attain nothing in life. My father well he never really cared for me he would let his mother talk about me and say all of this to me. I am now known as the recluse of the family who is a failure. My father believes in many superstitious stuff. My parents were going to divorce when I was 13 it shattered my whole reality. I lost vision of what family even was. That was the day that i lost both sides of my family. My father brainwashed me by suggesting certain ideas to the point that i could envision them in my mind. He used me to get back with my mother. I ruined my mother and my sisters life for being weak. Years pass family still broken. Have been diagnosed with severe depression. Dad talks ill about my mother and accuses her of adultery with women. I try to defend her he believes nothing but the superstitious beliefs and advice that his family and peers offer. I have done nothing yet I have been beat physically and mentally. I am not even loving for myself. I do not know what to do anymore. I have always wanted to die since I was a child but I have held on long enough for my little sister. I cannot keep doing this. My mind is breaking. I feel myself slipping away. No one wanted me in this world not even my own family. My own father my own grandmother and the paternal side of the family. I was the oldest grandchild but i was always belittled so that the smaller boy could be seen as the prodigy. I was nothing. I am dirt. I am trash. I want to die I am so weak. My sister has tried to make me feel better for what I have attained in life. I did not attain it because I wanted to I only did it because it was expected of me. I do not know what I am doing with my life. I can envision no future. I am broken. No person will want me as their partner. I want to die. I need to die maybe that way i can free my family of the shackles of a useless parasite as my dad called me. I can tell my own mother dislikes me too deep down. Why would not she it is my fault my father is still in our life. He broke her too. She is beyond repair. I have doomed us all. Both sides of the family hate each other. Death threats have happened attempts at murder have happened. I do not think i deserve to live. Autism and severe depression are nothing but a joke in my father's and mother's eyes. I am meant to be normal like everyone else who is able to live life headstrong. I cannot take this anymore. I have never had anyone and i never will. So many thoughts so much i want to say nothing comes out. No one really cares. it is all a facade. Deep down we are all selfish. it is okay the weak like me are not meant to survive. I am weak. I am nothing. For anyone willing to read.,Depression
12967,"ok so absolutely tw for the usual stuff you see here jumping right into it I have just cut myself again cos i was thinking too much. i have super duper bad ptsd (diagnosed, not treated, was told there was nothing they could do) and i was being referred to the psych team but i just cancelled all their calls cos i had an episode and told them not to bother ringing me back so they have not (fair enough to them, my fault) but i literally despise myself for it. i know i cannot be helped but that was my chance and i blew it and now I am not going to get another one so what is the point? i think the blade i used was bad too, it was old and dirty and now the cuts burn like they are on fire but I am too tired to care. if they get infected, they get infected. whatever. i wish i was not crazy, I am 18 and it feels like my life is already over. if i had the energy to stand and go to my drawer i feel completely sure in saying i would kill myself right now. everything i say just goes to the void anyway. who knows if this post will still be here in five minutes. the only thing keeping me going is the knowledge that my mum is really ill with cancer and she needs me to give her the meds she takes tomorrow cos my dad is at work and he cannot do it anyway. who cares. its all getting a bit much",Suicidal

I was prescribed trazedone to be used as needed but it makes me very moody and weepy so I do not use it. I know going to bed earlier would be ideal but that does not often happen for me (plus I am 17 so even though its not good to do, what are the odds of me actually going to bed on time?). I want to talk to my mom about taking them at a different time, and taking them myself. (All meds are locked up currently). I was home alone for 2 weeks and skipped them for like 5 days cuz sometimes i get depressed so its hard to get the motivation to get up to take them. I kept them by my bed which fixed that but did not tell my mom because I do not want her to worry about me stashing them or anything. Idk sorry this is kind of all over the place..

12974,"Sometime these symptoms this year hit me. I thought I would never be subjected to depression because I have never had it in my life, but that is clearly quite the contrary. I truly feel sorry for those who deal with it their entire life, it is so debilitating and can limit what someone is true potential is if not handled just right.A primary care provider (I do not usually stick with one because I barely used to go or I move) prescribed me ADHD meds - generic Ritalin and Adderall; they just made me feel like even more so of a zombie that 1) hated life and 2) had had energy for part of the day. Thankfully I was finally referred to a doctor with a psychiatric background that they are double booking to see me on Monday. I am so thankful he is doing that for me. And I am also thankful my state has allowed me to stay on state insurance while the pandemic goes on. Its ironic I barely utilized my insurance up until it is about to be cancelled once the state declares the pandemic is over (I graduated and got a job during the pandemic that makes a bit over the amount you are allowed to make and be disqualified for free state insurance). I hope it goes well and I get some better guidance to put me back on track.I know life can suck a ton and even finding a doctor can be a huge hassle, but it is worth it in the end. Connect with a doctor about your depression. Find your true self that is trapped within. Baby steps are still better than no steps. Treat yourself like a loved one - you deserve to be happy.

12975,"After 6 1/2 months, I have realized something. My life is not worth living at all. Day after day it keeps getting worse. Some days I am like Oh I feel better than I did yesterday, and by the end of said day I would be depressed again. Never ending cycle. Earlier today, one of my friends too me to try to look at the positive side of things. As much as I appreciate her advice, I cannot do that at all. I have tried many times since last year and it failed. Every. Single. Time. This is my new life now. Depressed, lonely, and strict. I want to kill myself so badly but I am not going to because of the affects of it. But would that even matter? My friends would care for like a week then back to business as usual. Earlier this year I was also impersonated by one of my classmates friends behind my back. Do most people even respect me? I have not done anything to them and yet I get treated poorly sometimes. Earlier this year as well, two of my friends also basically ditch me and some other friends. they have started to distance themselves from us and we still do not know why they did that. After. 5. Months. Now. I want all of us to be together again. If we were, I would at least be slightly happier about my life. I remember everyone was saying that 2021 was going to be better than 2020. In my case at least, it definitely has not. Not to mention school in general. 7th Grade is the reason why right now today, I am feel depressed and ready to call it quits. If I was not such a total idiot back in 2020, things could of possibly turned out differently in my life. Being a stupid introvert, its hard to express myself without either being flustered or nervous. Answering a simple question in school? I turn red. When I DM someone a message, I always turn off my device or look away because I am worried what they will say. Even with the simplest things on the planet. Why do I deserve this? Why does everyone else who has depression deserve this treatment? Why were we created to sometimes act like this? Suffering for almost a year is the new dark era of my life. And I am not where near done with it. At. All. I hate 2021 so much.",Suicidal

Unless you have time Id probably just leave this post. it will probably be long and Ill probably immediately delete it anyways. Alone is a really weird feeling because how can you be alone while technically surrounded? Well as someone who has a family who has a couple friends I have no one that I can express myself with. I have no one and nothing. I was going years of not telling anyone anything of the about my mental health and just trying and trying to believe what my dad said everything is mental. Even if that is true it does not mean you can control it. They way I think and how I rationalize things has lead me to be so alone. I am sure there is so much more but I feel like it comes from that. From me being too scared to tell anyone anything in fear of them leaving me more alone that I already am. I feel as I am a she will of myself because I am expected to be this person I have spent years and years faking in order to be accepted and liked and wanted and its not me its a form of everything I think I needed to be and I feel as if I am trapped in my own body. Any time I ever express real feelings I end up hurting someone or someone elses feelings. Right now everything in my body is screaming to stop typing and delete this but if I do that then what. I am already here. I apologize for anything and everything I do even before I do it just out of fear of not being liked and wanted and being alone but then I pause and start to think I have never been liked or wanted its only even beeen the fake me.I was with my ex for 3 years and after a lot of research and trying to self heal I have learned the term grooming and learned that was done to me. Out of a sense of love and obligation I allowed myself to basically be stripped of anything good about me or anything I liked or had any interest in in order to be loved and liked to have a family. Long story short I lost myself and I did not talk to any friends or family for 3 years and after getting back to them I feel as if I am always auditioning and I am back to doing anything just to have someone around me but now I know that I am not being liked for me and anytime I ever show anything that is truly me I somehow validate my negative thoughts and rationalize them to be right and I know that is wrong but I am 24/7 screaming in my head fighting with thoughts and screaming at me to stop and begging just for some help and weed barely helps anymore. I do not want to drink but drinking is about the only time now when I do not feel sad. And I am able to literally drown out the thoughts. And i cry everytime I think about anything because I now know how sad Thais all is and the fact that no one knows except i started telling my mom a tiny bit about the negative thoughts and voices and now all I can think about is how me telling her worried her and scared her and I hate myself even more now and I genuinely did not think that was possible. The problem is, that I do not think I am ad guy or anything like I played plenty of sports growing up and had lots of friends and was popular I guess I had plenty of girlfriends and was actually liked by people and friends but I do not where that went I do not feel like him I do not feel me. I literslly do not feel like me. The only time I ever do is en I am all alone like iwatch videos or listen to music loud enough to anyone can hear it so that thEy do not think I am weird or I do not honestly even know I just do not want to be alone anymore I want to be liked and wanted for me and I do not see that happening ever. I feel too much pressure to even talk to anyone let alone be around them for longer than a passing by. I feel as If I am being shown pity anytime anyone talks to me or is around me. I feel as if its all just to make me feel better. Vs actually wanting to be around me for me. I do not think I am good anymore and I think its over honestly. I am just so tired of everything and the pressures and the feelings that come with literally opening my mouth or being around anyone. If I am not alone I cannot laugh without crying on the inside. I literally stop myself from laughing or feeling good by non stop negative thoughts pounding in my head and I scream and scream stop and help but I cannot get them out. I rationalize all of them and believe them to be logical and true and I am even in more pain that I am already in. I am so tireeeed please help actually I do not need help I just want to be wanted? No one understand the person I am. I try to express myself at times and it only ever leads to others getting hurt from my feelings.

13020,"Honestly, this is my first reddit post. I have never felt this way before. The story starts way back about a year ago. I have felt some sorts of depression throughout my early teens and have experimented with extremely high (retarded in fact) doses of OTC medication to see the effects and what would happen with the goal of not waking up over some stupid shit I honestly should not have been stressed about. Some dumb ass shit like getting yelled at or getting in trouble. I have been diagnosed with ADHD since elementary school and have been pumped up with adderall and melatonin everyday in order to just act remotely normal and behave. Around the beginning of high school I stopped everything completely and did act out a bit in school and with my parents, but nothing severe. I then started smoking weed, and a lot of it. I was high for probably 3 years of my life straight. Every morning, and every night I would get absolutely blasted in order to just keep to myself and not because any trouble (and a good nights rest). I vividly recall in grade 10 trying to stop smoking and I did not touch anything for a full week and I felt out of it and fried for the whole week so I just kept it going. I started to sell to keep up with my habits, and that is when my parents caught on. I would lash out and just be a brat towards my whole family. In grade 12 I failed my first 2 classes of the year and was not on track to graduate. My parents kicked me out, and I left the country to stay with close family. I was doing all my classes online and had great success. I decided to go towards the route of Engineering (specifically software) and got straight A's in all of the prerequisites needed for university. I took a full year (8 classes) of online high school and finished them all in a semester. I enrolled in university conditionally for the program and am just finishing up my last finals in order to upgrade my university classes (I also graduated high school early and got my transcript). The problem is when I came my family would just shit on me and say it was all my fault I got in this position, and that if I did not change I would kill my parents. I would finish my work and in turn I would get liquor on the weekends to celebrate a job well done. At this point I was studying 14+ hours a day, 7 days a week with no days off. At this point for a long time I was drinking on my own to cope with myself and help me sleep (keep in mind I have been out of the country away from my families house since the beginning of the school year). My family I am staying with took my phone and went through my group chats and found old snaps of me smoking with my friends and what not, and took my phone away. I have not talked to my parents, or my friends in around 8 or 9 months, with the exception of my parents calling my family and in those situations they would mute the phone and force me to smile, say everything was alright, and give the phone back to them so my parents would not suspect anything. Around 2 months ago when I graduated I started hanging out with my cousins and partying, and that is when my family found out I did cocaine, smoked lots with them, and drank regularly. Currently I am not addicted or dependent on anything, but I am at the lowest point of my life. I life my whole life wrapped around the finger of my family. I can not watch tv, listen to music, work out, hang out with my family, or even take elongated breaks to eat or take a shower. My family is planning to have a road trip back to my home country to drop me off to my parents, but I truly do not see myself seeing my parents, friends, or family ever again. I genuinely do not see myself going to university, or even going home. Currently I just wake up at 4:30, and study until 8:30 with 15 minute breaks to eat and take a shower before I sleep. I used to love talking to people and eating and hanging out, now I only feel remotely content by myself. I feel no urge to eat, I feel no contentness with my life, and I am overwhelmed with guilt for all the pain and suffering I have caused my family back home. I have zero appetite and like fucking clock work I puke my guts out every morning at 7:30. My family forces me to eat and I can not hold anything down. I am rapidly losing weight, and am losing the urge to live. I know I am for sure missing a lot out and it may be mixed up, this last year has been the craziest year of my life, but I think I got all the main bits in. I was just wondering if anyone felt this way, and if anybody thinks I am crazy, or being driven to that point. My family assures me its all my fault, and my lack of appetite is me screaming for attention and I am a attention seeking bitch, but I truly feel no urge to eat, and every day they just yell at me worse and worse and it pushes me closer and closer to the edge of killing myself. I truly am at rock bottom, and ready to end it all. I live my life in darkness, with nothing to look forward to, and no light in sight. Please let me know what I should do. Can anyone relate?",Suicidal
13025,"I have always had the thought of killing myself. Ever since I would have to say 5th grade. But as they say, when those thoughts coming into your mind at such a young age they are not serious. I think this is what started my suicidal thoughts though. Having them brought into my mind at such a young age and then not being properly analyzed. It was more of a brush it off thing. So now I sit here at just 25 years of old recently.. things may have gotten better slightly before high school ended. Then as soon as it was over.. the downhill spiral seemed to accelerate x15. Right now I would not mind me passing at literally any given moment. From where I sit I do not see any possible way to create an incline for myself. A little more background is I used to be a drug addict. I worked the clinic program instead of the 12 steps because personally I find some of the steps total horseshit (not all). But with that being said as of the past month Id say I was at the last third of my treatment. And I got to do what I always do Fuck it up. I used and I hate myself so much more now. There was no point in going on the stupid 2 week bender that I did but now that I did it. I have backtracked myself 8 months. Do you know how devastating that is. To me Its almost enough to just say fuck it because to have that possibly happen again I would be wasting my own lifealong with the others who genuinely tried to help me along the way.

I used to think nothing of my extreme lack of energy lately but its getting frustrating. I cannot find the energy to leave my house, most days I stay in my room all day, only leaving to get food or go to the toilet. I am struggling severely to keep up basic hygiene, showering is my biggest challenge at the moment. Horses are my favourite animal, and I volunteer at a stables and now I cannot even bring myself to stay there for over 10 minutes. I have been dodging my friends messages and making up so many excuses to avoid going outside to her and i cannot understand why its so hard. I am overweight, i hate my body with a fucking passion but i cannot stop eating. My confidence is at the lowest its ever been and i cannot stand to see myself in the mirror. I do not want to die but I get so angry and so violent so fast now and i feel the only way i can take out my anger is by cutting which is becoming a habit. I feel repulsed by my cuts and I am too embarrassed to tell my mum and/or my doctor. I tried to work up the courage to tell him but I could not find the balls to bring it up. I told my friend a few days back that I am in an awful place mentally and she laughed it off and told me to stop being dramatic because her life is worse. I am getting addicted to hurting myself as a punishment and i feel myself slowly slipping away from everyone and everything i love. I have cried myself to sleep for about 2 months now. Sometimes I feel Id be better off dead but I am too scared and I cannot leave my little brother. My mum thinks I am being a slob and she keeps calling me shit like fat whore, dirty pig, lazy bitch, the list goes on.

Every time I try to speak my mind and not be so quiet, I say stuff so terrible, sick, awkward, and pathetic that neurotypicals are quick to put me down and make me feel terrible for existing. Well guess what, I DO feel terrible for existing in the first place!I cannot even fight them. I used to try and beat up anyone that bullied me in school, but I would either lose or beat them so hard out of senseless anger that I get suspended or threatened with expulsion, while the bully gets no punishment. That would eventually lead to the first suicide attempt and hospitalization. I have been hospitalized eight times for suicidal/homicidal ideation and attempts, and I have gone to prison before for one of those times. Point is, I deserve the worst death possible. that is why I was about to swallow this entire bottle of Hydroxyzine Pamoate, at ~275 capsules of 25mg each, that should at least give me the pain I deserve, if not kill me.

Ill even carve a suicide note out of my blood saying I REGRET NOTHING and give it to him as a tip.I am making this thread out of the small sliver of hope for life I still have, but it seems I have already tried everything.

13042,"My partner and I are both 18 and recently just finished high school (we are together for almost 2 years now). We also just finished applying for different colleges and results came out today; I failed and she passed. Initially of course, I felt happy for her. Though passing that school did not mean anything for her, it is obvious that she is going to choose the school which is the top school in the country, over a school that both of us passed and could go together.I have mixed feelings about it to be honest. Initially like I said, I felt a sudden burst of happiness because she deserves that success. Followed by that I felt a teeny bit of jealousy, because it is my dream school ever since I was a child, and ever since we have became couples/partners, she has been part of my dream too. I dreamt that I could go to the same college as she would and finish together. We were classmates for 2 years during highschool and I think I have grown so attached to her that I do not even want her to leave me anymore.But I know better. I know that people should prioritize themselves first and their future before anything else and I get that. But to be honest, I am really scared right now. I am scared that we will not experience the same college moments as we had in high school, I am scared that she might meet new people, and I am scared about what could happen to her and I would not be there to guide her.Ever since I got the news of failing and ever since I have thought about these thoughts, my world just kept falling apart.

13043,"For the last couple of days or a week ago my mental state starts to wavering. I have a habit of bottling things, and I am incredibly ashamed of not being functional nor useful. My partner, knowing that one of my episodes was coming up, tried his best to be there, comforting me, and given me a reality check. The more he cares, the more I am ashamed of being so low and useless. It was also a coincidence where we decided to stay an entire night through to restart our bio-clock (due to us being night-owls, its an eventual fact that we would end up waking somewhere between 3-5pm before) and also taking care of packing and preparations for university. The morning after making the night through I had an embarrassing panic attack while in a crowded open market. My boyfriend was beyond amazing at handling the mess that was me, and it helped for quite a bit. However, my mood soon went down again, with a phone call from my sibling broke me to my end. I became a leech, refusing to tell my bf what is wrong, getting irritated when he tries to show me something (we were playing chess), and overall I was trying my best to not makes him more worried, with that backfired horrendously. My bf end up getting sick of my misery, said he tried everything but nothing worked, and he is beyond drained. I started getting angry and spiral even harder, thinking that I was right for bottling myself up, to not share my problems because of the damage I made. When I saw that he threw the chessboard in the trash, something snapped. I self-harmed, weeping for apologies, and upon seeing that I was only a nuisance, wanted to flung myself out of the balcony. that is the kind of things a 17 years old girl would do, and besides we live on the 4th floor, so you will not die. Also I have to clean the mess (my corpse or blood) afterwards, and I really do not want to. There is the next building which you can jump off from the 7th floor, and if you want I can walk you to there, but I am not cleaning the mess up. quote from my bf, which he is right. That unfortunately makes me spiral even harder, feeling like a defected tool, and must be eradicated. Afterwards, even now I am trying to find a suitable cleaning group, so my bf will not need to clean up my mess if I did end up jumping. I am now in an ultimatum where if I leave the bedroom or from his sight, its a clean breakup. I am still confused why he is more upset when I said he does not need to take care of anything, he does not need to clean my mess. At the end, the two nights to restart our bioclock was a failure, my bf is burned out entirely and it was my fault and my unnecessary drama. I am sitting here fighting in my head in shame a guilt, trying to not kill myself. But knowing that problems, nuisances and burdens need to be eradicated, so everyone around me (including my bf) would be happy again I am constantly crying and trying not to kill myself.I am not sure if he would break up with me, and I will not blame him if he does, but I am desperately need to be the functional and hard working gf again, or I have to eradicate myself for good to contain the failures and burdens from spreading again to my bf.Long story short, shitty depressive gf bothers her bf to the mac with her pretentious suicide attempt.

13055,"Hi, I am looking for some words of advice and comfort here.A month ago, during an argument, my boyfriend (24M) revealed to me (22F) that he is suicidal. He was furious to have said it and became upset with me for having brought the truth out from him. I was never under the impression that I acted inappropriately at the time, but over time I realized I disrespected a boundary I had no idea existed. I made a mistake I have so much trouble understanding. And a part of me was relieved that he told me-- I also learned he has been seeing a therapist for a year, but after the argument he told me he was no longer interested in therapy. Since this happened, my boyfriend and I have not seen each other. we have known each other for three years and have dated long distance through the pandemic. We initially continued seeing each other (long distance, zoom and facetime) to play videogames and talk about our days as if nothing was wrong, but my emotions kept ""getting in the way."" But from the beginning of this crisis, he said he could no longer trust me or the relationship because he cannot bear to think about the problem and my fear and sadness are extremely upsetting because they cast doubts on his recovery. I understand where he is coming from and objectively, the nature of an intimate relationship goes against his desire for distraction and levity -- I have accepted this. We have started a two-week no contact break this week. Before then, I did everything I could to communicate my understanding and faith in him and his recovery, even though I cried due to my anxiety about the situation. But he has been so strong and sought out help before-- I must believe he has the courage to overcome this. As I am someone who struggled with depression and some suicidal ideation too, it breaks my heart to know my boyfriend is suffering like this -- and that I only found out now. I know I brought joy into his life, but without ever knowing truly how dark his mind could be, I am distraught that he must have felt disconnected and alone.I deeply understand I am not *the* solution to his problem. I am working through the paralyzing fear of being unable to do anything for him. Again, he only wants distraction now. We are currently on a break to sort out whether he wants to continue in the relationship. We continue to affirm our love and care for one another. As you might understand, the flux of our relationship interacts very poorly with the intense sadness and anxiety about his personal suffering. I do not know whether I should stay or go, regardless of his decision. I am determined to accept what he wants but I am scared if what is to come is a lifetime of not knowing if he is okay. it is an impossible problem and I am just waiting for a sign. I love him so much and can only pray for him to recognize his strength -- to find whatever he needs. My anxiety gets in the way of my seeing signs of hope and reassurance -- he tells me he is keeping himself stable my continuing to see friends and do activities--I trust that is exactly what he needs, it might be just fine to put off the deeper work it might take to overcome his sadness. Really, I might just be terrifying myself for no reason. My therapist and family tell me it will all be okay because he told me about his suicidality. And he did so in some detail. Even though he was angry, I could not help but feel he might be relieved to share his dark thoughts. And I cannot breathe a word of this to his family or friends, because they would make it worse by wanting to talk about this problem with him, when he absolutely does not want to. This also is a bit scary for me, but I can understand why it has to be this way.I know there is not much I can do but manage my own anxiety. I am learning and adapting, and finding strength. I hope he does exactly what he needs and that the outcome of his decision can preserve his happiness. I found out my boyfriend is suicidal and I am terrified",Suicidal

I do not know if I will make it to 25 I cannot imagine continuing to live my life like this. I am so useless I serve no purpose and if I stopped existing people would hardly notice. I doubt anyone is still reading and this was just me shouting into the void. What I have wrote probably does not make sense and is filled with mistakes but I do not care. I just want to be happy and like myself. If I could start from the beginning I would but you only get one chance and I have fucked it. I am just sick of it all. I do not know who I am what my identity is what my purpose is. I am lonely and honestly scared and confused its not fair that I have to live like this despite being a good person at my core.I am lost. To be honest I just cannot get the girl out of my head, this is the first time in my life I have had feelings like this and it is forced me to reflect on myself and try to find what went wrong. It feels like I was born to lose. I am destined to die alone and i do not know how to avoid that fate. Again I doubt anyone is still reading and this probably makes no sense but I thought I would try putting my thoughts into words. Off my chest",Depression
13084,"A lot of the time, my depression just feels like a weight on my chest, always slowing me down, always holding me back. Always stopping me right before I get started. I have learned to live with that, though, and most of the time I can push through it to do what I need to do.But sometimes it gets so fucking frustrating that I have to deal with this for the rest of my life. I just want to be able to handle situations like everyone else. I just want to be able to use my emotional and physical energy without having to worry about feeling drained from it immediately.it is like, I cannot even THINK about my future without getting this unbearable wave of dread and guilt and exhaustion. All I can say to myself is ""I do not want to do this anymore"" because everything is just too much. I am not cut out for this world and I cannot keep fighting like this forever. it is so fucking hard. Everything is so fucking hard. Every morning, when I wake up from my dreams, it feels like I am stepping back into the real nightmare. I cannot keep doing this every single fucking day for the rest of my life.I just want to fuck off into the woods or something. If I cannot do anything in society, I just want to go be useless in the woods and maybe die out there or something. I hate that people are counting on me and I hate that people love me. I cannot do this anymore, I never asked for any of this, and I want to fucking die. fed up with this",Depression

13095,"Half vent, half a genuine question. How would one learn to make a routine to function semi-normally? I have recently overcome one of my most severe depressive episodes, but I feel myself falling back in. I do not know how to function normally. I have tried adding things one by one and scheduling timers for every step of a morning routine but I do not get how people can actually have time in a day to do everything they want. How do people find a balance? I need to get up at around 5:30 in the morning, but I have been falling asleep at 5am for years. I do not know how I can fit brushing my teeth and washing my face and showering and eating and working out and f\*cking everything else into a 1.5 hour period before I have to leave. And once I get home, how do I balance schoolwork and my social life? How do I develop a night routine? Functioning normally is overwhelming. I have 2 weeks to learn how to do it and I feel like the stress is going to set me back further than I already am. How do people make time for everything in a day?",Depression
13098,"I do not feel like an actual person. Normal people find fulfillment in things and I just do not. I have been taking medication and it does not work, I do not take medication and nothing seems different. I just feel like I am empty. I was sitting here today, wondering what I should be living for, and aside from making sure that no one feels guilty or sad about me leaving, I did not have an answer. I feel like I graduated from college for nothing. I feel like the job I found I got for no reason as I did not feel good about having it and now I am going to lose it because of failing at keeping my grades up. it is weird because I am more upset at the idea of others thinking I am a failure than having actually failed. I did not even want to do all of this in the first place, I just did it because it felt like I was supposed to. I feel like shit that I worked this hard just to do things I never wanted so the people in my life could feel like they did right by me. My whole life is just this big blur and it is a hard pill to swallow, knowing I never truly lived for myself even when I was younger. it is weird how the most important time of our development is spent doing things that do not even matter to us. Well at least to me. I am starting to think I was never normal to begin with. I never did things because it is what I liked, I did them because it was socially acceptable. I did not feel accomplished when I got good grades because it meant I did well, I felt accomplished because someone thought I accomplished something. I continue to accumulate these pieces of paper telling me I did something correct only to stare at it and feel nothing. I mean that is what some of the better jobs think anyway so it makes sense. it is not enough. It means nothing. And then I think, maybe, I did not even have enough willpower to work anyway. I have just been tired from the beginning and waiting for it to all end like a black screen at the end of a movie. And then I will just get up and walk away. Or maybe I will stay seated and it will be a black screen forever.I think ahead sometimes like, ""Oh, well maybe I can find a nice guy, get married, have a kid, maybe travel"" and then I look at everyone around me and see that they have all done it so maybe that is why I want to do it. And then I get this feeling of already having done it because I have seen it done so many times all the way to its finish. I do not even know why I am typing here anymore. I do not even know why part of my brain wants me to keep going when I already know how some things might play out. I do not know why I would want to stick around to see everyone older than me die first. Recently when I think about getting another job it scares me because it just means I am going to another place where everyone else matters except for me again. It will always be for the sake of someone else that I am working. That I am living. Even eating is a chore that I really do not do because it is just so bothersome and annoying. But starving is also annoying because it hurts a lot. But thinking also hurts. I am not even 30 yet and this is how everything feels. it is horrible. It just hurts. I feel like I cannot talk to anyone because depression is this big epidemic that is spreading in every generation. I keep picturing how I am going to kill myself and then I get bored and stare into space. I keep picturing doing something more important with my life and then I get bored and stare into space. This is not a life to live but if I die I am afraid someone is going to miss me. People who feel things that are not sadness should be allowed to feel happy. I just feel so sad and when I am not feeling sad I feel nothing. it is getting kind of dangerous. I am really thinking it is about to happen. I am really about to kill myself. And I cry because I know it is true. I know I do not care anymore. I know they are going to hold some funeral for me where people are going to cry and be upset despite my life being really simple and kind of sad. there is nothing out here for someone like me. Jobs feel wrong, friends feel wrong, sex feels wrong, family feels wrong, it all just feels wrong. I do not think I was supposed to be born.I guess I just wanted someone to know.

I feel constantly in a dissociative state. I am going to go to the doctors tomorrow and try to get some help. I am also quitting porn because it is fucking me up big time.

You would being doing all of us a favor. I know you are on antidepressants and other stuff so we would like for you stop making our lives miserable if you would hurry this along.

I do not have any kind of physical disease or look weird, I am ""normal""... but I just cannot handle it. If you cannot tell, I am socially anxious (in real life, I am fine on the internet &amp; online spaces/games) and not the normal kind of anxious, but a genuine feeling of fear.

13114,"I have noticed that talking about my depression and anxiety does not really give me the greatest results. This especially holds true in romantic relationships. I have told just about every woman I have dated I have struggled with mental health and all of those relationships ended. I told them partly because it was all that was on my mind, partly because I wanted comfort, but also a part of me thought I should be honest and transparent about it and that somehow it would be appreciated. I think I have bought into this notion that men should be more vulnerable and talk about their feelings. For a while I legitimately thought whining about my feelings was the right thing to do, despite how dumb that may sound, because no one told me otherwise. I also reasoned that If a woman talked to me about her mental health struggles, that should be an invitation to talk about mine. I had a mental breakdown in front of my current girlfriend. Things are fine now but she told me she does not want me to constantly talk about my anxiety because she also has anxiety and it stresses her out. A few years ago I would have gotten really mad and upset, but I can now understand why that would not be something that a woman would want me to talk about all the time. I said okay that makes sense, and we moved on from there. I genuinely appreciated the feedback, because it was information that was helpful and would allow me to course correct my behavior. After that interaction there was a rough patch but things seem fine now. Every interaction I have had with her since then I have made it a point to be more confident and I sense that she is more attracted to me because of it. I really aspire to not bring up my anxiety and depression to her anymore. I will say one caveat though, if something catastrophic happens Ill talk about it. Some people may say I should just find another woman who understands, but I do not really think a lot of women out there want that out of a man. If I stormed away from her and found someone else to whine to, the same thing might happen. It might even be worse. I think she cares but she does not want to play the role of a therapist.Anyway, I have been reading a lot about personality traits, and the one trait that is not helpful in any situation is neuroticism. All the literature says people who have this trait struggle immensely in romantic relationships, and I believe this would explain my prior struggles. Disconcertingly, its been said that it is almost impossible to change your personality traits, but I am trying to implement tactics that will at least help and I do believe I have made significant progress over the past few years. I just have a long way to go. The thing is, I want to be in a stable romantic relationship, and I am to the point where I would rather just hide my neuroticism and act like a manly, confident man, than allow my neurotic tendencies to be integrated into my interactions with my girlfriend. On the surface this may seem dishonest, but I truly believe the one thing that is causing me trouble in relationships is my neuroticism. If I can keep that at bay while continuing to work on improving by myself, that is what I intend to do. I really do not but this vulnerability crap anymore. I just do not believe women are attracted to it. Maybe if its done tactfully its okay, but when you are at a really low spot its very difficult to do that. I really think my only solution towards a long term relationship is to suck it up and be a man. I know this sounds inauthentic but I really do not want to be an old lonely guy in my 60s or 70s with no wife, kids, or family. If displaying my neuroticism leads to that outcome, I will gladly suppress it all day long. On a side note, I believe that the fact that I can avoid showing my neuroticism is an indication that I am improving. In the past I would not have been able to hide it no matter hard I would try. I am absolutely committed to doing everything I can to improve my mental health from here on out, despite how insurmountable it may look. TL;DR I am willing to hide my mental health issues in order to have a relationship. Talking about my depression causes bad outcomes in relationships",Depression
13117,"I am not really sure if this is normal or what, but literally all I can ever seem to think about is how useless I am. I think it is slowly making me go crazy, or something. I am already so insecure and all the people around me seem to be so much more intelligent than I am. I used to be smart, but around a few years ago, everything just started to feel less and less real, and so I just had much less incentive to care, and so less reasons to find things to think deeply about. Now, all I can think about is how much more everyone else around me has accomplished. I genuinely do not understand how people think normally on a day-to-day basis. Is this normal, and am I just making it a bigger deal than it actually is? Regardless of what I am doing, somehow I always find a way to feel terrible about myself about it. Like, for example, if I am watching a show, I will feel like I am not ""enjoying it right"", and that I am interpreting the show wrong and that I am not enjoying it in the same way everyone else is. I do not know if this is normal or not. I have been like this so long that I do not know anymore All I can think about 24/7 is how useless I am",Depression

13120,"I was born with a broken brain. I had very severe OCD as a child, which consumed all of my thoughts and made me very depressed and ruined my childhood. I showed signs of depression when I was six. I remember not wanting to live when I was *six-years-old*. How fucked up is that? This of course continued throughout my teen years. Lots of OCD symptoms were gone (some still remain) but the depression and anxiety just got worse. Same thing as an adult. I am 29 now, and I do not know how much longer I can go on. The last three years of my life have been hell. A lot of things have happened that I had no control over. My love life has never been great. Finally, I met the man of my dreams four months before the pandemic. Long story short, the pandemic complicated a lot of things, he broke up with me, we had to live together for a month after and he turned into a different person during that time. It was shocking. He was so *mean* to me. I just tried to stay out of the way and not be a burden. He never apologized and continues to break my heart in many different ways. Whenever I try to explain this situation to anyone, I always get a lot of ""tough love"" and harsh comments that just do not help and they make things worse. I do not need coddling, but I have gone through every scenario in my head while lying awake at night. Those comments are things I have already said to myself a million times and I do not need someone else saying them to me too. People also think the relationship thing is trivial. It is, but to me, it is not. Some people's life goal is to have the career they want. My goal is to find a loving partner to share life with. I am fine with my career right now. I think both goals should be respected, but often times, my goal is not. that is far from the only thing. I have PMDD, which makes me suicidal before my period. A lot of deaths of people close to me have happened. I have had issues with unstable housing (landlords selling and kicking me out). My catalytic converter was stolen and it cost 3k. I even saw part of the theft while walking to my car. There is so much more, but I do not want to bore anyone. Something happened recently and my friend was like ""Why are not you freaking out?"" and it was because I was just used to bad things happening to me. Even my therapist was like ""Wow, that is a lot of stuff in a short amount of time"" (there are a lot of things I have not listed in this post). I know many people have it a lot worse than me. For some reason, my mom likes to bring that up to ""cheer"" me up but it just makes it worse. I do not want other people to suffer and it makes me sad to hear about their suffering. It seems like all there is is bad news in the world. I have tried to be proactive about reading positive things, but honestly, there is not a lot. My job involves reading and writing about real murders all day. I love my job and I am happy to have it, but this takes it is emotional toll too. But it is really not about how many bad things happen to me, it is the fact that no matter how hard I try, my brain cannot react in the correct way. Things gnaw at me that a ""normal"" person can cope with and handle. The PMDD makes it so I cannot see ANY goodness at all. I am blinded by sadness and anger. I have tried to fight it, but my hormones are stronger than me. I try so hard to fix myself--I see a therapist regularly and I take the medication I have been prescribed dutifully, but for some reason, my brain just cannot make me feel good. I get accused a lot of not trying to be happy. I wish they knew how hard I have tried every single day. The PMDD also makes me extremely suicidal. For a week every month, I am in a war with my mind. I try to fight against the urge to do it. But every month I feel like I am getting weaker and weaker, and I am afraid my mind is going to win soon. This post is all over the place, sorry.

I have tried having a talk with myself but that just makes me write down things from the self-talk and make another checklist.

13150,"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",Depression

And looking back on everything just makes me realise how miserable my life really was, I have realised how shitty my family was and also all things I have missed out on in life that all my (ex) friends got to experience. Looking back on everything makes me feel so weird and life feels so alien to me now. Its like a feeling of nostalgia but in such a depressing, ugly, gross form. Its also making me feel conflicted, as if I do not know who I am or have been, nor what I want. I cannot even tell if I want to be happy or not. It also feels like my life is flashing before my eyes and that my life is coming to an end soon. At the same time I have been having anxiety of the world ending and being apart from the person I love, but I am not sure if the two are connected. Either way I am thinking so much about life and death right nowI've tried looking for answers but I have not gotten any. I do not understand any of this, I am 14 and I have been depressed since I was 10 but I have never experienced something this low before. I cannot tell if its an existential crisis or not but it is so fucking depressing my lord.

My mother cannot work - health issues. We will not be able to make ends meet. I need to consume my scholarship again. I will call the dentist at 9 to quit my appointment. Classic.I open my eyes. The online university is about to go down. Here comes the autumn. I need to keep my grades up at the top.

There is no panicking and no stress into getting rid of it. The scars and deformities already took everything. Is that Peyronie's disease? What about my broken tooth? Oh no, anyways. I open my eyes. I got one message. it is one of my colleagues. A differential equation is not working out. The dopamine is rising up in my brain. I am being needed. My existence matters for a moment. I am never wanted, so this is the best I can get. I solved it. She thanked me. I am no longer needed. I am now lonely. I open my eyes. I am a man. I can only like other men. I am an abomination - for my ""family"", for my ""friends"", for my colleagues, for my country, probably for the reader. I am protected tho. There is a wall between me and their hatred - my ability to hinder. Is it actually an ability? The idea of a partner is more than unrealistic. Looks do not matter, but no one wants a beast outside a tale. Personality is more important, but what is it expected for someone who grew chained up. I open my eyes. it is completely dark. I am about to go to sleep. That will not happen soon. I am thinking. I am about to finish college. I am about to break the poverty chain. My career is the only thing that went right in my life. Will I be able to start over? I am afraid. I do not want my last hope to let me down. I feel like I have lost too much in life. I feel like a second-grader at NASA. One that is expected to learn everything just by hanging around. Seems so easy for my scientist advisers, so hard for me. What about the thing about me that I cannot change?

I do not have savings, in fact I am in debt not even counting soon-to-be crippling student loans. I have wasted my time on boozing or weed benders just to feel something because when I do not I cannot escape the suicidal thoughts. My family all think it but do not have the balls to say it to me. I cannot even take the bare minimum fucking steps of medical/dental appointments. I am still plagued by the fallout of my mom turning from a quirky hippie chick into a schizo methhead, and my subsequent fall from a bright kid going to the stem school and winning chess tournaments into a useless stoner fucker who cannot function in society.it is enough to want to just lay down and fucking rot. Why the fuck do i have to experience these deep, dark, depressions. I used to think it was loneliness. Then I thought it was fallout from my childhood.

I was nice, sometimes being too nice to the point I agree with everyone else's opinions no matter what it was. I thought when people were mean it meant they chose to be. But now that you ask I realize it might not be the only reason. I had little to no patience for anything. I lived in a constant state of anxiety and worry.

She said that she wants to break up (she said it a lot before, along with other painful stuff), and I kind of just listened and deleted her, broke up... Now I regret it... What confused me was her unblocking me (I was blocked from our main chat before break up) right after the breakup, even though she wanted it. She has not messaged me and since yesterday is talking to our best mutual friend. All I know is she doubts the decision to break up and is indecisive and wants time to think... Now with that little hope I cannot even move on or anything, waiting is killing me, I still love her and I want her back and I am tormented with the thought of her saying that she will stick to the decision to break up.....

I am tired all the time and fed up with the world. I want to disengage from it; already isolated myself from most my friends. Before I felt isolated from my age group because I was too childish, but now I feel isolated because I feel too old for /all this/. I feel like my life is nearing its end and I do not want to go on. I just go day to day without doing much at all because things do not excite me like they used to. Sometimes I look in the mirror and check if I am growing wrinkles or white hair because I wonder if my outside will reflect my inside. Why do I feel old? Did something happen to my psychology?

13188,"I am frustrated. that is the constant theme with my life. I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity. My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted ""some job I could tolerate"" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against ""the enemy"" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives. In a sense I am back where I was before. Just waiting to die. Wanting to ""just get by"" long enough to finally be rid of it. I hate this. Just want to get out of everyone is way",Depression

13192,"Long one, thanks for reading..I was going a moderate depression. My therapist and gf suggested I take a medical leave, but I was concerned about having those free extra hours to drive me crazy, and about my career. Gf suggested she could work from my place and keep me company. And if I felt anxious, she would be there. I accept the idea of the leave, and immediately become a different person. Therapy does wonders without the anxiety of work, and the cloud of depression is gone. The little voice tellling me everything will go wrong and Ill be alone is gone. I feel safe. I feel happy. I feel hope.Two days before the medical leave, she asked me when she gets to meet my parents. Big step! But it just makes me happier, my life is going somewhere, the depression is lessening exponentially, and I have clearly met someone that loves me.The day before the leave begins, she dumps me via text. It had been 9 months. Of course, I went from moderately anxious and depressed, to severely so. However, at least, she promises she will still be with me every step of the way, and I could call whenever. I start a PHP, which is more intensive group therapy. On day 3 of the PHP, they pull me out of therapy to tell me I am clearly too depressed for their program and they might have to release me, aka kick me out. I did not mention any suicidal thoughts, but I guess they saw something in my attitude. I freak out, even the people that are supposed to help me tell me I am too broken for them. I am in crisis and scared and my ex comes over. She spends the whole day with me, about 10 hours. She tells me she is in love with me, that she will be there. Day 4 of the PHP: they kick me out. I text my ex, and she responds asking me to delete her number and that she cannot help me anymore. In the span of 5 minutes, I lose my entire support system. I become suicidal.I get worse and worse, and start making plans. That scares me so much I text my ex regardless, being honest about it: this is not about getting her back, or a manipulation tactic this is a human being that is terrified. She made promises that allowed me to depend and lean on her, and broke them all. I understand giving an ex space, but I am also fighting (and losing) for my life, so I do not think its that disrespectful of her space. She never responds.My mother discovers how bad I am and stays with me. She helps with daily life stuff, but I am way too broken. I keep thinking of my exs behavior as a betrayal. I tell myself this is proof that I cannot count on anyone, that my life will always suck. My mother hugs me, I feel nothing. I keep getting worse, and have an episode where I just went catatonic. she would talk to me and I would not respond, forget about eating. did not move for hours. She gets so scared she calls a friend of mine. Same deal, hugs me, says hes here for me, but it does not nothing for me. The damage of the betrayal seems to have put me past repair.I get hospitalized, but when sent back home immediately feel as before. I just lost the ability to hope, and be affected by others. I wake up crying. I do that all day until I go to sleep.. still crying. Sometimes I stop crying, but its out of exhaustion, not having gotten anything out. Sometimes because I scream while I cry and my throat hurts too much. This goes on for 2 weeks. I swallow my pride, and beg my ex for help. If no one can get to me, maybe she can. If the betrayal can be undone, maybe Ill stop seeing the world as my enemy. She did promise.. but no response.After the third week, my mother in desperation calls her. We know its bad, we know its not healthy, but this is starting to be life or death. She created a dependency with her promises and it broke my mind, my mother hopes that I will react to her.Ex shows concern for a moment, calls (although my mom did not hear the phone). My mother calls back, but it goes straight to voicemail, and we never hear back. She blocked her too..I have done everything. The drugs, the hospital, the PHP, the medical leave. My support system is not helping me, not through fault of their own, they just cannot get me to move or eat or feel anything. I get no warmth from their hugs. We disrespected my exs boundaries in desperation hoping she would make a difference, but she apparently has left me to die. I have done it all. I want it to end. I have begun planning for it, and its destroying my family. I could get hospitalized yet again, but the underlying issue always returns: the betrayal broke me. I had plenty of other issues (physical health, work, pandemic), but was still getting better, fought against it all. Until the betrayal. It does not seem like I can get out of this one. I am out of energy, and I am out of a fight. I just want out I was almost out of the woods, then someone kicked me down and everyday I think about ending things",Suicidal
13197,"So, I have struggled with major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, bpd, and I strongly believe adhd (it runs in the family and I have a lot of symptoms but I am not a doctor of course) for a long time now. I have done everything from therapy twice a week to countless medications. I quit my job a month ago because things hit a real low for myself and for this entire month, I have not really gotten out of bed for much. I joined this forum a couple days ago, and reading everyone is stories has been absolutely heartbreaking. It made me really feel like shit because here I am struggling to get off my ass and get out of bed, when people have it so much worse than me. When things were going really well for me, I decided to go to college and pursue a dream of mine. So I am signed up to start in the fall. Slowly but surely these past few days I have been kicking myself to get out of bed and take the steps to get better, because I have dreams, and I do not want to miss out on an amazing life because I am mentally ill. I want to document my progress because I want to be able to look back and be like it really did get better. This forum has really lit a fire under me, because I am so enraged at how depression and anxiety and all these mental illnesses get to come in and ruin peoples lives. No one deserves this. So here is my question: if I were to start a YouTube channel and upload my progress and what helps me and show my ups and downs and bumps in the road, would that help people? Because if I could touch or motivate just one soul, or be the one reason to try for someone, I would put everything out there. I think mental health is so hushed and it should not be. Its such a big problem and we need to talk about it and be aware of it. Obviously I am not a professional, but that is why maybe it would help? If people saw how badly I was struggling but I was still able to kick depressions ass? Idk. Its just a thought. And I know its risky to share that stuff with the public, but I just want to help people, ya know? because people have it so much worse than I ever imagined. And so many people feel alone and I do not want them to. Please be kind to me. I am just honestly asking. If people do not think its a good idea or if they can point out reasons that I cannot see for why its bad, then obviously Ill have my answer: do not do it. All I want is to help other people while helping myself if I can. Please be kind!! I have a question..",Depression
13198,"I have had my parakeet named Bonnie for 5 years but a few months ago she got sick so I took her to the vet and they told me she had a cyst on her and to give her antibiotics, she had a visible bump on her where the cyst was and she was acting sick for around 6 or 7 months, I took her to the vet when she first started acting sick and they gave her antibiotics but yesterday I found her just sitting at the bottom of the cage in the dark in the middle of the night, once I came in the room she got back up on the perch and I was worried about her so I stayed up all night watching her and she kept going down to the bottom and looked like she was having a hard time staying up on the perch so in the morning I asked my mom to take her to the vet and she said we should move her to a smaller cage to fit in the car more easily, while my mom was moving her Bonnie kept yelling at her and then she died shortly after. I am very depressed now and I feel like it was my fault for having my mom move her. I miss her so much My parakeet died yesterday and now I am depressed",Depression
13199,"I am a goddamn clown, by day I repress and by night I cannot.Now I have just had the incredible luck of receiving a family member's call at night, I have of course been told to take meds and go get myself locked up in an asylum. I have had it with this shit, I keep telling them over and over again to at least try and read something on depression but they do not fucking care, yet they want me to think that they care about me?Bull-fucking-shit they do not give a fuck about me, they only care about how they will be viewed by others after I kill myself.I thought I finally after 13 years got a little better but thanks to my dickhole family I am right back where I started and I have had enough.They can go fuck themselves, I am about to order a 8 liter bottle of nitrogen and a oxygen mask, maybe then I can finally get some rest.Who knows, maybe I will even be reincarnated as a cute girl, that would be neat, or I will fade into nothingness, or maybe I will go to hell, I do not fucking know, I am sick of this shit and because I have decided to not bother my friends with my last attempt, I am here, I do not know why, maybe I want to be remembered but I am here for some reason or desire, maybe it is my survival instinct trying to cling on. what is the fucking point",Suicidal
13200,"Without negotiation we are expected to go to high school full weeks, go to college full weeks, go to work full weeks. After that, you retire, have a little bit of freedom and then you die. The thought of this makes me escape in a bubble where I am not open to new things, do not want to go outside unless necessary, can have high anxiety and I also escape excessively in unhealthy eating and hobbies.I often want to be a NEET without money problems. Life would be perfect. I do not feel like this always. But recently I have been feeling like this a lot. Why/how eventually can you go passionate to work, when you know you are being screwed with until this point from birth on? I also do not care about changing/having impact on the world or making a lot of strangers happy. A lot of people see that as a motivation and passion for the job. I just cannot see it that way. The people that I care about and have build a relationship with are the ones I want to do something for, not billions of people. The inventors of this system probably do not want people to ask questions. They do not ever consider it to change. They just want us to be obedient cogs in society. I wish for an automated society: No capitalism, infinite resources (maybe mined from other planet and then have a machine that can build anything out of the basic molecules) , everything is automated by machines and everybody can do what they want. If people want to work, they replace a robot. They do not get paid,because they do this for their enjoyment. I do not want there to be money at all. Maybe, more like an allowance that is just put on your bank account by an algorithm. Everybody gets the same allowance every month, it is enough to buy things todays rich people can buy, but not enough to let one person deplete an entire stock of something like luxury cars. Where you buy from, I want to be a algorithmic system that is backed by robots. So, if you buy a car, no person gets the money. The money is just removed from your balance, your points that you can spend that month. Robots then deliver the car to your house.Why keep living for survival if we could in the future live only for enjoyment? Not enough freedom in life",Depression
